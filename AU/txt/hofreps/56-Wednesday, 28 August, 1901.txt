                    <para>- I propose to move for a reconsideration of this clause, in order to insert a regulation conferring certain powers, and providing for an extension of the powers contained in clause 25. The purpose of the amendment will be, as far as practicable, to preserve, to individual societies or others, whatever rights they may have in their own States for the transmission of postal matter free. I allude especially to such postal matter as is authorized by some of the States in connexion with elections. The regulation, however, is not yet ready, and therefore, if honorable members have any opinions to express in respect of that matter, I ask them to reserve them for another occasion. The purpose of the regulation will be to embrace all such matters as the separate States - one or many of them - may include in their own legislation. If, therefore, any State has taken upon itself the responsibility of a regulation empowering the transmission through the Postal department of any matter free, the Commonwealth will undertake to deliver such matter, but not to deliver it free because our Inter-State keeping of accounts for five years will prevent that. The Commonwealth will undertake to deliver all such matter to the officer authorized to receive it upon such officer paying, for it. This provision will thus extend the purpose of clause 2-5, as I promised it should be extended when it was before the committee. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to direct attention to sub-clause (*), which prescribes the mode of dealing with parcels which are supposed to contain dutiable articles. I wish to make it plain that the department - when it examines such parcels, and arrives at what is the customs duty payable upon them - shall undertake the task of delivering those articles to the person to whom they are addressed. I understand that the customs examination may take place at a port, whereas the article may be addressed to some person in the interior of the Commonwealth, who thus might have to employ an agent in the port where the customs duty is assessed to take charge of the article and insure its safe delivery. I think that the Postal department ought to be prepared to facilitate the transmission of4 all such goods, and ought not to put the addressee to any expense or trouble in securing his-goods after he has paid all proper dues. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- Though I sympathize with the general-, purpose which the honorable member has in view, namely, that the greatest, facilities shall be given for the transmission of goods -even though they may be dutiable- - through the Post-office, yet, after consulting with .those who are more immediately in charge of this department, I am not able to concur in. the view that this is- practicable. It might be practicable under specially disadvantageous circumstances to the department. The present practice is for the article liable to duty to be deposited at an office where there is an officer of the department who is sworn to perform certain duties- under the Customs Act. That officer is therefore directly responsible to the Audit department for the revenue he ' may collect. Every article liable to customs duty when received at the department should have affixed on the outside its value in such a form that it may be fairly assessed. But frequently articles contain no notice of their value on the outside, and it is- necessary for the Customs official to send for the ordinary valuator to assess their value. It is the duty of this Custom-house officer is to account the Audit department for the receipt of this money. But if we are to undertake the delivery of these articles, the Custom-house officer at the Post-office must collect from the postman the money which he is to receive before he allows him to take charge of the parcel, or else he must make him responsible for bringing back the money. That will apply so far as the city and suburbs are concerned. But let us suppose that we have a parcel addressed to Melbourne which may require to be delivered at Auburn, five or six miles away. Then the parcel must go out of the hands of the Custom-house officer at Melbourne into the possession of a man who is not a Custom-house officer at Auburn, and, as I am informed, the duties of the auditor would be very largely extended if he had to follow it up in various directions. May I point out to my honorable friend that he does not say where this postal article is to be delivered. If it is to be delivered to the addressee, we may have a Customhouse officer, in Melbourne whilst the addressee may be at Sunbury. In such an instance we should have to follow the parcel through various post-offices, and make a record of it at each post-office through, which it passed. The proposed amendment would duplicate the work. which a registered package involves. Altogether the department say that it is a novelty, that they do not know, where such a system is carried out, and that- they hesitate to adopt it. In Tasmania we do not adopt such u system. There a postal article is received at Launceston or Hobart'. At each, of such places there is-a Customs officer. At either of those places a package containing dutiable articles must pay the duty imposed. Is it necessary to involve the department in the heavy additional work which the proposed amendment would throw upon it? </para>

                    <para>- In any case, the present system is a faulty one, and any amendment of it must be iii the direction of facilitating public business. The Minister in charge of the Bill has told us that the great difficulty in regard to this proposal would be the question of audit. If one of the departments concerned remained under- State control, then there might be some objection : but, as both the Customs and Postal departments have been transferred to the Commonwealth, there should be nodifliculty in giving. this advantage to the public. The Customs department in Melbourne has found it practicable to utilize the services of railway officials in collecting revenue, and why should not postmasters be allowed to do the same ? I fail to see that this would occasion any grave necessity for keeping, a mass of records, and I think that the Minister might very, well consent to the amendment. </para>

It is all a matter of regulation, and I think one might very well trust- the Postmaster-General to frame such regulations as will best secure public convenience in: this as in every other matter. It is going, a little too far to declare, under this clause, precisely what regulations are to be made. If we followed that line of conduct to its logical sequence, we should have to frame to its fullest possible extent every possible direction that is proposed to be left to regulation. </para>

                <para>Mr.DEAKIN. - The Post-office is loth to undertake this duty. I do not think, however, that this would be regarded as a sufficient objection to the adoption of this proposal, provided that honorable members had. an opportunity of hearing the department's objections, and of considering whether they were of merely temporary cogency or such as should have permanent effect. I was very much struck while in India with the facilities afforded by the Post-office in this very regard, and the immense convenience it had proved in that country. I know of no other country where a similar convenience would be more appreciated than in this, and so far as to the object of the amendment, I am quite in sympathy. But we are providing here for a general regulation which would enable the Post-office to undertake this very duty, or to adopt some other scheme more in accordance with our requirements and gradually to develop. Those are courses which are open to us without this amendment, but which would be shut out under it. If we adopt the amendment we shall be tied down to attain one excellent object, and to attain it directly under a direction of this committee in a matter which is really after all a question of administration. The honorable member will be quite right in taking the Post-office to task if, in its administration, it does not come up to what is required. We should have better reasons before we bind the Post-office to carry out this proposal only. As it stands, the paragraph prescribes a mode of dealing with postal articles supposed to contain dutiable goods. That covers this and a great variety of other circumstances. If the honorable member's words are added, however, then every other method will be shut out. This general power, which is very elastic, will be narrowed and restricted </para>

Might I suggest to the honorable member that this is a matter of administration on which the Postmaster-General can be asked to either make some analogous proposition or submit reasons why he should not do so. If the honorable member will withdraw his amendment, the Minister in charge of the Bill will undertake to lay such a statement before the House. The House, on the Estimates or on any other occasion, has a matter of this kind under its control, and can give instructions which the Post-office must and ought to obey. Thus, if the Postmaster-General's statement is not satisfactory, the House can direct the work to be done. We shall have the advantage of being able to adopt any system that may appear best if we leave the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- That is a much move difficult matter. There is a very good provision in New South Wales, and I dare say it obtains in other States, under which telegrams are delivered beyond a given radius upon payment of a certain mileage fee. If a rate is fixed for the conveyance of telegrams under a separate Bill from this, that provision may not be taken into account. I would suggest that it might very well be adopted, and also extended to letters, the same mileage rate being paid for the immediate delivery of letters. It would be a great convenience in the case of an urgent letter sent to a postal address at a time when there was no delivery. </para>

                        <para>- I would be only too glad to see a large number of postal matters dealt with by regulation, instead of by fixed provision under the Bill. It seems to me that in dealing with a large service such as the Post and . Telegraph department, with ramifications extending over the whole of . the Commonwealth, we can only lay down the general principles upon which the work shall be carried out. If occasion arises for making a change it is not an easy thing to get an Act altered, whereas regulations can be dealt with in a ready and simple manner, and as they have to be laid before Parliament for approval, an ample safeguard is provided against any improper use being made of the power of regulation reposed in the Executive Government. </para>

The fate of a Government should not rest upon a regulation which might be regarded as -stupid, but Parliament should have the right to challenge any regulations and to disagree with them irrespective of any party considerations. The House should have the same right given to it under this Bill as is given under the other machinery Bills, and I would ask the Attorney-General to give his attention to the concluding paragraph of the clause, which seems to me to stop short of what is required. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is. In a very recent case which was decided by the Privy Council, it was held, if I remember rightly, where similar power was given in somewhat similar words to those now in the clause, that even though the regulations were inconsistent with part of the Act, if it were provided by the Act that they should have the force of law, they would have to be treated as part of the Act, and an effort would have to be made to reconcile the inconsistency, just as if it were an inconsistency between two substantive sections in an Act. I think it is wise to add these words, because we do not wish to give power to make regulations which are inconsistent with the Act. </para>

As one honorable member . has pointed out, the drag-net provisions are more restricted than is customary, but still I think that they will give sufficient authority to make all the regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act.

                        <para>- Honorable members may have much less reluctance in accepting this clause than they would have in ordinary circumstances, because it relates to the postage stamps which are used by the public. If any person to use an Americanism is found " monkeying " with stamps it may be said - unless he is a stamp collector - that he is seeking deliberately to defraud the public for his own gain by committing a forgery which it is very difficult to detect. Consequently, it has been found necessary everywhere in this regard, as in the case of bank notes, to adopt very severe precautions against public robbery. There can be no object in a. man having these dies in his possession unless it be to defraud the public, except he be a philatelist. He is either a philatelist or a forger, and the chances are that he is the hitter. </para>

Therefore if a man privately causes to be used any die, plate, or other instrument he must be convicted. It is all covered by the words "with evil intent." </para>

Under this clause the question will not be left to anybody of that sort, but will, I presume, be decided by a Supreme Court Judge, who will, be able to determine in the fairest possible way what is blasphemy in its legal sense, and punishable, as such.

Any man who may see anything in a postal article which he deems to be blasphemous, indecent, or obscene may give information, and have the question decided by a Judge. There is no authority given to open anything under this clause, which only provides that a person who does a certain thing shall, as a matter of judicial decision, be punished. </para>

                        <para>- There need not be a paid or experienced magistrate on the bench. Under the clause, two particularly narrow-minded justices might consider that an artistic photograph brought, say, from the Paris Exhibition, came under the provision, and could imprison a person for two years. There is being introduced into the Bill an offence which, after -all, is a matter of interpretation. What one may deem an indecent picture, may be. a perfectly harmless and artistic production in the opinion of another ; and yet such a question is to be left to two justices of 'the peace. There are many highly respectable justices, but there are also some very narrow-minded men amongst them, -with no judicial experience whatever. A highly respectable citizen might be put into a false position by the operation of such a clause as this. </para>

                <para>Mr.V. L. SOLOMON.- This clause goes a great deal further than is necessary under any Postal Act. As I read it, any person who receives a letter which he regards as grossly offensive, can proceed under the clause, whereas all that should be considered by the Post-office, should be that which can be seen by the official who handles the postal matter or the postman who delivers it. The words " therein " and " grossly offensive " should be struck out. </para>

That will give a wholesome guarantee to the individual charged that he will not be subject to the caprice and want of knowledge of a casual bench. </para>

                <para>These words seem to give power, by inference at any rate, to open any letters, packets, or newspapers. Supposing that a letter contained anything that was objectionable, the letter would have to be opened to enable the postal authorities to ascertain whether it would come within the provisions of this clause. It is perfectly reasonable that we should stop from passing through the post any packet containing on the outer cover anything offensive, but the same objection does not apply to a letter, the contents of which are closed up and concealed from observation. </para>

                    <para>- I really fail to see the necessity for this clause at all. The postal authorities enter into contracts with certain persons for the carriage of mails. Apparently they are not satisfied with the penalties provided in those contracts for loss of time, because they want to go past the. contractor and to impose penalties upon his employes. That is an improper thing for us to attempt. I feel certain that the Minister in charge of this Bill could not have given consideration to this clause, otherwise it would have been eliminated. For instance, if the mail driver loiters upon the road he is to be subject to a penalty of £10. "What right have we to interfere with the driver when the contractor is liable? Then, again, provision is made that any person in charge of a mail who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor's shall be liable to a penalty of £10. Surely that is the business of the contractor? </para>

                        <para>- I was not responsible for its appearance in the Victorian Act, and I think it is not only absolutely unnecessary, but improper. If the State employed its own vehicles for the performance of this work it would perhaps be worth while to provide a penalty in the case of a man losing time on the road ; but to think of bringing pressure to bear in this way upon employes under a contract is unworthy of the committee. The railway services of the different States have not yet been handed over to the Commonwealth, and it should be borne in mind that under this clause the driver of a railway engine would be liable to a penalty of £10 for losing time on the road. I hope the Minister in charge of the Bill will agree to the deletion of the clause. </para>

                    <para>- This is another instance of Parliament unfortunately trying to deal with subjects which should be matter for regulation. Fancy a Parliament like this solemnly passing a measure by which a driver of a vehicle is to be liable to a penalty of £10 for loitering with mails on the road. Out of the 150 clauses in the Bill at least 90 deal with matters for regulations only. Acts emanating from this House, at all events, should lay down great principles. They should do nothing more. Parliament is not here to manage affairs; it is here to control their management, and by putting provisions like this into a Bill we are simply wasting time and making a farce of the Legislature. No doubt there will be a discussion whether, under this clause, the driver of a vehicle for the conveyance of mails can be fined £10 for drunkenness, when under ordinary circumstances a man can only be fined £2. Surely it would be far better to withdraw the clause. We have already had a discussion on another Bill upon the question of whether a boy should retire from the service at sixteen or eighteen years of age, and we have had a long discussion upon the question whether one or two officials should be in the room at the time that certain articles are being opened. One wonders what sort of people they are who suggest such provisions. I think they should be embalmed, for they must be men who believe that all legislative wisdom is in themselves. Much as I blame the Ministry,' I believe that if they had had time to go' through the Bill carefully they would have struck out one-half of the clauses. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the Minister in charge of the Bill will drop this clause. I know, that it has been made the means of petty persecution. The State is already guarded, under its contracts, against any lapses on the part of contractors or their employes. In cases of petty spite the provision has been used by people goingtothePost-otKceandmaking.com- plaints when there was really no occasion for them. It frequently happens that a. driver has to delay a little in some parts of the road, but on the whole he completes his journey within the specified time. J feel certain that the service can go on without this clause, and that, by its absence, a number of men who have a lot of difficulties to put up with will be relieved. </para>

In other cases, I have known drivers of vehicles for the conveyance of mails to be intoxicated. There is always a danger of postal parcels being lost while the men are in that condition, because it is the custom in the country to deliver letters along the road. As to the point raised by the honorable member for Laanecoorie, he will find that under the railway regulations the driver of an engine has to give an account for loss of time on the road. </para>

At present it is no use applying to the Postmaster-General for anything, his answer being that he has no authority to carry out any of the work suggested. We have taken away all authority from the various State Postmasters-General, and yet we are not in a position to do anything ourselves, merely because of the inability of the Ministry to grasp the position. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment ought not to be passed without consideration. 1 take it that, under the amendment, a man who had a contract allowing him to use 20 miles of line, and who wanted an additional 10 miles, might be able to get that extra mileage -without the Postmaster being able to make any extra charge. If the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, who now have permission under contract to put up private lines in New South Wales, and, I believe, in one or two of the other States, wanted, a few years hence, to extend their lines, we might be bound, under the amendment, to let them have that extension under the same conditions, in the total, as laid down in their existing contracts. I think it will be as well to leave the clause so that every fresh contract may be the subject of an arrangement between the Postmaster-General and the person desiring to make it.

There have been cases ' n Queensland where a teamster has knocked down a telegraph pole by accident, and has .been arrested by au officious policeman, and put to a great deal of inconvenience, owing to his waggon and team and load being left on the road without any protection, and I desire to prevent anything of that kind being repeated. </para>

According to the way in which the clause is now worded, an act may be unlawful without being malicious, or malicious without being unlawful. If an act is unlawful, what does it matter whether it is malicious or not ? I think that this furnishes an additional reason for adopting the suggestion of the honorable member for Maranoa. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think the two words are to be read in the exclusive sense suggested by the honorable and learned member for Indi, but that the object is to relieve the department of the necessity of proving malice, and simply to require them to prove intention. A thing may be done deliberately but not maliciously, and a negligent act would not be a malicious act, but the word " unlawfully " would very probably cover cases of that kind. The difficulty we are faced with in all these clauses is that they may be looked at from extreme points. "We may look at the accidental breaking of an instrument which would merit no punishment, but on the other hand the damage to an instrument might be . the result of a deliberate wicked desire for gain. I confess that I do not like the antithesis suggested by the honorable and learned member for Indi, and I will endeavour to find a new phrase, which will give protection against the more serious offences, and omit the lighter ones. </para>

No option of a fine is given, and I think the provision as it stands is very unreasonable. A messenger carrying a telegraphic message might be obstructed in some way only technically malicious, and yet the person obstructing him would be liable under this clause to imprisonment for three years. We have made provision in another part of the Bill that any person who obstructs an officer in the execution of his duty, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £10, and I think that a fine, especially if the limit is fixed at a high amount, would be quite sufficient to meet all the necessities under this clause. At any rate the option should be given to the courts to inflict a fine. </para>

We cannot extend that system under the present conditions without affecting the telephone service, and the fault is largely the fault of the Post-office in that it has not the metallic circuit. Yet this clause provides for the imposition of penalties, although it is recognised that the postal department has not the metallic circuit and consequently cannot be properly protected. </para>

I think that a hue should be distinctly drawn between the cases of electric tramways which have been authorized in the past and those of similar bodies applying to Parliament for like powers in the future. Even sub-clause (3) of clause 142 will not meet the case. We ought to provide that electric tramways which are already authorized, and which have constructed works under an existing law, ought not to be made subject to the prohibition contained in this Bill so long as they are using all reasonable and known precautions to avoid injuring the telegraph lines. </para>

I have received a very strongly worded protest from the town council of Perth in regard to the operation of this clause, which I can conceive will, if allowed to stand, do a great deal of injury to the development of my electorate. We have a very up-to-date electric tramway system there. We are extending it into various' suburbs, and it is proving of immense advantage to the whole electorate, and indirectly to the whole of the State. The Tramway Company use every reasonable precaution, and I cannot see why such electric companies should be penalized, simply because the postal authorities neglect to adopt necessary measures to prevent their service from being injured. The Postal department has the remedy in its own hands. This matter ought to receive very careful consideration at the hands of the Minister before he decides upon a course that will inflict very decided hardship upon electric lighting and tramway companies. </para>

                        <para>- That is the intention. It will be observed that where great power is expended b}' an electric lighting or tram way company in close contiguity with the telegraph lines the Postmaster-General may decide upon the removal either of the wires of the company or of his own wires. But if he insists upon the removal of the existing lines of companies, it must' be done at the expense of the Postal department: We have not operating in this Commonwealth the powers conferred under the Electric Lighting and Power Act of London, which are exercised by a, Board of Trade. We have not any genera] Board of Trade which can. issue regulations under which a tramway or lighting company may erect and carry on its works. We want, therefore, some power in the State, and the Government think that the power to protect the rights of the people should rest with the Postmaster-General as the representative of the people. If it be necessary from time to time to extend the existing lines of tramway or of lighting, and if those lines have been first in the field, I do not think that there will, be any great difficulties. But if the telegraph line has been established first, then, owing to the enormous power which must pass along electric tramway lines, the latter must keep out of the way. </para>

                        <para>- Why not give to the Postmaster-General the power to deal with this matter on behalf of the people ? Seeing that for a very long time we cannot establish the metallic circuit except a.t enormous expense, why should the Government, after having been first in the field, have to incur a huge outlay in order that some tramway or lighting company shall be benefited ? If it be necessary to run the telegraph wires down a back street, then let it be clone at the expense of the company which is going to monopolize a road that ought to belong to the public. </para>

                    <para>- In many places the municipalities control and own the tram lines, and the argument is that the municipalities have the first call upon and should have the first use of their roads. What I fear is, however, that electric lighting and tramway authorities will be very much restricted, not only in regard to the running of electric trams, but also in relation to electric lighting, if the provisions of this clause be carried out in their entirety. I would therefore ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to try and modify these powers. The tendency is for these electric lighting and tramway undertakings to be under the control either of the Government or of the municipalities, and the power of the latter is paramount to that of the Government. I should like to see the Postmaster-General modify the clause, and not make it restrictive against such authority. </para>

                    <para>- I think this provision is wise so far as it relates to private companies. There is one matter, however, to which attention has not yet been drawn in the discussion on this clause. In Sydney the falling of telephone wires on the electric tramway lines is a source of great danger. Many of the wires used by the department break and fall upon the electric tram wires. Recently the department's cable house was set on fire owing to a telegraph wire falling on the overhead tram cable, and. in another case a cab-horse was killed in the same way. The telephone and telegraph wires must be carried through the main streets, and. the telephone wires must cross the electric tram lines. In Sydney the tramway system is part of the Railway department. We cannot have a divided authority, and as some of the States do control the erection of electric tram wires, altogether separate from private companies this matter should receive attention. Some provision should be made for determining the conflicting interests of the parties. It is manifestly unfair to confine the whole authority to the Postmaster-General and to enable him to say to a State or municipality - " You must erect your tramway system, or put up your wires, in a certain way." Some provision should be made in such a measure as. this to enable the matter to be dealt with either by arbitration or by other means. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the last speaker so far as private companies are concerned. The absence of a provision dealing with matters such as this, and making private companies correct the mischief they do to the telephone system, recently cost the Western Australian Government between £7,000 and £S,000. At the same time I would be sorry to see the full powers proposed by the clause given to the Postmaster-General. I think it is highly necessary that the whole of the people of the Commonwealth should be protected against any expenditure for the benefit of a private company in connexion with the extension of the tramways system ; but that extension is very desirable, and I should not like to see it restricted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That definition states that "injuriously affected" means affected in. any manner. If the people intended that the Federal Government should have such a power over all these services they would have provided under the Constitution Act for the transfer of them to the Commonwealth. They did not do so : they simply handed over the one service, and I venture to think there is not such a provision in any other Postal Act so stringent as this. Although the State authorities conduct telegraph and telephone departments, in the States, there is no such stringent and unworkable provision. This clause would affect the Government of New South Wales, and probably the Governments of some other States, so far as the running of electric trams are concerned. All extensions of electric tram lines would be absolutely blocked by it. It would also affect the municipal council of a city like Sydney, which is now undertaking the lighting of the city by electricity. They would be told - "They axe your roads, but we, the Federal Government, order you off, you shall not go on to any street in the city or suburbs on which our lines are extended." Surety the committee would never pass such a clause. I would urge the Minister to hold back the clause for reconsideration. Failing that it should be rejected. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Government will see the wisdom of reconsidering this clause, and ascertaining whether it is not possible to erect some proper tribunal as between the Post-office and the State or other authorities which may desire to extend their electric systems. 1 am quite in sympathy with the idea with which this clause is put forward, namely, that the Post-office should' not be put to enormous expense in regard to metallic returns, simply because some one comes along and erects an. overhead or underground system of electric traction wires contiguous to the department's works. The principle underlying it, that no one acting in that way should do so without contributing something to repair any damage done to the already existing lines of the Postmaster-General, is a very proper one. The fact that we have not had anything of a like character in our various State Acts is due to the primary reason that the developments of electric traction are so recent that there has been little time to have special legislation on the subject. In the old land there exists the Board of Trade to act as arbitrator between the conflicting interests of the companies and municipalities who engage in these -works, and in view of that fact I think that some body should be set up which will measure the disadvantages suffered by the Postmaster- General or the municipalities, as the case may be, and arrive at an equitable decision. I do not want to vote against this clause, although I do not like it in its present shape. If the Government can see their way clear either to postpone it or promise recommittal a little later on, so that they may consider whether the course I have suggested should not be adopted, I think that will meet the point fairly well. The Attorney-General shakes his head at the idea of any one outside the Commonwealth having any claims as against the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- If the whole of the people are to prevent development on the part of a section of the people, then that section may have very large claims at equity. The city of Sydney, and towns which desire to adopt the electric lighting or tram system, may have good ground for complaint if their claims are not submitted to a third party. I really think the Postmaster-General and his officers are likely to be prejudiced in these matters. They look, very naturally, to their own department first of all, and very secondarily to the interests of other parties, whether represented by a municipality or a private company. I therefore think that there ought to be a court set up to which application might be made to draw a distinction in equity between the interests of the parties. </para>

                    <para>- In this and succeeding clauses, the Government has treated too cavalierly the claims of municipalities. It is a mistake to suppose that the main interests of the people are centred in the use of electricity as applied to telegraph and telephone lines, because the advantages the community obtain from electricity in the shape of traction and illuminating power are of greater value. The Government propose to assume control and prevent people having the great use of electricity they can have in municipal government. In clause after clause, the position is assumed that in every way the Commonwealth shall protect its own lines of telephone communication, and exclude the powers municipal authorities ought to have of using this force for municipal purposes. Day by day we see the extension of electrical power in cities and suburbs, and the municipalities of Redfern and other places will find their powers very largely interfered with by this Bill. The greatest good to the greatest number is to be achieved by using electricity for municipal purposes, and not only for Post-office purposes, and there ought to be some authority to settle between conflicting interests. Some of the clauses interfere with powers given to municipal corporations under existing State Acts ; and municipalities are called on to comply, not only with State Acts, but also with this Bill. The suggestion of the honorable member for Bland is an extremely wise one, and the Government ought to postpone the clause, and take advice as to how far the two powers come into conflict, with a view of devising some means of settling the conflict not altogether in favour of the Post-office. </para>

I doubt very much whether the Minister's interjection, that this is a question of the whole of the people against a section of the people, bears very much on the case. If we continue to insert clauses which so directly affect the interests not only of one State, but of the different States, we may be clashing with the interests of the majority of the people ; and I question whether it is advisable, even though we may possibly have the power, to practically nullify State Acts in the way some of the clauses propose. All the rights that corporations have under existing State Acts must be regarded and preserved by the Commonwealth Parliament, and some board ought to be appointed to settle differences between the two bodies. </para>

If some independent authority could be constituted which would deal with all interests fairly, it would be a good way out of the difficulty ; but unless we can do that we shall certainly have to repose in our own authority some control, if not all the control specified, trusting to its being justly exercised. This principle appears to have governed legislation in the past, both in Great Britain and the colony. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Attorney-General will withdraw this clause for further consideration, because there is no other similar clause in operation in any part of the Commonwealth at the present time. I think it is better that the Commonwealth Government should be put to a little inconvenience than that the systems that are in operation in the various large cities throughout the States should be brought to a stand-still or to a very large extent injured. We know that in England the tendency is to place all such services as tramways, electric lighting systems, and telephone services under municipal control, and when we have comprehensive local government laws throughout the Commonwealth, it is very probable that municipal control will be very largely extended. It would be a mistake to pass this clause, and to bring several large and important works, such as those. now contemplated in Sydney, to a stand-still, and I hope the Government will see the wisdom of reconsidering the clause so that justice may be done, not only to the people of Sydney, but also to those of Perth and Launceston and other places. </para>

In connexion with that, I stated that the Commonwealth represented the whole of the people, whilst the others referred to' by the honorable member for Bland represented only a section of the -people. . We must all admit that this House would be adopting a reactionary policy if in this measure it endeavoured in any way to set bounds to the development of electricity, from which Ave hope so much in a great variety of ways. </para>

                    <para>- I think that this clause involves a very grave responsibility. The first question which I ask myself is - Have we the power to pass such a clause % and the next is - If we have the power, is it desirable that we should exercise it*? I am convinced that it would not be wise for the Commonwealth Parliament to endeavour to exercise this power. Jost as in other parts of the Bill we have strong evidence of the trend of the official mind, so we have it here in its very quintessence. We have here expressed the feeling which has been engendered by years of trouble on the part of the postal authorities, b}' reason of the conflict which has arisen between the varying interests mentioned in these clauses. For a considerable time the postal officials have been endeavouring to cope with the curse of induction, which has caused the telephonic communication in one of the States at a certain period of the day to become almost useless. But the solution of this difficulty is not to be found in retarding the development of electrical science. It is to be found rather in the grounding of the wires used in the telephonic service. There are certain aesthetic reasons why we should do away with the overhead wires, but the purely commercial reason is that we should then get rid of the induction, which undoubtedly to a large extent limits the use of the telephonic system. Last year- the Victorian Government considered this question of grounding the telephone wires. Estimates were prepared, and had the McLean Government remained in power they would have started the work of grounding the wires in the metropolis. The adoption of that plan would obviate the trouble with, which Ave are confronted in this Bill. I am very loath to do anything which may be regarded as an interference Avith the rights of the various States. At the commencement of our federal existence it is very necessary that everything should work Avith the utmost smoothness. We were told only a few hours ago of the derangement of the finances of the State of Victoria owing to the federal expenditure exceeding the amount which it was thought would be incurred. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that it is true ; but that matter would be a small one compared with the outcry which would be raised if we passed such a clause as this. The adoption of this provision means that we shall stop electrical development within the Commonwealth. In Victoria, I am proud to think that we have made tremendous strides in the use of electricity. We find that the machinery for our mines is being driven by electricity. The passage of such a provision as this would _ mean almost the complete stoppage of that machinery. In one mine that I know of, there is electrical communication between the power house and various portions of a very large lease. The cables are laid along the public roads. It would have been impossible to have had those cables there if this clause had been in operation. Not only do I think that it is advisable to postpone the clause, but I believe that the committee should strike it out altogether. It is far better to leave matters as they are, than to commit what I think would be an undoubted interference with the rights of the States. The federal authority might in the future find itself barred by this clause if it were passed into law. It might be considered advisable some time hence for the federal authority to take over electric power in any part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- The purport of this clause apparently is to place the whole control of the use of electricity in the hands of the Postmaster-General. I should like to say that such a step is totally opposed to the tendency of the times, which is to place all electrical power, so far as cities are concerned, in the hands of the municipal authorities. In all the great cities of the world there is a tendency on the part of the State to divest itself of certain powers, and to vest them in the local authorities whenever that can be done with benefit to the whole people. That it can be done with benefit to the whole people is very apparent in these days of specialization, and I do not think it requires any argument to prove that the municipality is the proper authority to control the telegraph " wires, and, indeed, everything which runs through the streets. If I had my way I would give to the municipal authorities supreme control of the streets. In Sydney there are five or six authorities, each one apparently having concurrent powers, and no one having supreme control. We have witnessed most ridiculous episodes as the result of this divided responsibility. This Bill has evidently been constructed on the scissors and paste principle with unlimited elbow room, and this particular provision is inserted for no other reason than that it is contained in the Queensland Act. </para>

                        <para>- The clause gives the Postmaster-General power to do certain things. Nothing can be done without his approval. Under this provision no authority can lay down a line of tramway without the Postmaster-General's consent. The subject bristles with difficulties. The Attorney-General is not in a position to say what is likely to be an injury to or what is likely to "prejudicially affect" the working of the telegraph lines. I should like to obtain some definite understanding as to the limitations of the clause. I do not wish to delay the committee, but I certainly think the powers it gives are excessive and unnecessary - excessive, because other interests equally as important as those of the Post and Telegraph department are concerned, and unnecessary because all that the clause aims at can be achieved in a very much less drastic provision. </para>

Their report may give us an opportunity of settling this question. I pointed out before that, so far from desiring to discourage or interfere with, it will be the desire of the Government to encourage, the utilization of electricity by municipalities or States, or even by companies, where these are not available. The only question for which we have to find a solution is as to who is to pay, under the various conditions, for the necessary outlay to enable the telephone system . to be continued without injury from either the electric lighting or tramway system. In one case it may be the business of the department, and in the other it may be the business of the person who owns the electric tramway or lighting works. It is for that purpose that I am asking that these clauses be passed with a few amendments, of which notice has been given, on the understanding that they will be recommitted. </para>

                    <para>- - I am not one of those who pre-supposes, because some drastic powers are given to the Government, that necessarily they will be exercised. I think it is essential very frequently that we should give the fullest powers to the Government in order that they may deal with cases which do require very arbitrary -measures. The Government must have realized the enormous interests which exist in connexion with electric lighting and power works, and also the great interests which have yet to grow up in relation to them. I think, therefore, we cannot be too guarded against giving the slightest suggestion to these various interests that they are going to be interfered with. The remarks which have fallen from honorable members must have convinced the Attorney-General and the Minister in charge of the Bill that there is a fear that the placing of these arbitrary powers in the hands of the Government may be prejudicial to these great interests. They are, of course, private interests, in some cases, while in others they are the semi-public interests of municipalities or the interests of the States, while the Commonwealth has also interests which must be considered. I am of opinion that it is hopeless to think of effectively dealing with the enormous interests which have to be safeguarded by means of a few clauses in a measure of this kind. My feeling is that the matter can only be properly dealt with by a comprehensive measure relating to electric light and power. Therefore, I would venture to suggest to the Attorney-General whether it would not be possible to so adjust the mandatory clauses which exist . in the Bill that for the present session, and during the recess, the powers which exist in the State laws may be exercised by the department; and that he should make a promise that in the coming session the Government will bring forward a comprehensive measure dealing with all these matters. I am perfectly certain that if he does he will remove the objections which several honorable members entertain. He will also remove the fears which are held by representatives of a large number of vested interests that they are to be seriously affected if these clauses are put into operation. My own feeling is that the fears may be exaggerated, because I do not believe it is the intention of the Government to apply these provisions . in any way to the disadvantage of the interests involved. There is a large amount of outside capital now being introduced into the Commonwealth for the extension of electric lighting and power systems, and this great power of electricity has to be safeguarded with many conditions which do not . apply to almost any other great undertaking. The railways, and our streets and roads, and all other public concerns can be safeguarded on known lines, but electricity operates in so many ways, and is being so constantly improved upon, that what is a novelty to-day is ancient a few months hence. Electric power is increasing rapidly, and I feel that if we are to attract capital for these great enterprises we must not convey the impression to the public that the Government are taking 'intotheir hands a system of arbitrary control'. - </para>

                        <para>- That must be done, but capital' ready to be invested- in these directions will easily take fright. There is a great deal in the suggestion that the Postmaster-General should not be the sole arbiter in these matters ; that there ought to be a properly-constituted body to deal with this highly technical subject, to which the merits or demerits of, any supposed interference with' the- department's wires might be submitted and properly adjudicated upon. I venture to suggest that the matter might be. so adjusted, that until, the whole question is dealt with in a comprehensive manner by a separate. Bill, the Postal department shall deal with these interests under the State legislation as it exists up to the point at which new legislation is created. </para>

I would suggest that the clause should be postponed with a view to giving the fullest consideration to all those factors which require to be taken into account, so that while we may safeguard the Post and Telegraph department from injury, we may also give satisfaction to those States 'and municipal bodies which, on their own lines, are trying to develop electrical facilities for the public good. </para>

                    <para>- There are three interests involved in this matter. The interests of the Commonwealth in connexion with the Telegraph department, the interests of the Construction branch of the Public Works department and the interests of the various municipal bodies who are carrying on electric enterprise. In speaking to a gentlemen connected with the Railway department in New South Wales yesterday, he expressed the opinion that unless this clause were altered it would very materially affect the interests of his department. It becomes a question now as , to whether we, as a Parliament, should endeavour to retain as many rights -to ourselves as we possibly can, or whether we should not give every reasonable right to municipal bodies and State Governments consistent with the conservation of our own immediate interests. Will the State Governments consider our interests where they think that they have any rights ? While we are passing our laws ought we not to embody in them every power which is conferred upon us by the Constitution? I am sure that the Commonwealth Government will not exercise any power to the injury of State rights. I presume that the States have their rights. But under the Constitution Act we also have defined rights, and whilst we would naturally give every consideration to the rights which belong to the State Parliaments, I do not know that we should be acting wisely by doing anything to weaken our own position. </para>

                        <para>- We must not interfere with the rights of the municipal bodies, or of the Public Works department. That, I think, is the trend of the argument which has been urged this evening. I do not think that we need go so far out of our way to consider those interests. We should enact laws which will reserve to ourselves the fullest possible power. It would be advantageous if the Attorney-General could give the committee some intimation regarding the date to which the consideration of these clauses is to be postponed. There are many interested in them, and now that the matter has been discussed it will attract public attention, and be more fully thought of than it has been up to the present. It would be well if the Minister could discuss this matter with the railway constructing authorities' branches in the different States, and ascertain how far they are affected. We know that in Sydney a number of the telephones will not work because of the electric trams. </para>

The proposal is submitted because the Postmaster-General, being of an exceedingly timid nature, apprehends that there may possibly arise this interference, although no earthly grounds may exist for his belief. I hope that in the modification of the clause, the Attorney-General will see that the broader rights of the people, of municipalities, and of State Governments are not interfered with to anything like the degree that this clause proposes. </para>

                    <para>- And it has been before this House for about a fortnight ! The committee of electrical experts to whom I refer sat in Adelaide and finished their work about a fortnight since. If their report is likely to throw any light upon this subject, it seems rather a pity that the Government have not read it. I admit that there is a great deal in the point urged by the Attorney-General, that the question at issue is as to who shall pay. Of course the telephones . can be protected. The induction in the telephone system can be prevented by putting the wires underground. Whilst I .am prepared to allow the municipal authorities or a board representing the municipal or State authorities to have some jurisdiction in this matter, I must admit that there is a good deal in the contention of the Attorney-General that the question of priority has some bearing upon it. Let .us take the case of Adelaide, where the experience has been quite the opposite to that of Sydney. For a number of years we have had telephonic communication in Adelaide, but it is only just now that the question of electric lighting is being brought forward. A company has come along which, for private gain, proposes to light the dwellings of the city and also some of the streets with electricity. Who should stand aside and pay the cost"! The Westinghouse Company also propose a private electric tramway scheme, and a Bill is now before the State Parliament, which proposes to give the company certain rights. I am afraid ' that the measure 'will be carried, and, if so, -we shall then have a private company rtatraing the 'tramway system "for private gain. Because this 'company comes along and upsets the whole 'of the telephone system,are the people of Australia to go to the expense of providing a metallic 'circuit? </para>

                        <para>- That does not affect the qtfestibn at 'all. I am talking about whose business it is to pay, because owing solely to the fact that these companies are using electricity for traction and lighting purposes, the 'whole telephone -business has been ''upset. But for these companies laying down their lines there would be no induction at -all. I think, therefore, that there is something in the Attorney-General's argument that it is a question of whether the Government, in cases where the telephone wires were'laid down first, should -not have the power to say that those wires shall not be interfered with except under certain conditions. </para>

'Now it is proposed to being the .works of " the city of Sydney into conflict with this measure. I trust that the Attorney-General will .accept my suggestion. If we insert this proviso, the trouble and .expense "".of making alterations wall -not be entirely on the municipalities or private companies, but the Government will pay their-fair proportion. </para>

If we have a Federal .Government operating throughout Australia, -a State Government operating in each State of Australia, and the municipal governments operating in the different municipalities of Australia, and concessions made or privileges given to companies, or -private individuals in particular places, there is bound to be frequently a conflict of interests.

                        <para>- I do not think clause 1.36 is wider than clause 1-38. Clause 1&gt;86 is merely meant to be a general statement, which is defined by clause 13S. Then there is provision in regard to injury to lines in clause 142. That is the dangerous clause, and I admit there must be some modification of it. Clause 142 is to .the effect- that, . when any lines .ore used fin such manner as to injuriously -affect any line of the Postmaster-General, the Postmaster-General may direct -certain , conditions to be fu'lfilled. There ought to be some provision for arbitration there, because we are giving an arbitrary -power to the Postmaster-General to say to an electric authority - " You.must fulfil the conditions which I prescribe." -I think, however, that we are jumping before we come to the stile. Let us wait until we come to clause 142. There has been some reference to the example of . America ; but there the federal power has not got the telegraph or telephone works at all. The Constitution in America does not give what our Constitution gives to us - the ownership of telegraphic and telephonic communication. But whatever the Constitution gives to the federal authority can be so regulated by the federal authority as to make the federal . works, whatever they are, superior to the works of other parties. Just as in America any interference with a post can be punished under the federal law, just as in America everything has to give way to the United States mail upon the highways and railways of the States, so it is thought that there should be incorporated here a provision that everything must give way to the federal telephone and telegraphic communications. I hope it will be understood by the honorable member for North Sydney, whose remarks certainly impressed me, that I think there must be some modification of clause 142, and that there must be some provision by which the Postmaster-General shall not have the sole right to say what are the conditions to be carried out. We might, however, pass clause 136, especially when we see that it is limited and guarded by clause 1 38. If there is a division upon the matter I will vote with the Government. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the difficulty in which we find ourselves might have been easily foreseen. The Ministry have attempted to . grapple with it as far as they possibly could. In 'almost every State a conflict of the same sort has arisen. I gather from the remarks of the Attorney-General that the difficulty with which he finds himself face to face is as to who shall bear the cost. If the Federal Government were willing to alter their lines, : to make a metallic circuit or to raise the 'height of their wires, the question would arise as to who is to pay for the cost of the work? In the case of lines which have already been constructed, I think that the proposal 'of 'the honorable and learned member for Parkes, is 'one that might very well be considered. Could we not at the same time, however, recognise the lines constructed by the various States, and Gall upon them where an alteration is involved to bear the cost? In Sydney the cost has already been borne 'by the State. If an alteration were made in Melbourne, and the metallic circuit were introduced within the five years period, over which the bookkeeping clauses extend, would the cost fall upon the State of Victoria or upon the Commonwealth? My opinion is that it would fall upon the Commonwealth. I do not think that we could charge any loss against the State except the amount of interest that would fee involved. The suggestions which have already been made by honorable members will perhaps enable the Attorney-General to bring the matter more 'fully before us. The discussion which has taken place shows the great difficulty of dealing with the question. It is one of those matters in the settlement of which we must look for the exercise of forbearance and good sense on the part both of the States, and of . the Commonwealth, if any proper conclusion is -to be-arrived at. </para>

                    <para>- I have to congratulate the Minister who introduced this Bill upon having given us a fairly workable measure. Of course there are many points that will, and indeed have, come under the review of those who are most closely interested in the business of wine-making and distilling in the various States, and, perhaps, more especially in the State of South Australia. Some of these gentlemen have, I believe, interviewed the Minister who framed the Bill. They have also interviewed those who are representing the State in which they are employed, and have pointed out a few amendments which I think the House will be only too glad to make in the measure. Of course we recognise that iri. a Bill of this nature, as in a Customs Bill, -and -every other measure affecting closely the -revenue, it is necessary that the provisions shall be of a much more drastic -character. than those -of a mere machinery Bill, which deals with other departments of less vital import to the Commonwealth. It may be as well to allude to the few faults to be found in this measure with a view of directing the attention of the Minister and of honorable members to the points raised by the principal vignerons and distillers in South Australia. These faults are not very numerous, but in some instances they are undoubtedly of paramount importance to the industry in which those gentlemen are interested. One can only have an idea of the magnitude and importance of the wine-making and distilling industry in South Australia by going through the districts of Angaston and Nuriootpa - the whole Barossa district, in fact - and seeing the advances that have been made during the past few- years. It is not necessary to quote figures to show the additional acreage which has been placed under vines. </para>

                        <para>- I must apologize if, in dealing with districts in which fruit-growing and wine-making occur, I have departed from the rules of debate. No doubt at Mildura and Renmark the cultivation of the grape for raisin purposes has assumed important proportions. In the district of Clare, cultivators, while taking very fine returns from wine-making, have already taken as much as £50 per acre from currant growing. I have no desire to lengthen the debate on a machinery Bill, but I will ask leave to draw attention to a few points which will require consideration when we get into committee. Part 3 of the Bill, which relates to licences, provides for the issue of spirit-makers' licences, for which a heavy sum has to be paid ; for vigneron's licences, authorizing licensees to distil spirits only for the fortification of their own wines, and for test still licences. It is pointed out that spirit-makers' licences should certainly carry with them not only the right of the holders to distil spirits for their own use in the ordinary way, but-also to supply spirits to those wine-makers whose vineyards may not be of sufficient extent to warrant them putting up stills of their own. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill approaches very closely to it. It is pointed out that although a distiller has to pay £50 for his licence, and is under the most stringent regulations, it is doubtful, as the Bill stands, whether he has a right to sell spirits to the smaller wine-maker for the purpose of fortifying wines. </para>

                <para>I can see exactly the object of the clause : that it would hardly be wise for a publican to be licensed to retail and distil spirits. In such a case the difficulty of preventing fraud on the revenue would be very great indeed. I am sure, however, that the word " retail," as used in the clause, requires some closer definition. I have given notice of an amendment to deal with it in a way which I think will meet the case. It certainly does not mean to refer to a person who is licensed to sell spirits by the gallon. The word " retail," in my opinion, refers really to licensed victuallers, and when we get into committee I propose to move for the insertion of the words " in less quantity than one gallon." The gallon licence in some of the States is issued only to storekeepers, and solely in respect of liquor to be consumed away from the licensed premises. </para>

                        <para>- There may be. In submitting my proposed amendment to the committee I shall be quite open to be convinced that it will not meet the case, if the Minister in charge of the Bill can show me that there is good cause for placing a larger interpretation on the word " retail " than that usually given to it. Then in clause 28 I find it is provided that every distiller, in addition to the fair sum which he has to pay for his licence, shall afford reasonable office accommodation for the supervising officer - who is to be in constant attendance at the distillery for the protection of the revenue - and also, if the distillery is distant more than two miles from a licensed public-house, to provide board and lodging for the officer to the satisfaction of the collector. I would point out to the Minister that this clause goes a great deal further than present legislation in South Australia. It would be a very great hardship in many instances if, because of the fact that a distillery was more than two miles distant from a township, the proprietor should be required to provide board and lodging for the officer at his own cost. No doubt it would increase the cost of his licence from £50 to £150. It might involve the distiller in an expenditure of from 30s. to £2 per week to furnish board and lodging for the officer, and unless the Minister can show us that similar conditions obtain at present in some of the States, I think the committee will agree with me that this is a very hard proposal, lt has been pointed put to me by some of the distillers that in South Australia an allowance of £20 per year towards the board and lodging, of the officer is made by the distiller, and that a similar grant is made by the Government. In these, days of cycling, when nearly every man can ride a bicycle, whether an officer has to attend at a distillery two or four miles from an hotel is not a matter of very great moment to him. The distiller has to put up with the inconvenience of not having him on his premises as long as he would otherwise have him there. Clause 32 provides that no other trade is to be carried on upon the premises of a distillery without the permission in writing of the collector. There are distilleries and wineries in Australia where pretty well every business is conducted. I might instance Seppelts' vineyard at Seppeltsfield, one of the largest wine- </para>

                        <para>- Scotland does nob send its best whisky, any way. We can exercise supervision over what is produced here, and that is what we cannot do in regard to what comes from outside. Here we can follow the process from the gathering of the grape or the grain, until it is turned out the finished article, and we can see that nothing deleterious or hurtful is used in the process. Amongst the main objections to the Bill is, first of all, that there is no provision whatever for pure liquor. Nothing in the Bill prescribes, so far as I can see, what the age of the liquor shall be, or what it shall be made from, and there is certainly nothing prohibiting deleterious or noxious materials being used in the manufacture. The next objection is that the Bill plays into the hands of the large distillers and vignerons with large interests, and to a great extent crushes out the small men in both these branches of industry. Then, the Bill does not properly regulate or encourage local production. In regard to the first objection as to pure liquor it only requires honorable members to glance through the Bill to see that my statement is correct, and I need not say more on the point. </para>

                        <para>- I will show that by-and-by; but that the Bill does play into the hands of the' large men is shown in a good many of the provisions. Clause 57 provides that no spirits shall be used for fortifying wines unless they are at least 50 per cent, over-proof. The strength at present is fixed at 25 per cent., and there are many stills in this State which cannot produce liquor 50 per cent, overproof. It is a well-known fact that the larger the still and the swifter the operation, the poorer the liquor - that the slower the process, and the smaller the still, the better and purer the liquor. Then the distilling licence has been raised from £10 up to £50 ; and it seems to me unfair that a distiller who is only turning out a few thousands of gallons per year should pay the same licence as one who is turning out 300,000 or 400,000 gallons. </para>

                        <para>- The point to which I am particularly addressing myself at present is that the Bill plays into the hands of the larger men, and crushes out the smaller men. The 3rd schedule, paragraph 6, provides that the still shall be capable of exhausting at least 150 gallons of wash per hour. There are many stills - indeed, I think the great bulk of the stills in this State - which cannot exhaust that amount, and if that be the case, distilling operations must be left to one or two of the large distillers. We should not aim at playing into the hands of the big men. In addition' to that, I would point out that the slower the distillation the better is the product which is obtained. </para>

                        <para>- It is an absolute fact. It was shown in the evidence given before the select committee in England, and it is shown by the various books which I have read upon the subject.' These provisions will mean the absolute remodelling almost of the premises of distilleries in this State at the present time. Paragraph 44 of schedule 3 provides that vats shall be of at least 500 gallons in capacity. At the present time there is no limit regarding the capacity of vats. Some of these have a capacity of only 150 gallons. Many of the smaller distilleries would, under the operation of this Bill, have to clear out their vats and replace them by larger ones for which their buildings are unsuited. The same schedule also provides that a vigneron's still shall be capable of putting through 50 gallons per hour. The present limit is 25- gallons an hour. This provision, therefore, strikes at the small vigneron. Clause 25 is a very arbitrary one, which virtually provides for confiscation. As I have already pointed out, some of the provisions cannot apply to our present distilleries. They will involve the remodelling of the premises in some cases, and the pulling down and rebuilding of them in others. Clause 24 says - </para>

                        <para>- The English buyers re-, quire a strong wine, not only to suit the palates of the people, but to insure its being kept in good condition during its transit from Australia. The average wines in the north contain 23 or .24 per cent, of spirit, and they require an alcoholic strength of '26 or 28 per cent, before the -English buyers will come in. Consequently, fortification is absolutely .necessary for the larger proportion of the wines produced in this State. There .are two ways of getting this spirit. The first is by obtaining a, small still, and making it in one's own vineyard, and the second is by applying at certain places where one can obtain it under the present law free of duty for fortifying purposes. I do not know if it is intended that the vignerons shall continue to get this fortifying spirit free of duty, but there is nothing in the 'Bill to say that they shall. There is nothing to show that the privilege, which they have hitherto enjoyed will still be extended to them. Leave being granted to me to continue my remarks on a future date, I beg to move - </para>

                        <para>- I wish to bring before the attention of the House and of the Government a matter of some importance. I learn from the newspapers published in Perth that a considerable amount of excitement has been engendered amongst the industrial classes there by the discovery that Hindoos are being employed in some of the tailoring establishments in that city. This is a subject of some importance in view of the fact that we are about to seriously consider the desirability of prohibiting these people from entering the. Commonwealth at all. The fact that they are now to be found in the tailoring industry gives a great deal of point to the contention that if immediate steps are not taken to prevent undesirable immigration, we shall find in the near future all manner of industrial enterprises overrun by these people. </para>

Any one who knows the insanitary condition under which these people live, will agree with me that the unfortunate individuals who are compelled to wear uniforms manufactured in such quarters are very much to be commiserated indeed.

                        <para>- I think the matter brought forward by the honorable member for Perth deserves the attention of the Government. With reference to the interjection made by the Minister of Defence - one time Premier of Western Australia - to the effect that these people cannot come into Western Australia now, I think it is about time for him to quarrel with the 'Government statistician of that State, for that officer says that in the first three months of the present year some 89 Malays came into Western Australia. Then there were Hindoos, Afghans, and Chinese, a variety of Manilla men and men of various colours - black, brown, cream-coloured, and so on. </para>

Lately there have been imported into Fiji a large number of Hindoo artisans' and mechanics, who are displacing the. white engineers previously employed on the sugar plantations there. That is a development of coloured immigration which is very recent. Hitherto the importations have been confined for the most part to ordinary labourers. </para>

I have in my possession -a letter from Mount Garnet complaining of the invasion of that district by Afghans under contract to carry copper to the nearest railway station. They have displaced a number of teamsters - the bone and sinew of the north - who have wives and families to support. These coloured people have been taken there simply to benefit a soulless corporation. The people who have engaged them are making a little profit out of them to the detriment of the whole of the north, and to the special detriment of the men they have displaced. This is a matter which is crying out for the attention of this Parliament, and I hope action will be taken at once. </para>

                        <para>- My only object in rising is to assure honorable members, that since 1897 - when- the Immigration Restriction Act was passed - there has been no introduction of coloured persons into "Western Australia, so far as the southern portions of that State are concerned, contrary to the provisions of that statute. There is a large pearl fishery on the northwest coast, and under the provisions of the law 'the Malays engaged in pearling there are allowed to land at Broome during the off season. A strict account is kept of them ; they are not permitted to go into the country, but are re-embarked after spending a short time on shore. I have not heard of any instance in which these people have gone into the country, lt may be that the census has taken. into account a number of these Malays while they were on shore for a short time. Very much against my wish coloured labour is allowed, to go to the Abrolhos Islands, off the coast of Western Australia, to work the guano deposits that exist there, and it may be that these coloured labourers have been included in the census returns. I say, without any fear of contradiction, that the Act has been carried out faithfully, and that there is no place in Australia where greater care has been taken to. shut out coloured labour. Western Australia was the first State to pass restrictive legislation. Care is not only taken there to keep them out, .but to see that those to whom passports are issued do not sell them. Some people may ask why passports are issued, but I would point out ' that if they were not given the men would not go away, and that when they receive them there is a possibility of their not coming back. </para>

Another reason is that ships will not bring them, because they are afraid of the statutory provisions.

                        <para>- Although this matter has been brought before the House by honorable members who are generally regarded as the special representatives of labour, I desire to say that there are other honorable members who sympathize with their object, and I would urge upon the Prime Minister the desirability of giving full consideration- to'; the representations made. </para>

                        <para>- - I was very glad to hear the Minister for Defence say that whilst he was Premier of Western Australia he did all he could to keep that State white, and I hope that he will use his influence to keep the Commonwealth white, too. A week or two ago 75 Afghans were landed here, and now we have another batch of 50, and it' appears to me that there are more coloured than white people coming into the Commonwealth just now. That is not a very desirable state of things. Queensland has been called a block State, but Victoria will soon be just as black, and I am afraid that these coloured people will gradually drift into Queensland, unless we have an </para>

                            <para>- Because the local franchise would not enable the people of Queensland to express themselves previously in the same emphatic way that they have now done by returning the whole of their representatives; to the Federal Legislature as advocates of a white Australia. I would like to see the Alien Restriction Bill brought in as soon as possible, or otherwise we shall soon be' in the same position as Natal, which is overrun with coloured people, and is in such a position that the Treasurer finds it very difficult to get a sufficient amount of money to defray the cost of government. </para>

                        <para>- I have an inquiry from some members of the mercantile community connected with, the Chamber of Commerce in South Australia as to whether the Premier will make provision by which copies of the Tariff shall be available for publication in every State simultaneously, when it is once laid on the table of the House ? I think it is only reasonable, as a matter of common fairness, that the Tariff should be available to the merchants of Adelaide and other places at exactly the same moment as it is disclosed to the merchants of Melbourne. </para>
