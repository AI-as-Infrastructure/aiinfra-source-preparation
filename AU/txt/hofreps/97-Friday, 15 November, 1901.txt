                    <para>Mr.BARTON.- I bad read the cablegram referred toby the honorable member in reference to the discovery of plague-infested rats on a Messageries Maritimes steamer at Marseilles, but I had not seen the telegram from Sydney with regard to the suspected case of plague. It will be remembered that on the occasion of the outbreak of plague in that city, very drastic measures were taken by the authorities which resulted in the visitation being effectively dealt with. I have no reason to suppose that the disease has not been grappled with with equally good results in the other States. The Government do not propose to take over the departments of Quarantine and Light-houses during the present session, owing to the pressure of very important business, and to the fact that it may be necessary to legislate on or about the time of taking over these departments. I will make further inquiry into the matter, but at present my impression is that outbreaks such as have been referred to can be effectively dealt with by the health authorities of the various States. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed that strong comments have been made in the State Legislature upon the serious inconvenience to which honorable members of that Parliament are being subjected through having to meet in the Exhibition-building. Fears are apparently entertained that, owing to the State Parliament having to meet in a wooden and iron building, there will be an increase in the death-rate of members. I am sure that honorable members of this House have no desire to put the members of the State Legislature to any inconvenience. I would therefore ask the Prime Minister whether he will take early steps to enable us to arrive at a decision with regard to the site of the federal capital. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to direct the attention of the Government to the effect of their proposals upon the finances of Tasmania. The Tasmanian revenue from tobacco last year was £67,000. It is now proposed to practically increase the taxation by one-sixth, and if the increase were to produce the natural result, Tasmania ought to derive a revenue from tobacco of over £70,000. The amount would be £78,000 if the full1s. 6d. increase were added, but that is not likely to happen, and we may assume that the revenue would be increased to £75,000. The Treasurer estimates, however, that the amount which will be received in Tasmania under his proposal, will be £53,000. Consequently there appears to be a likelihood of the consumers of tobacco in Tasmania being required to contribute some £20,000 for some purpose other than that of adding to the revenue. As I have previously stated, I am prepared to consider fairly and reasonably any proposals for making proper provision with regard to existing industries, but I cannot help thinking that there is something unreasonable about a proposal of this kind. Even without taking into account the extra taxation proposed, there will be a decrease of revenue, but, with the increased rate of duty, £20,000 more will betaken from the consumers of tobacco in Tasmania, apparently f for purposes other than that of swelling the revenue. I submit this matter for the consideration of Ministers. I do not know whether it will be well for us to reduce the duty on imported tobacco, or whether we should increase the excise duty on manufactured tobacco and cigars. I think that under the present proposal we should be throwing away too much revenue, and I hope to see some modification of the duties. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened yesterday and this morning with a great deal of interest to the remarks of honorable members in connexion with this item, which is one of the most important which we have to deal with in the whole of the Tariff. "We have considered this matter from several points of view. We have viewed it from the point of revenue, and we expect to raise a very large sum - £1,000,000 - from import and excise duties on narcotics. Then we have had to consider the question from the points of view of the importers, the manufacturers, the workers, the growers, and last, but not least, of the consumers within our Commonwealth. I am quite in accord with honorable members who believe that from this class of commodity we ought to raise as much as we possibly can towards our revenue, and the only 'difficulty is to ascertain which is the best way, having in view the diverse interests to be considered. Now, I am perfectly satisfied that 'to cut down the import duty without doing anything else would not be the best way, in the interests either of the revenue, of the persons interested in the industry, or of the consumers. I think that the duty we have fixed is a fair one. It is not so large as that which has been levied in some of the States, but it is larger than the rate of duty which has prevailed in several of them. If we are to do anything at all in connexion with this matter, I think the wiser plan will be to deal with it either by an increase in the excise duty or an increase in the duty on the imported leaf, or, perhaps, by a combination of both. That is a matter which will require very serious consideration. We are proposing to put a duty on manufactured tobacco of 3s. 6d. per lb., on imported leaf of ls. 6d. per lb., and to impose an excise duty of ls. Until lately, in New South Wales, the duty was 3s. on the imported manufactured tobacco, and ls. on imported leaf, whilst the excise duty was ls. 3d. The last mentioned duty has lately been brought down to ' 9d. in order to place it on an equality with the duty prevailing in Victoria. The duty previously levied on imported manufactured tobacco in Victoria was 3s., whilst imported leaf was subject to a duty of ls., and the excise duty was 9d. In Queensland they had the very high rates of 4s. on manufactured tobacco, 2s. on imported leaf, and ls. excise. In South Australia the import duty on manufactured tobacco was 2s. 9d., and on leaf ls. 7£d. but there was no excise. In Tasmania there was an import duty of 3s. all round upon manufactured and leaf tobacco, and no excise. Tasmania was the only State that did not give a preference of some sort or other to the raw material. In Western Australia the import duty on manufactured tobacco was 3s., as against ls. 10½d on imported leaf, and there was no excise. Under these duties the manufacturer had an advantage in New South Wales of 9d. per lb. I am assuming now that only imported leaf was used. In Victoria there was an advantage of ls. 3d., in Queensland ls., in South Australia ls. l£d., and in Western Australia ls. l£d. There was no advantage given to the local manufacturer in Tasmania, and so far as my knowledge goes there is no manufacturer in that particular State. Then, as far as the grower was concerned, he had an advantage in New South Wales and Victoria of ls., Queensland 2s., in South- Australia ls. 7£d., and in Western Australia ls. 10^-d. A charge has been made against the Government that they are largely increasing the protection to the manufacturers for the purpose of giving them an advantage. I quite confess that in dealing with this matter we have to bear in mind that the manufacturer of tobacco mixes the colonial grown leaf when he can get it, probably in the proportion of one-half. In considering the advantage which he enjoys we must not overlook that very important point. I fail to see that our proposals constitute any attempt to increase the protection afforded to the local manufacturer. As a matter of fact, we are imposing a duty of 6d. per lb. extra upon the leaf, and a similar additional amount upon the manufactured tobacco. If anything, that will result in a little disadvantage to the local manufacturer. So far as 'the preference is concerned, </para>

                        <para>- My impression was that these figures applied to the tobacco industry only : but even if they apply to cigars and cigarettes, those lines can be considered later on. If we impose too high a duty on the leaf, the result will be a loss of revenue, because there will be a larger quantity of the local article grown. While, of course, we are all anxious to encourage the growth of that article, -we must endeavour to deal fairly as between the grower and the revenue which we hope to collect from this particular item. Then we have to be careful in dealing with any increase of the excise, because if we make that too high the local grower may not be able to compete with the imported leaf. Looking at this matter fairly, I think we must recognise that, whilst the manufacturers make large profits, the importers make "very large profits. I believe that if we could get a comparison of the balance-sheets of those who are importing and of those who are manufacturing tobacco, we should find that the profits made by the importers are largely in excess of those made by the manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- I have not been able to get possession of any particular balance-sheet. I should be very glad, however, to secure both those of the importers and those of the manufacturers. We must all realize that at the present time a great fight is proceeding between the importers and the manufacturers for the possession of the Australian markets. There can be no question with regard to that ; and the proposal made by the honorable member for North Sydney, if carried, would operate altogether in favour of the importers, because it would allow them to obtain their manufactured tobacco 6d. per lb. cheaper than we propose, while the excise would not be interfered with. The result would be, that they would be able to sell their tobacco at less than they could if they had to pay the increased amount in connexion with it. </para>

                        <para>- If they imported only the manufactured article, I fail to see how the question of the duty upon the manufactured leaf affects the matter at all. I can understand the duty upon the leaf having a great influence upon the home manufacturer. However, my honorable friend has had great experience, and probably maybe able to show later on that I am in error. At present, however, I think that any reduction in the amount of the import duty upon the manufactured article would result, not only in loss to the revenue, but in an undue preference being given to the importers. One honorable member, upon the other side of the House, told us last night that the object underlying this proposal is not only to reduce the import duty by 6d. per lb., but to increase the excise by a similar amount. I think the honorable member for Robertson made that statement. I know that it is a free-trade principle to have no difference between the import duty upon the manufactured article and the import duty upon the leaf and the excise, so as to avoid any preference being given to the local manufacturer. True, the honorable member for North Sydney has not attempted to go so far up to the present. But there are others who might wish to go further, and that honorable member might very reluctantly be compelled to vote with them upon a question of this kind. It is not to the advantage of the community at large that those who are manufacturing tobacco at the present time should be turned into importers, because whilst there may be a fight between the importers and the local manufacturers, it is clear that if we had only two or three large importers they might take advantage of the position and form a ring, and if there were no competition with imported tobacco by an article which was locally manufactured the consumer would have to pay a higher price for the imported article than he has to pay at the present time, or, indeed, for what I am told is a fairly good local article. </para>

                        <para>- They are entitled to a fair margin of protection, but in these and other matters I am not one who would give to the manufacturer an undue margin. I think it should be fair. We should allow fair competition between the local and the imported articles. The Government have no desire to give any more protection .to the local manufacturer than is sufficient to enable him to carry on his business at a fair profit to himself. We cannot expect manufacturers to pay reasonable rates of wages - as they ought to be compelled to do - unless we allow them a reasonable margin of profit for themselves. At the same time, we ought to be careful that we do not enable persons to take large sums from us and send them away to other countries. It has been stated that the conditions of United Australia will affect this question. No doubt they will. The manufacturers in the various States will, unless they form a ring, fight against each other. They are doing so at the present time. The Sydney manufacturer is doing his best to increase his market in Victoria, whilst the Victorians are doing all they can to increase their output in New South Wales and the other States. The difference caused by the fact that there is now a larger market available, and it is possible to manufacture a larger quantity of tobacco at a somewhat reduced cost, ought fairly to be taken into' consideration in dealing with this question.. We did take that into consideration, because we have made somewhat large reductions in Victoria, and smaller reductions in some of the other States. I was anxious to find out whether the statements made in this committee concerning the enormous profits, which are alleged to be made by manufacturers were accurate. I regret that I have been unable to satisfy myself upon that question. I have had certain information supplied to me, but that information is not such as satisfies me, nor is it of the character which ought to have been supplied to me when I asked to be informed upon this subject. I desired to ascertain from the manufacturers exactly what they are doing. Whether they are afraid to disclose the facts, I am not in a position to say. I have no knowledge of what the paid-up capital of the large manufacturing companies is, but apparently they do not divide amongst their shareholders very large dividends. They pay good dividends, but not such as would represent the enormous profits which have been mentioned. Of course, it may be that they are utilizing their surplus profits for the purpose of increasing their plant and buildings. In one venture in which I was interested the same course was pursued, but that venture was in no way connected with the tobacco industry. We simply had a small paid-up capital, and the rest of the property we bought out of our profits. </para>

                        <para>- I have asked for them, but have not been supplied with them. I have not received the information which, I think, I am entitled to receive. If I had had my way concerning the Tariff, I should have appointed the Minister for Trade and Customs with myself and, perhaps, some other Minister as a board, and should have examined importers and manufacturers alike. Then we should have been able to come down to the House with some definite information. But, unfortunately, there was a desire that the Tariff should be brought into operation at the earliest possible moment, so that we might get the benefits arising from Inter-State freetrade. Therefore, when we get further information upon the various items included in the Tariff, which -may lead us to alter the duties which we have framed, we are going to do what is right and proper, even though we may be accused of backing down. We desire to obtain the fullest information from all sources in order that we may sift it thoroughly, and bring the results obtained before the committee, so that they may deal with the various matters upon fair lines. In this connexion we must take care to protect the interests of the growers in a fair way, and also the interests of the manufacturers, because this is a well-established industry in our States. We must take care also that we compel fair competition, not only between the manufacturers, but between the manufacturers and the importers. I may here point out that New South Wales is regarded as a free-trade State, and yet whilst some of the other States have been giving a protection of1s.1d. or1s. 3d. per lb. to the local manufacturers, New South Wales has gone so far as to give a preference of 9d. per lb to the home manufacturers. The free-trade Government which was in power in that State did not remit this duty any more than they remitted the duty upon sugar. In Great Britain there was until recently a preference of 6d. per lb. given to the home manufacturers, but owing to financial reasons it has been reduced to 5d. per lb. There, the consumption of home-made tobacco amounts to83, 000, 000 lbs. annually, whilst the imported tobacco represents 3,000,000 lbs. It is quite evident, therefore, that in England the home manufacturers have practically control of the market. We know from the reports which have appeared in the press that attempts are now being made by the Americans to secure possession of the tobacco market in Great Britain. That fact should make us very careful not to take any steps which might enable the great American trust to attempt the same tiling in our market, if they considered it large enough to justify them in losing a considerable amount of money for a year or two for the purpose of killing off our local manufacturers and eventually obtaining control of the situation. If we carry out the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney and reduce the import duty from 3s. 6d. to 3s. per lb., we shall, I think, lose revenue. If we were to get the same amount of revenue that we should receive under our proposal, it necessarily follows that we must have reduced production locally - revenue must be collected on a considerably larger import if we are to get the same amount of revenue. </para>

                        <para>- A little; by some £100,000 odd, I think. So far as my information goes, the manufacture of tobacco in America is mostly conducted by black labour, and I think none of us are any more anxious to encourage that class of labour than we are to encourage the presence of coloured people within our boundaries. It is said that there are only about 2,000 people engaged in the industry in the Commonwealth, and that it would not matter if they were deprived of employment. But if we were to follow that practice in regard to other industries we should gradually extinguish the number of people who now find employment in the various States. We must not forget that many other industries are dependent on the tobacco industry, and that many persons are engaged in those industries. If. we encourage the growing of the leaf, considerable labour will be employed in both growing and curing, and people will be enabled to make a good living out of very small areas of land. That, I take it, is something we are all anxious to accomplish. </para>

If we give sufficient margin of protection there is no reason why tobacco should not be grown by white men, as it is to a considerable extent in the State of Victoria, according to the honorable member for Moira, who has some practical knowledge. </para>

If it is fair to allow a margin of 6d. in Great Britain, I think we may admit that it would not be wise as proposed to allow a margin of only 6d. in Australia. The difference in the price of coal, the charges'} for interest and in other directions, entitle our manufacturers here to further consideration than is apparently given in Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I have already mentioned that point, but the honorable member must know that the locally-grown leaf at present is not extensively used. It is largely used in Queensland, and to some extent in New South Wales, but in Victoria there is practically none used. Not very long ago some of the smaller factories in Victoria had to cease operations, and that is where, as I pointed out before, the great danger lies in dealing too drastically with this particular industry. It is true that the growing of the tobacco leaf has fallen off considerably, both in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales they still use homegrown leaf, and I can only account for that by the fact that it is leaf which has been stored, because the production is not great at the present time. But I am told by experts that at a place called Texas, in Queensland, a large amount of leaf can be produced, and one of the benefits that Queensland will derive is that she will be able to send some of that leaf to New South Wales and to Victoria. But it will be a long time before a sufficient supply is grown within the Commonwealth to seriously interfere with the imported leaf from America, for the purpose of manufacturing certain classes of tobacco, and for mixing with other leaf. . The growers have. had great difficulty in disposing of their leaf here. </para>

                        <para>- The leaf has not been so good as we hoped it would be, but I think it has been of sufficiently good quality to allow of its being used in considerable proportions with the better imported leaf. But the day will come when, with the advice which experts can give us, with regard to the different soils and the best mode of curing - that seems the difficulty - we will grow leaf fairly well in many parts of the Commonwealth. Hitherto, unfortunately, we have not been able to cure the leaf in such a manner as to enable it to compete with the imported article. It has been mentioned in Victoria that we have little of the home-grown leaf. Some five or six years ago the Government of which I was the head, in order to get extra revenue, increased the excise from 6d. to 9d., and since that step was taken the production of leaf has fallen off very largely. That warns me not to fix too high an excise, because that experience may be repeated. I am informed by a petition which has been presented by an honorable member to the Minister for Trade and Customs that a large proportion of the excise then adopted had to be paid by the growers, whose prices were so reduced that they were not able to grow at a satisfactory profit. </para>

                        <para>- A shilling is the margin in Queensland, and I think the honorable member will agree that we ought to give a reasonable amount of assistance to an industry which may fairly be looked on as natural to the country. Of course, the growers have more than ls. - they really have ls. 6d. - but the excise was raised to 9d., and the import duty on leaf was, I think, ls. Undoubtedly, in making the change, we went altogether too far. I think honorable members will be prepared to assist growers throughout the Commonwealth by providing some means of granting a small bonus to help them to make the industry profitable, and producing more leaf, which I believe would in time be the result. I admit that this means a loss of revenue, but when that loss occurs we can increase the excise, and, to a considerable proportion, recoup ourselves, besides finding employment for a number of persons in growing, curing, and manufacturing tobacco. As to the point of view of the consumer, we are told that the difference is an absolute loss to the Treasury. No doubt, if we imported everything we should be able to get a larger amount of revenue, but that is certainly not the policy we are adopting, and I believe it is not the policy which the majority of honorable members intend to adopt in connexion with this Tariff. At the same time, the consumer gets a considerable advantage from the fact that tobacco is manufactured in these States. Prices which have been furnished to me seem to show that the consumer enjoys a difference of something like ls. 8£d. per lb. in the purchase of colonial tobacco. I am no judge in regard to these figures, and simply supply them to honorable members, who can correct me if I inadvertently give information which is not actually correct. I am told by one firm that since the proposed Federal Tariff the lowest price at which colonial tobacco is sold is 2s. 3d. per lb., while the best brings 4s. 4d. per lb. Assuming the manufacturers sell about equal quantities of the two qualities, the average net selling price will be 3s. 3£d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- From Messrs. Cameron. As I say, the American tobacco is sold at 5s. per lb., showing a saving of ls. 8-|d. to the consumer, and looking at the 4,000,000 lbs. weight that is produced here, and probably sold throughout the Commonwealth, it means that the consumer saves something like £300,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>- I quite confess that if we had no duty on imported and manufactured tobacco, the consumer might probably get his supply at a less price; but the honorable member knows as well as I do that that is an utter impossibility. Tobacco is one of the articles in connexion with which we have to make up as much revenue as we possibly can. While some loss to the Treasury does take place, in consequence of encouragement to this industry - because if we imported all we should get a larger revenue - there is no doubt that the consumer does get a large benefit, and the money thus saved is probably spent on other dutiable articles. Although the Treasury necessarily loses in one direction, the people have ah extra amount of money, by the expenditure of which the loss is made up to a considerable extent. I confess frankly that I believe the margin proposed by the Government is too large. The information which has been furnished to us during the discussion, and the result of the inquiries made by myself, lead me to that conclusion. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and if' that is correct it would be ridiculous to attempt to discuss the matter with a view to making any alteration. The only other matter to which I desire to refer is the extent to which sailors will suffer under the new Tariff. We are all sympathetic with the sailors, but in this particular instance the imposition which the sailors are called upon to bear cannot be laid at the door of the Tariff. It is quite right that the Tariff should bear the blame for any faults that attach to it, but many tilings have been most unfairly laid at its door, and it certainly ought not to be discredited, owing to burdens which have been imposed by people outside, or which have been occasioned by an Act of this Parliament. This particular charge is to be made upon sailors, in consequence of what this Parliament did in passing the Customs Act. Provision was made in that Act for taxing ships' stores, and the tobacco used by sailors forms part of the ships' stores. </para>

                        <para>- The imports may be less, of course, in consequence of the greater Inter-State trade. We expect to receive from the import duty on manufactured tobacco £566,000 at 3s. 6d., and if that duty is reduced to 3s. that will be equivalent to a reduction of one-seventh. We have allowed for the fact that the excise duty will take the place of the import duty on tobacco to some extent, no matter whether the import duty is fixed at 3s. or 3s. 6d. Either we shall have to import the same quantity and get a lesser revenue at 3s., or import a larger quantity at the lower rate of taxation, and in that case a serious injury will be done to the local manufacturer. The loss to the revenue would be considerable unless we imported -more than we expect. But if we imported more it would be at the loss of the manufacturers here. I think we shall get a larger revenue by leaving the duty at 3s. 6d. than if we reduce it to 3s. If we reduce the import duty on manufactured tobacco we shall give an undue preference to the importer as against the local manufacturer, because that would leave a margin of only 6d., as between the duty that would have to be paid by the local manufacturer and the import duty, which I consider too small - for the smaller factories, at any rate. If we reduce the import duty, we should also cut down the excise duty in order to retain the same margin between the import and the excise duties. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared at present to say what we shall do. We shall certainly make a reduction in the amount of the protection, either by increasing the excise duty or the duty on the imported leaf, but we are not likely to impose a duty of 6d. more on the unmanufactured leaf, because that would be playing directly into the hands of the importers. I think an extra duty of 3d. altogether would be a fair thing, but whether that should be added to the excise duty, or divided between the import duty on the unmanufactured leaf and the excise duty I am not prepared to say at the moment. I have not had an opportunity of inquiring into this matter, and I will not pledge myself to do one thing or the other, but we think that1s. margin is too much, and that the manufacturers ought to be satisfied and able to work profitably on a margin of 9d. When we come to deal with the excise, we shall have an opportunity of considering that matter, and I again invite honorable members to give me any information they may have. Further than that I am not prepared to go at the present. I would ask the honorable member for North Sydney not to persist in his amendment, for the reasons I have urged. I think he will admit that I am trying to meet his views fairly in saying that I will make a reduction to the extent I have named in the protection given to our manufacturers. I think that we shall derive £40,000 or £50,000 more from the additional 3d. duty now suggested by us, and, as far as the financial information enables me to judge, I do not think we shall' seriously injure the larger manufacturers. The smaller manufacturers, although they will not have perhaps as much protection as I should like, will still be able to carry on. I should be very sorry to close up any of these factories, but there is a great difficulty in dealing fairly as between the smaller and the larger manufactories. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Treasurer has taken the right course in agreeing to make some alterations in the proposals as far as their protective incidence is concerned. It has been shown in one State at least, under the excise and import duties existing there, that tobacco manufacturers have made a very considerable success of their business. I think it will be agreed that it is not necessary to extend any further concessions than have been enjoyed in that particular State in the past. The 9d. margin that has been enjoyed by the manufacturer in New South Wales is somewhat misleading, because we know that in that State they use, on an average, at least one-half of local leaf in the manufacture of tobacco, leaving cigars out. This leaf bears no excise, and consequently increases the margin which the manufacturers have to work upon. I should like the Treasurer to give us some figures as to the effect upon the various States' revenues of the change in the duty. Four out of the six States have imposed a duty of 3s. per lb. upon imported manufactured tobacco for some years past, and the information I have shows that the revenue under a 3s. duty has been steadily declining, although the population has increased in each of the States. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It is important for us to know what the effect of the 3s. duty has been, so that we may properly consider the probable consequences of raising the duty to 3s. 6d. per lb. In view of the decrease that has taken place in the importation of manufactured tobacco and the increase in the importation of unmanufactured leaf, the question is whether, if we increase the duty on manufactured tobacco to 3s. 6d., we shall not lead to a still further reduction in the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- In any case it seems difficult to come to a decision as to the revenue-reducing probabilities of the 3s. 6d. duty unless we have figures before us showing what has been going on in the past. I am rather inclined to think that the effect of increasing the duty to 3s. 6d. will be to reduce the revenue. So far as Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia, and to a limited extent Victoria are concerned, it is clear that under federation the greater part of the colonial leaf used will be furnished by Queensland and New South Wales, Climatic conditions in these two latter States will make for the growth of tobacco, as long as there is any margin of profit. </para>

                        <para>- So far as leaf is concerned, I do not think it necessary to provide for the enormous protection that exists in some of the States - or that existed in New South Wales some years ago. I believe that tobacco leaf has been selling in New South Wales lately at something like 3½d to 4d. per lb., and if we cannot grow tobacco in competition with imported leaf that bears a duty of ls., it is clear that the industry is not suitable to the country. This consideration is altogether outside the question whether it is reasonable to expect the community generally to pay so much more for their tobacco, or to expect the Treasurer to stand the loss of revenue to the extent that is asked for by those interested. If the colonial leaf is safeguarded to the extent of 6d. per lb., it will have all the protection necessary. At present the duty proposed is about six times the price of the imported leaf. The tobacco growing industry in New South Wales is in the hands of Chinese at the present time, and they do not produce a leaf which can 21 sr compare with the American leaf. In Queensland, where climatic conditions are more favorable, they may do better than in New South Wales, but it is useless to expect that the high protective duties will cause the smokers of Australia to patronize the colonial leaf unless it is mixed with the higher quality article imported from America. It has been argued that if the excise duty were raised to the same rate as the import duties, we should derive much more revenue, but I do not think that follows, because the locally manufactured tobacco is sold at much lower prices than the imported article. I have received from the honorable member for Cowper a statement which gives two price lists - one before the duty, and the other since - from one of the principal houses in Sydney. That shows that whilst American tobacco before the imposition of the federal duty sold at from is. 9d. to 5s. 6d. per lb.,, the colonial tobacco containing approximately half imported leaf and half of" colonial, sold at from 3s. 4d. to 4s.. Id. per lb. Since then, in consequence of the increased duty upon the imported leaf, there has been an all-round increase of 6d. per lb. upon imported tobacco, and an advance in the price of colonial tobacco of from 2d. to 6d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. Opportunity has been, taken by the manufacturers . to obtain the extra duty upon stocks which, had accumulated. So far as the recent reduction of the excise duty in New South. Wales is concerned, I wish to point out. that that reduction did not benefit the consumers. The whole of the money represented by that remission of duty found its way into the pockets of." the local manufacturer. But I wish* to call attention to the fact that owing to the locally manufactured tobacco being sold at the cheaper rate, the American article will not be consumed to such a large extent if the customs duty upon it is increased. It seems to me that the people who now buy tobacco at 3s. 4d. per lb. are not likely to pay an increased price of 5s. 6d. to the same extent as they do. now. </para>

                        <para>- I am willing if it can be demonstrated that we shall get more revenue from it to keep the duty at 3s. 6d. per pound, and at the same time to increase the excise so as to leave only a fair margin between the two. But I am very doubtful whether 3s. 6d. per lb. will produce more revenue than has been derived in the past. I should be very glad if we could obtain the results of the operation of the duties which have prevailed in the various States during the past few years. </para>

                        <para>- In any case the revenue there has not suffered, and all round the experiment has been a great success. At the same time, I quite coincide with the Treasurer's statement that this is such an important proposal that it requires careful consideration before we commit ourselves to it. Therefore whilst sympathizing with the amendment, and inclined to vote for it, I would suggest to the honorable member the propriety of withdrawing it at the present stage with a view to allowing honorable members, free from all fiscal or other considerations, to discuss it upon its merits on some future occasion. I think we should be acting most unwisely if we allowed the great margin of protection to the manufacturer which was originally proposed by the Government to continue. A number of manufacturers have done excellently under the arrangement which has existed in New South Wales, and any better arrangement can only be made by neglecting an opportunity for raising revenue from an item which may be fairly regarded as one which should contribute to the Treasury in times of stress and difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that it was rubbish ; but if the honorable member will talk rubbish I am not responsible for it. I would point out that the manufacfacturers of South Australia, West Australia and Victoria have hitherto had from l1/2d. up to 3d. per lb. greater advantage than it was proposed to confer upon them under the printed Tariff. Now, however, they are to be put to a still greater disadvantage. I am pretty confident that the result of the Government proposals, if adopted, will be that in the smaller States the tobacco-making industry will cease, or else all round an inferior local article will be produced. Up to the present, with the difference which has existed, the various States have been able to turn out a high-class twist tobacco which has been slowly but surely beating the imported article out of the market. The result of adopting the Government proposal, however, will be, that instead of getting a high-class light or dark twist tobacco, we shall get nothing but plug tobacco, which consists, it is said, of the "short ends," and sometimes the sweepings of the floor. The result will certainly not be to the advantage of the users of colonial tobacco. We shall get an inferior article. I am surprised that the Government have given way at once to the suggestion which emanated from the other side of the House, that the difference in favour of the local manufacturer was too high. The only reason which the Treasurer gave for the alteration was that he had unsuccessfully endeavoured to obtain information as to what profits had been made by the manufacturers. That, however, is not a sufficient reason for inducing this committee to handicap the industry in the way proposed. Had the Treasurer urged that there was no protection for the workmen engaged in the industry, he would have been putting the case very much more strongly from my point of view. </para>

                        <para>- Nothing of the sort. I am giving it to the industry. The honorable member is talking nonsense when he says that I am giving it to the employer. The protection in favour of local industries is a protection to the workman as well as to the manufacturer. In order to make the thing complete, I admit that it is necessary we should have some tribunal which will prevent those who have the opportunity from securing the whole advantage, and which will compel them to divide it with the operatives. I claim that it is possible to place this industry under such conditions that it can afford to pay good wages to the men engaged in it. One of the objects of protection is to pay good wages to the workmen. I feel certain that part of the difference which the Government proposes, and perhaps the greater part, will come out of the pockets of the men who do the work, and the other part out of the pockets of the public in the shape of an inferior local article. I do not think there is much cause for complaint against tobacco manufacturers, as compared with other manufacturers, in connexion with the treatment of their employes. No doubt large fortunes have been made in the tobacco industry, and the way to prevent that is to have some control of the wages in the various States. </para>

                        <para>- There was a difference of only 100,000 odd lbs. between 1899 and 1900, and there was a steady increase in production from 1897 to 1900 amounting to 306,000 lbs. This shows that the local industry was gaining on the imported article under a margin of 9d. per lb. It has been said that by a reduction of the import duty we shall lose revenue, and the Treasurer has asked me not to press my amendment. We have mutually come to the conclusion that a difference of 9d. is sufficient, and there are different ways of arriving at that margin. I admit that a lot of consideration is required as to which method is most advantageous from a revenue stand-point, and the question is - What adjustment will yield the best revenue? I would suggest that the Treasurer should not push this item to a division now, but should take the whole matter into consideration, and obtain information which will enable him to form a conclusion. We could leave the 3s. 6d. as it is, increasing the duty on the imported leaf by 3d. ; or there is another way, of leaving the import duty as it is, and increasing the excise by 3d. I think the Treasurer would find that the New South Wales method would perhaps yield the largest revenue, namely - 3s. on imports, ls. on the leaf, and ls. 3d. excise. </para>

                        <para>- There are a great many considerations, which show that 3s. and1s. 3d. will yield the best revenue and prevent the necessity of increasing the cost to the user. The Treasurer, when he has promised to consider the excise, and when the import duty is so bound up with the excise, should consider the whole question, or I must allow my amendment to stand. </para>

                        <para>- In that case' I shall have to go to a vote. It has been indicated that the increase of excise may have something to do with the lower production of the leaf; but if the advantage of1s. is left to the growers, it is a very large one. Pretty good tobacco is sold for less than1s. per lb. in the leaf, and it is proposed to leave the whole cost of a pound of tobacco as an advantage to the Australian grower. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports contends that the imposition of duties does not increase prices, and yet he now says that a non-increase of an import duty will increase the price. If 3s. has been the import duty, and the 3s. is continued, there is no doubt the consumer will get his tobacco at the old price; and, under the circumstances, I favour the old import rate. As to leaf,1s. is ample margin for the Australian grower, and the reason that leaf has not been produced to the same extent as some years ago is found in the low prices obtained for it. The low price given for locally grown tobacco leaf has not been due to a ring of manufacturers, but to the inferior quality of the article. I know that the Agricultural department in New South Wales tested the London market with some of the Australian grown leaf, and received a very low price for it, as it was described as almost useless. The defect in the quality of the leaf has been due to the choice of the wrong soil or the wrong locality, or to want of knowledge in connexion with the curing. That has been the trouble, but as the Treasurer has already pointed out, we may look forward in the future to a larger production of Australian leaf, owing to the steps that are being taken to select suitable localities for its production, and to properly cure it, in order to make it fit for use by manufacturers. The Treasurer has stated that he fears American trusts, but I do not think that should influence him, because American trusts can work from inside as well as outside. Are there no American trusts interested in tobacco manufacture in these States already? Does the Treasurer not know that the American tobacco trusts propose to attack the English markets from within, and not from without ? So that if we give an undue advantage to manufacturers within the Commonwealth, we are not necessarily safeguarding the Australian manufacturers, because the American trusts may avail themselves of the facilities that are offered here for exploiting the public. The margin of 9d. between the import and the excise duties has been shown to be amply sufficient to maintain the tobacco manufacturing industry in Australia, and if the American trusts have any designs upon our trade, they will probably come here and fight our manufacturers on their own ground. The Treasurer has practically admitted that if we provide for a margin of 9d., there will be no danger from American trusts from outside. </para>

If honorable members are not consistent in their policy with reference to the products of cheap labour, their cry of a white Australia is so much political claptrap. The honorable members of the Opposition have expressed their intention to support the sugar duties in order that white labour may be employed in the cane fields, and, in order to be consistent, they should support the tobacco duties, so as to encourage the employment of white labour in the production of tobacco leaf. Texas is away in the mountains, and has one of the coolest and most bracing climates in Australia, and we not only have the assurance of the tobacco-growers that white labour can be successfully employed in tobacco culture, but we know as a matter of fact that white labour is employed. I hope honorable members on the opposite side will endeavour to be consistent, and true to the policy of maintaining a white Australia. </para>

                    <para>In New South Wales there lias been an increase of 260 per cent, on importations of unmanufactured tobacco, while there is only an increase of 20 per cent, on the locally grown, showing the increased consumption is almost wholly supplied by imported tobacco ; while the local manufacturers are constantly increasing their output from imports, as shown by the imports of manufactured tobacco having decreased 8 2-3rds per cent. only. Victoria shows a similar condition, but not so bad. There is an increase of 144 per cent, in imported unmanufactured, and a decrease of 13 per cent, in imported manufactured. Queensland shows a very different state of things. In the six (6) years, imports of unmanufactured tobacco have fallen off 91^ per cent. , and the use of Queensland grown tobacco increased 338 per cent. ; and while the year 1899 shows 37 per cent, of all tobacco consumed was Queensland-grown, the three (3) preceding years (1896-7-8) show it was 40 per cent. ; and in 1900 the consumption was as follows : - Manufactured imported, 690,634 lbs. ; unmanufactured do., 62,020 lbs. - 752,654 lbs. Queensland-grown tobacco, 615,401 lbs., or 45 per cent, of the whole. </para>

                        <para>- The Tariff has excluded, to a very great extent, the negro grown tobacco of America. Both Queensland and America are adapted for the growing of tobacco, but the conditions of competition are not equal, owing to the cheap labour available in America, and we are only following natural laws when we attempt to make conditions more equal by imposing import duties. If we are to encourage our farmers, we must discourage the importation of tobacco as far as possible. There are large tracts of land suitable for tobacco culture in New South Wales, on the border, close to the Queensland tobacco-growing country, but no steps have been taken to utilize it. I believe that if proper encouragement were given, the whole of this large area to which I refer would be occupied for the cultivation of tobacco. </para>

                        <para>- I am asking honorable members to give to employers such encouragement as will enable them to pay good wages to their labourers. I ask the Treasurer not to alter the relation which exists between the excise and the import duty proposed, because we ought to bear in mind that the American unmanufactured leaf is imported, stemmed, sorted, thoroughly dried, and ready for immediate use by the manufacturer. That gives the imported leaf a great advantage. The whole of the work done in the preparation of that leaf is performed by negro labour, which represents a difference of quite 3d. per lb. If we wished to make a real difference of1s. per lb. in favour of the home grower, we would have to make the duty1s. 3d. per lb., in order to allow for the cheap labour of the United States. I do not desire to take up the time of the committee any further, but I urge, on behalf of what is becoming a great industry in Queensland, that we should not alter the relation between the excise and the import duty proposed, and that we should give all the encouragement which is possible to the primary producers. </para>

                        <para>- I have always seen tobacco cultivated successfully upon very good soil. To grow the leaf successfully it should be grown upon good soil, and it should be very carefully cultivated. If there is one thing more than another that we should endeavour to encourage it is intense cultivation - a system of cultivation that will lead to the establishment of peasant proprietors upon the soil of the country. If we look at the history of the world we shall find that those countries are most prosperous which have the largest proportion of their people settled upon the soil. This peasant proprietorship produces a spirit of independence which it is desirable to foster. Whilst labouring for the advancement of their own private interests, these people are advancing the general good </para>

                        <para>- It must be a great wrench to the honorable member's principles to support any local industry. When a person openly avows that he honestly entertains the belief that the interests of the workers are best served by depriving them of work - which we certainly do when we send our orders abroad - and that the country is the most prosperous which pays the bulk of its expenditure to foreign nations, it must be very difficult for him to support any measure that is calculated to establish a local industry. -The honorable member for Parramatta laid great stress on the point that the tobacco manufacturers were making unduly large profits. I have no sympathy with either a manufacturer or an importer who is deriving an undue proportion of the profits of the trade in which he is engaged. That may be an excellent argument in favour of enacting legislation which will lead to the equitable distribution of the profits amongst all the persons engaged in this industry - amongst the shareholders, The primary producers, the farmers, who grow the leaf, and the workers who convert it into the finished article of commerce. </para>

                        <para>- I am advocating an equitable distribution of the profits of an industry amongst all engaged in that industry. That, however, cannot be secured by importing our goods from abroad. I cannot, for the life of me, see how our people can be benefited by the orders which we send to other countries. I think every protectionist admits that an interchange of products amongst nations is essential, and should not be dispensed with. I think also that we should give every possible facility for the interchange of those commodities which cannot be produced to advantage locally, and there will always be a large number of these. But that is no argument in favour of refusing to encourage the establishment of industries which can be successfully opened up in our own midst, and which are calculated to give employment to our own people. </para>

                        <para>- Then to that extent we can all agree. I would like to give the manufacturer the whole of the advantage the Government originally proposed, because, as a reduction on what they have already received, it cannot be considered too much. Whatever may be done eventually in that direction, I hope every honorable member will see that the grower of the local leaf is not in any way prejudiced by alterations of the Tariff. I rose merely to say a few words in the interests of the primary producer, to safeguard whom it is necessary to safeguard the manufacturer. I hope honorable members will dismiss from their minds any arguments based on the large profits which are said to be made in the industry, to the value of which these profits bear most eloquent testimony, provided they are equitably distributed. It is in the direction of the proper distribution of profits that honorable members who make complaints on this score, should seek to legislate in the future. It ought to be remembered that imported tobacco produces large profits to manufacturers in other countries. Is there any reason why we should encourage large profits elsewhere, and discourage them in our own country ? We ought not to drive a valuable industry away, because we find that it pays handsome dividends to shareholders. I am not at all opposed to this industry being made a Government monopoly, but I think it is only prejudicing the case for the industry to press forward a proposal of the kind without proper information. Even those who feel favourably disposed to a proposition of the kind on its merits will, after proper investigation, be compelled to vote against it, whereas it might have a favourable reception if brought forward at the proper time. The advantages of settling a peasant proprietary on the public lands can be seen in France. In the valley of the Seine, families are settled on three, four, or five acres, and factories are thick as blackberries there to work up the raw materials. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very high percentage. It was the peasant proprietary that enabled France to pay the enormous indemnity levied by Germany, and who caused Bismarck to say, a few years later, that France was richer after paying that indemnity than Germany was after receiving it. It is those people who always come to the rescue of the Government when France is in want of money ;. and a similar condition of affairs may be seen in Belgium, or wherever a large proportion of the people are settled on the land. The way to secure progress is to encourage settlement by legislation whenever opportunity offers. The tobacco industry presents one way in which we can profitably settle a very considerable number of families on the soil of the country, and I do not think we shall refuse to avail ourselves of the opportunity. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened with a good deal of interest to the honorable member for Gippsland, who takes a deep interest in agriculture, and with whose remarks I sympathize, more especially when he deprecates the absence of speeches on the Government side of the House, which he fears may result in no good to this industry. While honorable members on the Government side have blamed the Opposition for taking up a good deal of time in speaking on the various items under discussion, the honorable member admits that good results have followed our advocacy, important concessions having been made, though he fears that these concessions have come about because honorable members behind the Government have abstained from speaking. I give way to no one in my desire to help great industries, as I have shown in many directions during my political career. We all regret the comparative failure of the tobacco industry in the various States, although that failure has not been brought about because important advantages have not been granted, more especially in Victoria, In that State, there has been a protection of1s. per lb. on the leaf, and, in addition, I find from papers which have been submitted to the Federal Government, that the latter have sanctioned the payment by the State Government of a bonus of 3d. per lb. on exported locally grown leaf. </para>

                        <para>- When the Federal Constitution Bill was under discussion, I took strong objection to the power being given to one State Government to continue a system of bonuses for a certain time, which would, of course, work to the detriment of producers in other States. In Victoria I find that in August last there was paid as a bonus of 3d. per lb. on tobacco grown and exported to such foreign port or ports outside the Australian colonies as were approved by the Minister, the following sums: - H. Hyam, £418 13s. 5d. ; A. McAliece £48 Os. Id.; A. Byrne, £128 2s. 5d. ; and T. D. Smith, £136 13s. Sd. This bonus of 3d. per lb. has been paid since 1898. The Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to a question some weeks ago, produced a return showing the amount of bonuses which the Federal Government had sanctioned for payment by the State Government. </para>

                        <para>- The tobacco growing industry, so far from having progressed, seems to have been going back in Victoria. From the returns furnished by the Customs department, the quantity of locally-grown leaf used in tobacco manufacture last year was only 120,263 lbs. That does not represent the amount of leaf produced, but the quantity which was utilised in the manufacture of tobacco. In New South Wales, 996,998 lbs. of locally grown leaf was used for manufacturing purposes. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the Victorian growers had the advantage of a bonus, New South Wales leaf has been utilised to a very much greater extent than Victorian leaf. </para>

                        <para>- I should have liked to see it postponed indefinitely, but as it is now before us it is our duty to do the best we can to make it acceptable to the people. I have received a considerable amount of information upon this tobacco duty question from the points of view of the manufacturer, the importer, and the producer, but I do not wish to unduly delay the Committee. My principal object in speaking was to show that the attempt to protect the tobacco-growing industry has not been effective. I am told - I do not know how far it is true - that a large amount of the tobacco leaf exported from Victoria, upon which the State Government has paid a bonus of 3d. per lb., which is about the value of the article in this State, is now stored in London. This is a matter which should be enquired into before we sanction any more bonuses to exporters. I think it is unfair to the other States that the producers in Victoria should be able to obtain a bonus equal to the value of the tobacco leaf itself. In New South Wales we have never asked for any bonus upon locally grown leaf. </para>

                        <para>- I believe they are going further than that. Notwithstanding the fact that large sums of money might have been voted in 1898 for the purposes of paying bonuses to people engaged in various industries, neither the State Government nor the Federal Government have any right to enter into new contracts, even although the new contracts might not involve any appropriations of money beyond the votes already sanctioned by the State Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It all depends upon what my honorable friend would call a definite contract. Supposing £18,000 had been granted by the State Parliament, in 1 8 9 8, for the payment of a bonus on contracts entered into before the 1st January of 3d. per lb. on exported tobacco leaf, and only £2,000 had been expended in that way, and some other exporters made application during the present year for the payment of the bonus - would the honorable member consider the payment of the bonus equivalent to entering into a new contract ? </para>

                        <para>- There is apparently a distinction in the honorable member's mind between amounts voted in a general way and new contracts. When I spoke about this bonus question in New South Wales, I was told that the bonuses could only be continued where specific contracts had been made with individuals. I can assure my honorable friend that that is the way in which it was criticised and spoken of in my own State. When I pointed out the danger, those opposed to me condemned my action, and said that it referred only to contracts which had been entered into with individuals at the date mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- That may be. The simple position is that no official administrative interpretation has as yet been placed upon the latter part of the clause, but all payments that have been sanctioned have been earned prior to the imposition of uniform duties of Customs - in other words prior to the 8th October last. Only within the last 4S horn's a somewhat doubtful case arose, and before permitting the payment by the State I satisfied myself that the amount was in respect of something altogether anterior to the 8th October. </para>

                        <para>- If there were, I should not inform the honorable member of it. Upon the subject of tobacco generally, I venture to think that, as regards its growth, there is a very considerable future for it in Australia. It is an industry which is well worth encouraging. I think, as regards industries which are native to our soil and climate, we should do all that we can to encourage them. I notice that honorable members on the other side of the House congratulate themselves upon their policy in this, that, and the other respect, and I suppose in regard to the encouragement of the tobacco industry. But I should like to tell them that as far as New South Wales is concerned, fourteen years ago the product of that State was something between 50,000 and 60,000 cwt., whilst today it is not 6,000 cwt. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to favour the committee with a scientific opinion upon a subject of which I am practically ignorant. I do not indulge in the habit of smoking myself, but at the same time I recognise - and never more than at the present moment - that there is much to be said in its favour, particularly from a Customs point of view. I hope we shall not, as the result of our deliberations, adopt anything which will work injuriously either to the local manufacturer or to the growth of the article. Something has been said about trusts. It has been well put that trusts very often operate to the entire prejudice of the community. Attempts have been made to grapple with them in different ways at different times. I note with interest that in the last Canadian Act dealing with the Tariff, provision has been made by which, when a trust is suspected to exist, there is power on the part of the Executive to appoint a Judge to report as to the matter of fact. If, upon his report, it is shown that the trust's operations are to the detriment of the consumer or the community, the Executive have power to reduce the protective duty in a way which will admit of competition, and which may have the effect of limiting the prejudicial operations of the trust in question. Considerations of matters of this sort are undoubtedly forced upon us in times like these on account of the growth of trusts. Whether or not we shall be able to propose for the acceptance of the House a provision on the lines adopted in Canada, dealing with that which undoubtedly now and then grows into a great evil, I do not know. But I think it is just as well at this moment to call attention to the fact that the great federation of Canada has done something in this direction, and probably honorable members will come to the conclusion that the subject has not been overlooked by the present Government, and that if they can see a way of legislating advantageously in regard to it they will be happy to do so. </para>

                    <para>- A great deal of this debate, which I think has wandered into the general question of free-trade and protection, has exhibited the usual amount of that nonsense - I know of no other word to express it - which is talked in regard to various matters. Tobacco cultivation is one of those industries which depends upon two things. It depends upon a proper soil and climate, and upon careful manipulation with scientific knowledge. One can go into numberless regions in Australia, and plant wheat or maize and watch it grow. It does not require any particular attention. But the growing of tobacco and the treatment of it afterwards, which is the principal thing, requires most careful attention. It requires extreme patience, care, and manipulation which, unfortunately, in the Australian States is very often refused to the primary products. What is the use of our comparing the different States with one another, if Victoria has been fool enough to try and force the growth of a product which is not congenial to its climate? If by bonuses or other means it has forced this industry into prominence during some years, nature must assert herself and there must be retrogression. The enormously reduced production in Victorian only proves the absolute folly of it, and refutes the arguments of the honorable member for Gippsland and others who have talked in their wild way about helping the primary industries. We might as well say that we should try to grow cane-sugar in the Western district of Victoria, where we now grow potatoes. I am very sorry that so much of the free-trade and protectionist controversy has been imported into this part of the Tariff debate. We are not endeavouring now to put the native grown article into exactly the same position as the imported article, but are simply trying to get a reasonable compromise. </para>

                        <para>- We do not like "protection," and we would not have anything to do with it if we had our way. We want to see whether we can get a reasonable compromise, fair to the revenue, and fair to the particular conditions of this product. It is idiotic to talk about a duty of1s. 6d. on an unmanufactured product which is worth only 3d. or 4d. per lb. We recognise the fact that in dealing with the Government, or with honorable members who are restrictionists, we must make some allowance for idiotic ideas. What I mean is that there may be a principle in protection, but there is no principle in a protection of1s. 6d. on an article sold at about 4d. per lb. I could understand a protection of 6d. or 4d., but when the higher figure is mentioned, the absurdity of it is obvious. I think it would be better for us to come back to the question with which we have to deal. On the question of bonuses, I would call attention to the following section in the Constitution - </para>

                        <para>- This is a question so difficult that probably the Cabinet have not been able to decide it. It does not follow, for instance, that because a public declaration be made, or a resolution of Parliament passed, that bounties shall be given, there would be a breach of public faith if the bounties were not given for a certain period. They can be stopped at any moment ; and the Government, although the funds are not paid out of the pocket of the Commonwealth, ought to be very careful, in dealing with this question, that they do not contravene the spirit of the Constitution. Notwithstanding what the Minister for Trade and Customs says about the independence of the Executive, it would only be reasonable if, before any of these bounties were paid, information regarding them were placed on the table of the House. Bonuses are a matter which the Government ought to very carefully consider in view of our federation. The moment we were federated, the Government became trustees for the whole of the Commonwealth, and they know that these bonuses have not been in vogue in the other States. Federation, or, at any rate, the establishing of a uniform Tariff, implies absolute equality throughout the States, and it is the bounden duty of the Government not to allow a single 6d. of bonus to be given unless it is clearly proved that there otherwise would be an infringement of justice in the States. In the present state of our want of knowledge, we cannot say anything more on the subject. I understand the Government have agreed that there shall be a maximum difference of 9d. between the imported article, plus of course the manufacture, and the unmanufactured article, plus the excise. In other words, if the imported duty is reduced to 3s. and the unmanufactured duty be1s. 6d., and the excise 9d., or 2s. 3d., that would mean 9d. in favour of the locally grown article. </para>

                        <para>- What I said was that I had come to the conclusion that the manufacturers have too large a difference in their favour, and I propose to reduce the 1s. by 3d., leaving them a difference of 9d. I said that I must insist upon having an import duty of 3s. 6d. because I believed that would give us an increase of revenue. I reserve to myself the right of further consideration as to how I shall deal with the 3d. I said I might deal with it by putting the extra amount on the manufactured leaf, or on the excise, or by making a division of 2d. on the leaf and1d. on the excise. Some provision of that kind might be made, but I never contemplated, or said I proposed, to reduce the duty to 3s. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer knows that in all matters of taxation there is a reasonable price, which, if it be exceeded, does not result in encouraging revenue. It is no argument to say that we lose revenue by reducing taxation to the normal price, because when we get beyond that normal price, which is a matter of consideration and experience, a reduction encourages production, and is bound to increase the revenue. I am perfectly satisfied that in connexion with this industry, it would be far better as a matter of finance and production to keep the duty within a reasonable limit. </para>

                    <para>- The question has been asked as to whether rich land is required for tobacco cultivation. I know hundred of acres of the richest land in Australia on the Darling Downs, which has gone out of cultivation simply because the tobacco grown, although some of the best looking in Queensland, was not a good commercial commodity. There is a small district called Texas in Queensland, which is very suitable for The growth of tobacco, just as there are certain districts in the United States of America more suitable than others for the industry; and I believe that the time will come when the Texas tobacco will make a name for itself. So far as I have followed the debate it seems to me that the desire has been to protect the manufacturer rather than the producer, though, if my researches have resulted in anything, it is in the discovery that there are more people engaged in the production than there are in the manufacture of the leaf. It has been asserted, -with a good deal of emphasis, that the manufactured tobacco of America is the product of negro labour; but it must be remembered that the leaf imported is also the product of that labour. We can grow tobacco in Queensland, and the cultivation requires far more care than does an ordinary crop, owing to insect pests and other causes. But even when the best is done, it is essential that there should be certain constituents in the soil in order to produce tobacco fit for people to smoke. I nave been a smoker for over 30 years and I have never yet found a colonial tobacco which I could use. I do not say that good tobacco will never be produced in Australia, but we have not arrived at that point yet. Speaking of Queensland, I can say that the consumption of imported leaf has gone down to 34,000 lbs. The night before the poll was taken in -connexion with the federal elections I addressed a large meeting at Ipswich, and I was asked what I intended to do with regard to the tobacco duties. I stated then that I thought the duty was far too heavy, and that the difference between the duties on the imported tobacco and the locally manufactured article was far too great. The audience, which consisted of fully 1,000 people, loudly cheered my remarks. I know that the smokers of Queensland want good tobacco, and the reason the local leaf has taken such a hold upon the market is that Queensland produces tobacco superior to that grown in the other States. If we are going in for protection we should first endeavour to protect the man who is tilling the soil. It is said that our greatest national asset is our land, but our land is useless unless labour is applied to it. The duties now proposed will have the same result as was brought about in Queensland under the previous Tariff. While the consumption of local leaf has been decreasing, the consumption of the imported leaf has been growing by leaps and bounds in all the States, except Queensland. I have a statement here showing how matters stand in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales the quantity of manufactured tobacco imported in 1897 was 924,707 lbs., whereas in 1900 the imports had fallen to 858,053 lbs., or a decrease of 66,654 lbs. This deficiency was made up, not by using locally grown leaf, but by sending for the leaf grown by the negro labour of America. The imported leaf used in the local manufacture of tobacco increased from 683,928 lbs. in 1897 to 1,181,668 lbs. in 1900, whilst the quantity of local leaf used declined from 1 , 1 88, 808 lbs. in 1897 to 996,988 lbs. in 1900. The difference in the duties has not been sufficient to stimulate the production of the leaf in the State itself. In Victoria the figures are still more striking. In 1897 the manufactured tobacco imported amounted to 988,113 lbs., and in 1900 the importations had fallen to 745,027 lbs. The deficiency in this case was not made up by the use of locally grown leaf, but by the utilization of imported leaf, because the imports of leaf tobacco increased from 640,433 lbs. in 1897 to 1,328,77 lbs. in 1900, whilst the quantity of locally grown leaf utilised, decreased from 406,315 lbs. in 1897 to 120,253 lbs. in 1900. The duty in this case also failed to stimulate the primary producer, but the result has been to largely enrich a few manufacturers whose employes have not benefited to any great extent. I am sure that the difference between the cost of making a pound of tobacco in America and manufacturing a similar quantity in Australia does not amount to more than three halfpence, and against that freight and insurance charges have to be taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Very little, I admit, but leaving that out of consideration altogether, there would still be a margin of 4Jd. per lb. in favour of the local manufacturer if there were 6d. difference between the duties levied upon the imported and the locally made articles. That I think would be a sufficient margin. The figures quoted by the honorable member for Parramatta in reference to a certain tobacco manufacturer in Victoria were quite correct. The capital employed in the business was £35,000 in cash, but the shares were watered, up to £50,000, and for the last half-year the shareholders received dividends amounting to £40,000. Under these circumstances, I think that we might very well reduce the difference between the duties levied upon the imported tobacco and that locally manufactured, and still permit the manufacturers to make a profit, and pay their employes good wages. The effect which these duties will have upon the revenue is a matter of concern to the Treasurer, and I quite agree with the last speaker, that when taxation is so reduced as to bring articles within the reach of the great mass of the people, a larger revenue will be derived than if high duties are imposed. I believe that if the import duty on manufactured tobacco were reduced to 3s. per lb. a larger revenue would be derived in Queensland than from the 4s. rate, which has hitherto been levied there. The high duty has placed imported tobacco beyond the reach of men in receipt of a low wage ; but if the price were reduced by ls., very many people, who have been buying colonial tobacco, would purchase the imported article, and thus swell the revenue. I shall give my vote in the direction of reducing the difference between the duties on the locally manufactured and the imported article. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs to the statement which appears in to-day's newspapers in reference to what they term the Christmas adjournment of Parliament. It is stated that honorable members representing South Australia are distinctly opposed to a six weeks' adjournment, and favour a recess extending over only a fortnight, whereas the representatives of Western Australia desire that the House shall be adjourned for six weeks, so as to enable them to get home for Christmas. So far as I know, no honorable members on this side of the House have approached the Government, or suggested that there should be only a fortnight's adjournment. It is suggested that the Government are going to consider this matter on Tuesday next, and I desire to intimate that, so far as I know, honorable members are not opposed to such an adjournment as will enable the representatives from Western Australia to go home at least once during this session. </para>

The prospect of having to sit here for several months longer is not a pleasant one, and I hope it will be possible for the leaders on both sides, to come to some arrangement which will not only meet the convenience of members, but facilitate the passing of the very important legislation before us. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General what the position is in regard to cable matters. I should like to know whether the Ministry have come to any final decision upon the question of cable communication. From time to time reports are published in the newspapers to the effect that the Government have found out this, that, and the other with regard to the agreement with the Eastern Extension Company, and it appears to me that after twelve months, the Government ought to be able to make up their mind as to what they are going to do. This is a pressing matter, as it seems that the American people are getting ahead of us in the Pacific, and that unless we move very soon, the position will be rendered very difficult for us. I would ask if the Government have arrived at any decision, and if so, what it is. I also wish to know whether it is true that the Postmaster-General of New South Wales has actually made an agreement which cannot be terminated except by mutual consent. If that is true, the position of affairs is most extraordinary, notwithstanding the explanation offered by the Postmaster-General of New South Wales. In my opinion, his statement is no explanation. </para>

                            <para>- That will doubtless be done. If Parliament adjourns for five or six weeks, we shall probably have to commence a session in the middle of next autumn, and that would mean a continuous sitting throughout next year. However, the matter has not been discussed by the Government, but it will probably be dealt with next week. With regard to the question raised by the honorable member for Parramatta, an agreement has been entered into between the State of New South Wales and the Eastern Extension Company, and that is a binding agreement. But the Government have not dealt finally with the question of the Pacific cable. They have merely decided to assist in every possible way in carrying the project to a successful issue. It is impossible to say at present how long the agreement which has been made with the Eastern Extension Company will continue. But it is a binding agreement, and; will have to be dealt with as such. With reference to the question raised by the honorable member for Coolgardie, I understand that the document which he holds in his hand is one not laid upon the table of the House, but was printed as a proof for the Prime Minister. </para>
