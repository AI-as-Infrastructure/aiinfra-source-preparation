            <para>- 'Without being connected with mercantile affairs, any person who moves in and out among the business men of the different States can see. that there is great commercial tension at the present time, caused by the anxiety in .regard to the Tariff, and I think that there should be some distinct utterance on the part of the Government as to the time when, or at any rate, as to the. latest date on which the Budget Speech will be delivered. There are periods of the year in which the imposition of duties or a change in the Tariff is less inconvenient than at other times, and I would point out to my right honorable friend that on or about the 1st August would be a suitable time, in the interests of commercial convenience for the delivery of the Budget Speech. There is now a very considerable paralysis in business circles because of the delay in adopting a Tariff. Of course this operates more in some of the States than in others, according to the view taken as to the probable reduction or increase of the duties now in force. I do not wish the Prime Minister to give mc a definite reply to-day ; but I should like him to take into consideration whether a Ministerial statement of an authoritative and definite character should not be made, say to-morrow, fixing as nearly as possible a date for the delivery of the Budget Speech. To do that will ' not necessarily in any . way affect the future revenue, but it will give definite information to the commercial classes of Australia as to when a change in the Tariff is likely to be made, and will to some extent ease the tension which at present exists among them. I should like the right honorable gentleman to give me the assurance that the House will at the earliest moment possible be put into possession of some definite information on this subject. </para>

            <para>- The distribution of Bills is, as was intimated the other day, a matter for the. officers of the House, and one for which they accept the full responsibility. If my attention had been called to the fact that some honorable members had not received copies- of the Inter-State Commission Bill I should have seen to the matter before, but as, so far as I knew, copies of that measure had reached honorable members, I have done nothing in regard to it. I have, however, now taken steps which will insure the prompt' distribution of Bills from time to time. </para>

When the Customs Bill is circulated, my honorable friend will probably find some provisions in it which will satisfy him in regard to any doubts which may exercise his mind on the subject, and I hope that he will approve of them. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that that Bill can be taken just yet. There are other matters which must be dealt with before the Tariff is dealt with. I propose to with? draw the Acquisition of Property Bill, because we think that it might well be introduced and dealt with in the Senate before it comes to this House, and we propose to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council to take charge of it. </para>

The proposal by the Attorney-General is not a very ingenious way of dealing with the. question. The whole question that we have to decide at this particular part of the Bill is whether the commissioner- </para>

            <para>- I - It seems to me that the sooner that is done the better, because we are getting no finality to the principle in this Bill. I am sure the Attorney-General will recognise my anxiety to be perfectly fair in this matter. I gave up the idea of challenging the principle on clause 5, and left it to clause 21. But whether I am right or whether I am wrong, I am not going to be diverted from my purpose at this stage. I intend to divide the committee at once, or as soon as the Attorney-General will give me an opportunity, on the question whether or not the commissioner is to have the whole initiation and the whole control of every matter connected with salaries, transfers, grades, and other things of that kind, leaving to the permanent head simply the administration of the department as it . is handed over to him. This does not preclude .the Minister or the commissioner consulting with the permanent head, but it creates in the matter of salaries, grades, transfers, &amp;c, only two' authorities and not three. It makes the initiation come from the commissioner, and gives him real control not of one department, but of the civil service as a whole. The commissioner is beholden to nobody but the Governor-General, which means the Cabinet. I must insist at this stage in intervening, and if the proposal of the Attorney-General is introduced, I shall move that the words "permanent head" be struck out, and " commissioner " substituted, in. order to test the question. I shall move that amendment on the clause as its stands, but I do not want to interfere with the proposal the Attorney-General has to make. </para>

          <para>- 1 do not wish in any way to prevent the honorable member for Wentworth from having a test vote on the question whether the initiation should be with the permanent head or the commissioner ; but, like the honorable member, I do not want to lose my opportunity of having a test vote whether we are to have automatic increases or the system laid down in the Bill. We are at a disadvantage, notwithstanding the explanations we have received, in not having the printed amendments before us. I suggested a little while ago that we might go on with the next portion of the Bill, which does not affect the principle in question here. I can foresee a considerable amount of difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory solution of this question. I understand that the Attorney-General has abandoned the proviso he had in his previous printed amendments. In the new clause he proposes there is no .condition I presume - or, at any rate, no guarantee - that at the age of 21 the officer will receive a salary of £100. </para>

          <para>- The honorable' member for Wentworth is generally very clear, but I must confess that at the present moment I am not quite sure how far he proposes to go. I am thoroughly in accord with his views to this extent, that the commissioner should have the sole responsibility of selecting officers for every position created by the Governor-General in Council,, and for promoting them in the service. But I do not know whether my honorable friend goes so far as to give the commissioner the right to create offices. We know very well that the bane of the public service in the past is that offices have frequently been created for individuals. If the individual who creates the office has the right to fill it, we shall not get rid of that abuse. There are many reasons for keeping; the creation of the office absolutely distinct from the power to select the officers, and I should like to be very clear on this point. I am thoroughly in favour of making the commissioner the supreme power for filling the different offices, subject to the veto of the Minister, and I think he should be able to satisfy the Minister on every occasion that what he does is the right thing, or, at any rate, that he has good grounds for proposing what he does. </para>

            <para>- There is practically no difference. At the present time in New South Wales, and in the past, too, the commissioners have acted without reference to the permanent heads at all. They have absolutely acted in direct opposition to the permanent heads, and they have undermined the departments through ignoring the permanent heads to such a degree that the service is not what it was in a great. many departments. The object of this Bill is not to give the permanent heads undue power. Far be it from me to attempt anything of the kind. It is intended to compel the commissioner to give due respect to the recommendations of the permanent head, who, of all others, is the proper person, and who should know his department and his officers. The honorable member for Wentworth has stated that under clause 12 the position of the permanent head is that, having been supplied with a department and with the officers nesessary to work that department, it is his business to see that it is properly administered, but that he is not to have any power at all to make any recommendations or. suggestions for improvements or alterations in his department after it is given to him. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish that he should have any right to make them, and under the Bill he can only have the right to make recommendations. The honorable member has put the case of the position of the permanent head in the department over which he has presided, and I speak with authority when I say that I know of more than one department in the State of New South Wales that has been dealt with in that way. Because the recommendation of the permanent head was not taken by the commissioners, the department was unfitted to carry out the work intrusted -to it. In the department over which I presided - that of the Treasury - the permanent head was rendered absolutely helpless, and that department and the Works department were undermined, by the action of the commissioners. I am not going to allow any Bill to pass which would permit of such a state of things in the Commonwealth public service. I do not care whether the recommendation of the permanent head be made to the Minister or to the commissioner. I think that, when the Bill was under discussion before, I expressed myself in favour of making the permanent head report to the commissioner, and allowing the commissioner to be the vehicle of communication between the department and the Minister. </para>

I am willing that the commissioner shall be the pivot upon which everything turns, and that the Governor-General shall be the controlling power over him. But we must not destroy the service by ignoring the permanent head. If the commissioner does not accept the recommendation of the permanent head, he must give a reason for ignoring it; and the matter is then put before the Governor-General in Council, who will decide whether the commissioner's decision should be ratified. What I am chiefly fighting for in connexion with this Bill is that the service shall ' be" kept in a proper state of efficiency, and that the permanent head may be made responsible to the commissioner for the efficiency of his department. I do not want to see the service undermined by the commissioner as the public service of New South Wales has been undermined. </para>

          <para>- So far as I can understand the objection of the Minister to the amendment, it amounts to this : that in his experience in New South Wales - which, I admit, is borne out by what we all know - the commissioners have acted in a very arbitrary way, and have refused to indorse the appointments of the permanent heads. What the honorable member for Wentworth proposes is that the commissioner under this Bill shall be the responsible authority, and shall have the right to veto any appointment made by a permanent head. Now, if the commissioner has the right to veto any appointment, he has thereby the power to direct, control, and mould the appointments made in a department. For instance, if the UnderSecretary for Finance and Trade in New South Wales had recommended a certain person for promotion to an important position, and the commissioners had refused to accept his recommendation, he would have had to fall back upon another of, perhaps, half-a-dozen officials - because there are never in a department more than half a dozen who are competent to fill any fairly important position - or allow the commissioners to make the appointment. If the Minister agrees to give the commissioner under the Bill the right to veto, instead of making the direct recommendation of the permanent head that upon which the Executive is. to act, he does what the honorable member for Wentworth wants him to do. </para>

We are bringing into existence a commissioner who will have the control of the public service of the Commonwealth, and we are giving him so many injectors to assist him to look into the work of the various departments, and find out what should and what should not be done. It is true that the Bill contains no very precise definition of the commissioner's powers a,nd privileges, but it states in general terms that he is to control the whole service, and to give directions in regard to it to the Ministry of the day. </para>

            <para>- I should perhaps use the word "recommendations," but they will be to a large extent directions as to what changes should take place, what per- sons should be appointed, what promotions should be made, and what salaries should be given. That being so, it seems to me that all the recommendations should filter through the commissioner, and that the permanent head should not have the right to make a recommendation to the Minister without going through the commissioner. . If I understand the amendment, it is intended to carry out the spirit of the measure by providing that no person in the service shall make a recommendation of any kind to the Ministry of the day except through the commissioner, who, in making his report, will have the advantage of knowing the recommendation of the permanent head, and the advice of his six inspectors. The permanent head, it is true,- will have a very large amount of knowledge, but unless his recommendation has been canvassed and' criticised, -as it should be, by the inspector, who is the watchdog and the eyes and ears of the commissioner, it may be that the Minister, some time or other, would be led into making a wrong appointment or promotion. Whereas, if all be filtered through the commissioner, we have the guarantee that the permanent head is not interfered with, while he has the right to make a recommendation. I would deprive the permanent head of the right to make any recommendation whatever direct to the Minister, but would allow the commissioner to take the recommendation and decide whether it is right or wrong, he having had the inspector's advice on the matter. The amendment is in the right direction, and in accord with the principles of the Bill, and unless I hear some stronger reasons for its rejection than have already been given by the Minister for Home Affairs, I must support the amendment which appears right and just both to the Commonwealth and the public servants themselves. </para>

The time has arrived when this Parliament should put its foot down on political appointments. Already, exception has been taken to several of the appointments which -have just been proposed. Strange to say, the Ministry has fixed the salary of the under-secretary of one of the Federal departments at I believe £800 a year. The Minister in charge of that department is put in a higher position than that of a State Minister, .but the principal under-secretary of the Federal department is placed in a lower position than that occupied by the corresponding official in the State service. In view of the fact that we recognise that the position of a Minister under the Federal Parliament is higher than that of a State Minister, we should recognise that the position of the Federal Principal UnderSecretary, is at all events equal to that of an under-secretary in the States. </para>

            <para>- It has a great deal to do with the question, because it shows the importance of putting the commissioner in as strong a position as possible. Under the clause it would be impossible for the commissioner to act in any way, in regard to promotion or appointments, unless he had the recommendation of the permanent head of the department. If the commissioner thought the recommendation of the permanent head was not a right one, I doubt whether the commissioner would have any power to make an. appointment. It seems to me that full power is placed in the hands of the permanent head, and if so, what is the use of having a commissioner ? I fully agree with honorable members that it is only right that the commissioner should have the under-secretary or permanent head to make a recommendation - and any commissioner who knows his business would ask for it - in order that he may be put in the position of knowing exactly what is going on in the department. But have we not appointed six inspectors in order that the commissioner may be put in a position to obtain reliable information even-outside the permanent head, and in order that he may act in a way that will be fair and just to the service.

            <para>- The finding of the board is there regarded as being final. Under subclause (2) it is possible for the permanent head to deal directly with the Governor-General and bring about a certain result. The ordinary person asks if that be so why is it necessary to have a commissioner; why should the recommendation not go through the commissioner ? On the other hand, it is said, with absolute truth, why ignore the permanent head ? I think we can readily find a solution of the difficulty. Every communication should go through the commissioner, because if we are going to employ a competent man, at a . large salary, he should be a party to everything that takes place. Surely that is one fundamental principle - as fundamental a principle as that the Executive should have the final power of veto. Why should the commissioner be excluded under the circumstances ? </para>

If the permanent head on the one side has the power of recommending, and the Executive on the other side has the power of veto; the commissioner is not much more than a. funnel- if he has not the power of finally settling or of .originating he is not much more than a funnel.

I am only trying to find a way out of the difficulty which the Minister for Home Affairs, with his considerable experience, has reason to fear, namely, that persons competent to express opinions will not be asked for their opinions on these matters. Could the clause not be made to provide that the commissioner shall make the recommendation, having with it a report from the permanent head? I can see that the commissioner can get a report without our putting a provision in the Bill, but if it were provided in the Bill, that would meet the objection of the Minister for Home Affairs. </para>

            <para>- If the permanent head and the commissioner agree, you get rid of the objection that the permanent head has the right of making a recommendation and that the commissioner is ignored. Take the second case, which was in the mind of the honorable member for Wentworth a few moments ago, where the permanent head wants one thing and the commissioner wants another. I would allow the commissioner under the circumstances to make his recommendation to the Cabinet, but at the same time' he should furnish a report from the permanent head. The Executive would then accept their responsibility of deciding the matter, and finding a way out of the difficulty. If this clause were made to read that there must be a recommendation by the commissioner with a report from the permanent head showing, in case of disagreement, his objections - because these should be noticed - then the responsibility devolves on the Cabinet or the Executive of finding a way out of the difficulty. </para>

          <para>- I think -that this matter has been put very clearly before the House, notably.by the honorable member for Bourke. That honorable member said that his earnest desire was to carry out the intention of the measure by securing to the Commonwealth public' service immunity from political influence. Of course I recognise that the permanent head of a department may be located in Sydney, or Melbourne, or anywhere else ; and that the . officers under the control of the commissioner, or the great bulk of them, may be scattered over Australia. But the six inspectors who are provided for in this Bill will furnish the commissioner with an independent board of inquiry. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the inspectors from asking the permanent heads of departments to supply them with information, which they, in their turn, will give to the commissioner, he, in his turn, supplying it to the Executive. I think the commissioner is less likely to be swayed by political influence than is the permanent head. A Minister of the Crown is brought into frequent contact with the permanent head of the department, and he does perhaps unconsciously wield a certain influence. The amendment proposed does not prevent the commissioner from obtaining the recommendation of the permanent head. </para>

            <para>- I think that he ought to have it. But let us suppose that the permanent head recommends a certain course. The commissioner, on the advice of his inspectors, is perhaps prepared to advise something else. In that case we should bring the commissioner into conflict with the permanent head, and immediately we do that we destroy the efficacy of this measure. I think that the danger of political influence is stronger in the case of the permanent head than it is in the case of the commissioner, and for that reason I shall support the amendment. The honorable member for Richmond has said that there is no necessity for a division upon this matter. Obviously he is in favour of the amendment, and the honorable member for Bourke has also indicated that he will support it. </para>

            <para>- I said that I did not wish from my past experience to see the permanent head ignored. If the permanent head who is responsible for. the working of the department voluntarily makes a report to the commissioner well and good. If the commissioner by reason of any information which he has, makes a request to the permanent head upon any proposal, the report will come in in that way. The permanent head cannot be ignored, and before any action is taken, his report will have to be obtained. </para>

            <para>- I am glad that the Minister for Home Affairs does not desire to ignore the permanent heads. This is one of the defects in the New South Wales Act. It would be a very objectionable thing, however, to allow the permanent heads to take the initiative. Provision has been made in this Bill that officers shall be interchangeable, in other words that, an officer shall not remain in one department, if he is more fitted to go into another. </para>

            <para>- Very well. If the permanent head is to know his own department he will have a very difficult task, because he has no inspectors as the commissioner has, and he can know of that only which comes under his own immediate observation. Consequently, he could not be in a position to readily carry out what is manifestly one of the intentions of this measure, namely, an effective interchange of officers from one department to another. . Further than that, the commissioner having inspectors - who are really sub commissioners in the different States - is in a better position to know the calibre and capacity of the officers than is the permanent head. If the Minister will put the matter in that way, I think the honorable member for Wentworth might accept the proposal that the initiative should rest with the commissioner. </para>

I would not say that the commissioner must take the initiative, because something might come to the knowledge of the permanent head which would justify him in supposing that an alteration should be made in his department, and we could not very well say to him - " You must not report to the commissioner." </para>

            <para>- The commissioner is not told he shall do it here, but we take it for granted that he will. The Attorney-General asked me to test this question on the first sub-clause, but if I had been proceeding in my own way on the second sub-clause I would have altered the words "permanent head" into "commissioner." At the same time, I would have had no objection to add to that "on the report of the permanent head." I am quite willing to put in any words which will be a direction to the commissioner to take counsel from the permanent head. There is no objection to that, but we are not contesting that question now. I do not want any misconception as to the course we are now adopting. We are now testing the question whether the commissioner shall be the controller of the service, and the initiator of everything connected with its management, and if I cannot proceed in my own way in this matter I shall have to fall back on the Bill and bring in my amendments clause by clause. </para>

            <para>- I - It seems to me that we have here a trinity of irresponsibility. The Minister has said that we do not want political influence ; but if we do not have political influence we shall have social influence. Did the honorable and learned gentleman ever know anyone to be appointed without the exercise of social or political influence ? I never did, though I have offered a reward for such a person. Are Members of Parliament reaching such a depth of irresponsibility that they are afraid to face this question, and must fall back upon society ? If Ministers are to have no power, so that we cannot come to them when our people want us to do so, the thing for us to do is to get some society friend whom we can appeal to, and who will boss the commissioner, or the permanent head, or the Governor-General. This country is no different from any other country in the world. Human beings are human beings everywhere. One man runs another, and the other man runs him. I hope that the Ministry will not take all responsibility from the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- Yes, certainly. In subclause (6) we have provided that after a man has spent a year in the clerical division and has passed an examination he can get a salary of £110 a year. But we are still faced with the question of what a man should be paid for the first year after he. passes from the general to the clerical division. As he is being in a sense introduced to his work, he can scarcely ask to carry over his full salary with him. I think that all we have to provide is the amount of salary allotted to him for the first twelve months before he passed his examination. Up to the present I have not been able to make up my mind upon this matter, but probably my colleague, the Minister for Home Affairs, will be able to make some suggestion. With the exception of the item I have indicated, it seems to me that this sub-clause meets all that is required in regard "to the general division. </para>

I wish to know whether those who pass these clerical examinations get any priority over outsiders. Under the Victorian Act a certain number of vacancies are set aside for which the general division may compete. That in effect is giving them a priority. I do not see any provision in this Bill for a certain number of vacancies being set aside. I further desire to know whether a register will be kept of all those who pass this examination, so that as further vacancies occur they may be appointed. </para>

            <para>- It will be necessary, perhaps, to have separate examinations for different departments, because the duties to be performed in the Customs, for instance, will be very different from those attaching to the Defence department. Then again, in the post-office, a man in the clerical branch would require to have special skill in deciphering handwriting. Moreover, I presume that there will be different standards for the different departments. All the examinations are to be competitive, and the clause as now worded, makes that compulsory. </para>

I think a good deal of expense would be saved to the Government if they were empowered under the regulations to adopt the examinations at the Universities, or to prescribe what examinations at the University would suffice. Something will have to be done in the way of literary work at these service examinations, and I think we should make use as far as possible of the three or four Universities within, the Federation for the purposes of this literary work. I do not say we should take away from the Government the power of appointing examiners, but the Government should have the discretion of working in with the Universities as far as possible and of declaring that certain University examinations should be equivalent to their own.

          <para>- Yes. I rose to support the suggestion of the honorable and learned member, for Northern Melbourne, who asks that the passing of any approved examination - say, for example, the Public Senior University examination - should be sufficient to qualify a man for entrance to the clerical branch. This practice is adopted in connexion with many of the State services. For instance, entrance to the Education Department in South Australia is by competitive examination, but the person who passes the Senior Public University examination is not required to pass the pupil teacher's examination also. If an examination is of as high a standard as that prescribed by the regulations, I can see no reason why a person who has passed it should be called upon to pass the prescribed examination. </para>

          <para>- I hope that the Government will not make the amendment which has been suggested by the Attorney-General to allow the passing of other examinations than those prescribed under the regulations to qualify the candidate for admission. In Victoria we have deliberately abandoned the system of recognising any but the examinations under the Public Service Act; and no complaint has been heard against that practice. I cannot conceive of circumstances under which the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would be workable. The object of the examination is to create a list of persons who are probably able to learn the duties of the public service and perform them properly. Excepting for the creation of the list, there could be no use for the examination ; and this list, when created, must create a certain priority on the list. If we are to have an examination by the University of Melbourne, and other examinations by the Universities of Sydney and Adelaide, and also a public service examination by another examiner somewhere else, how can we have a list in any order of merit or otherwise ? When we create a list of persons qualified to enter the public service, it must begin with the number 1, and end with the last man. The only practical and possible scheme is to submit all to the same test ; otherwise the injustice is so obvious that the matter is not worthy of consideration. If the relative positions be not determined by some such test, how are they to be determined ? Is it to be on the commissioner's nomination, by the recommendation of the permanent head, ratified by the Governor-General % If so, what a time everybody will have in determining the priority of people who have passed examinations in half-a-dozen different places. I assume it is to be a competitive examination, and the only reasonable way is to submit all candidates to the one test. </para>

          <para>- I was just about to say that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Governor-General appointing as examiners any persons in the Universities. If it be deemed advisable to take that step, it can be taken without adding any words to the clause j but I am rather opposed to University examination. There should be one general examination. The examiners in the general examination will have the candidates before them, and can give their report on the marks. All this will come from the one source, and the examiners will understand the rotation in which candidates stand better than will examiners who send recommendations from the Universities and other various sources. There is nothing in the clause to prevent the Governor-General in Council appointing University examiners, but I prefer the clause as drawn. </para>

I would point out to the honorable and learned member for Corinella that clause 3 merely says that the Act shall not apply to "any examiner under this Act who is not an officer " - it does not say that the examiners may not be officers, as they very likely would be. It was quite in contemplation to appoint officers to be examiners. </para>

It will be found that the Universities will co-operate with the Minister in the different centres, and consent to hold examinations of a certain character and give marks, letting the Minister know which candidates are first, second, third, and so forth. But the University will appoint the examiners, whereas under the Bill it is the Governor-General in Council who appoints. </para>

          <para>- I perfectly agree with what the Minister for Home Affairs has said in regard to this matter. Take the case of Western Australia where there is no University, although there are high-class schools. The University examiners might possibly adopt one line of examination, in which case although the lads from the Western State might be very intelligent, they would be at a disadvantage, lacking as they do the benefits of a University education. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will allow the clause to remain as it is. It would be fair all round to allow the Governor-General to appoint his own examiners. </para>

The first named limits the number of competitors to be admitted to the competitive examinations, whilst subclause (e) provides that the method of limiting the number of candidates shall be by lot. I am pretty confident that the committee will agree that we cannot have a more ridiculous method of selecting our civil servants than by lot. If I could think of another method by which the number of candidates to be examined could be limited I should put it forward. </para>

          <para>- The course which, upon inquiry, I personally favour in regard to the general division, and indeed for the other divisions if necessary, is a course analogous to that adopted by the Police department in a number of the States. In Victoria when fresh police are required an independent board is appointed and the applicants are compelled to pass before these experts. The health and physique of the applicants are great factors to be taken into account. As a means for reducing the number of candidates for examination, I think that no better scheme can be found. For the general division it seems to be the best method with which we have any acquaintance, and even for the other divisions it appears to be a good plan to adopt. An impartial board might very well be appointed to see the candidates and select those who appear best fitted for the work to be undertaken. As far as the police force and the permanent military force are concerned, the system has worked admirably, and has resulted in giving us two of the finest bodies of men to be seen anywhere in the world. </para>

In the public service examinations conducted by the State of South Australia, it has not been found that an extraordinary number of competitors present themselves, though -of course more candidates pass than there are places for them to fill. </para>

            <para>- No. The number of positions vacant in the Commonwealth service will probably be sufficient to absorb a reasonable number of those who present themselves! The only difficulty that can arise from placing no limit on the number of candidates is that there will be a few more to examine than there would otherwise be ; but that is not of much importance. I recognise that the Government have done well in consenting to do away with the choosing by lot, and they will do still better if they provide that there shall be no limitation to the number of candidates who may present themselves. </para>

          <para>- I agree with the honorable member for South Australia in what he said about the lot system. It has been our experience in Victoria that it is unsatisfactory to candidates, and has not worked well. But I do not agree with the honorable member that it is advisable to throw open the various Commonwealth posts which may be vacant to an unlimited number of applicants. For all such positions there are always a great many applicants who are obviously unsuitable, and it is cruel to allow them to waste their time and money by presenting themselves for examination. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of that ; but if it is such as some that I have had brought under my notice recently, it will, not be of much value. I think that the system which has been applied in regard to the police force of Victoria is one which the Government .might well . adopt, and an expert committee might be appointed to reduce the number of applicants to what might be considered reasonable. My honorable friend seems to think that the number of applicants would not be unduly large ; but my experience has been that when positions of this kind are vacant, an unduly large number of applicants always present themselves, and a great proportion of them are altogether unfit for the positions to which they aspire. </para>

            <para>- I know for a fact that it is not. Every person in the State is entitled to apply to be allowed to enter its public service if he thinks that he is fitted to do so, and the only persons who should be allowed to decide upon his fitness are the doctors and the duly appointed examiners. If a man has so poor a knowledge of his qualifications and so confounds his ability with his ambition as to offer himself for examination for a position for which he is quite unsuited. that is not our fault. What harm could it do to let as many as present themselves be examined ? It would only mean that a few more papers would have to be looked through, and a competent examiner could see in a moment or two if a candidate was obviously unsuitable. Rut if 100 applicants present themselves, and you arbitrarily determine that only 50 shall be allowed to sit for examination, the chances are even that you turn away the best men. </para>

            <para>- Yes. We do not live amongst a nation of fools ; we live amongst intelligent, people ; and it is very soon known what boys are likely to succeed at these examinations. There should be no limitation by rule of thumb. Personally, I would just as soon see the final determination come to by lot, as decide by lot who shall be permitted to present themselves. If in Sydney 5,000 men presented themselves for appointment to the police force, the Inspector-General would be able to pick out the obviously unsuitable men in a few seconds ; and in the same way competent examiners would detect obviously unsuitable candidates for admission to the Commonwealth public service. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but all the others who passed the examination would be entitled to come into the service in turn, as vacancies fell due. If the number of those who passed the examination was very large, their names would overload the register, and there would be no opportunity for others to present themselves for examinations for many years to come. We must give some discretionary power to the commissioner. If we appoint 50 of the successful applicants, do honorable members think that all the other applicants who pass the examination should be compelled to present themselves again in the event of more positions becoming vacant ? </para>

I admit that there is a good deal in the suggestion that there should be something in the nature of a preliminary examination, like that adopted in regard to the police force in New South Wales and in Victoria. It should not be set down in so man}' words what the examination is to be, but I would agree to the appointment of a board, whose duty it would be to cull out those whom they thought the best men. They would, perhaps, put a few questions to the candidates, and would, of course, take into consideration their physical strength. The honorable member for Perth said that in the old country there were preliminary examinations before the real examinations. </para>

          <para>- Yes, it can. I am not sure whether we properly apprehend the meaning of clause 25. It is quite true that the clause states that it shall be the duty of the commissioner to give public notice of several things, including the mode of limiting the number of competitors to be examined ; but the clause does not say that the commissioner has the right to prescribe the mode. If we turn to clause 71, we find that it is the Governor-General who has the right to make regulations for limiting the number. Therefore, I think we have been a little in the dark in debating the clause, having assumed all along that it is the commissioner who has the discretion. </para>

          <para>- It is undeniable that a great deal is to be said for the view taken by the Minister for Home Affairs, that some sort of preliminary limitation is desirable, the only matter in dispute being what character this preliminary limitation is to take. I understand that in the British civil service there is no preliminary limitation other than that the Candidate shall be medically sound and shall present a personal character of fitness, respectability, and so on. In England, supposing there are fifteen vacancies in the Customs department, and 1,000 applicants, the whole number of suitable men will go up, and the highest fifteen in the examination are put into the vacancies. That is the method pursued in the English civil service, at any rate so far as the lower grades are concerned. </para>

            <para>- I know of- my own personal knowledge that in England the only limitation is that candidates must pass a medical test and present an ordinary personal character and testimony of respectability, signed by a clergyman - or something of the kind. In England the highest fifteen in the examination are put on first. The sixteenth and the twentieth, and so on, do not get subsequent vacancies, but a fresh examination is held, and the first fifteen in that examination get appointed. I quite understand the difficulty that presents itself to the Minister's mind, and to the mind of every man, that we do not want a whole heap of people who are quite unsuitable presenting themselves, but if these people like to pay the fee of 5s. or 10s. it is their look out, and if they do not pass, they must go down. The Government seems particularly enamoured of selection by lot. </para>

          <para>- I think that the Minister in charge of the Bill really needs to consider where we are drifting to. The proposal which is now made does not apparently take into account that these appointments may be for different States. The examinations might take place simultaneously in the different States for appointments in each State. Then if the allotment of marks is made upon the same basis in each State, as I have no doubt it will be, it may happen that the next in order of merit for an appointment in Queensland may be some person in Western Australia. If this provision is inserted, I do not see how the commissioner can get away from the instruction contained in this clause. Again, let us suppose that two or three probationers are wanted for appointment. As the clause is drawn the permanent head of the department has the light to estimate their worth and to continue them in their positions or discharge them. Thus it happens, that a probationer may be only six months in the public service. Again, perhaps two or three probationers who have attained the highest number of marks at the examinations have been chosen for certain positions, and one or two of them have been found unsuitable for their appointment. In such a case is there to be a reference back to the examination of six months before to discover the next best qualified person at that examination so that he may be appointed to the vacant position, -or is a fresh examination to be held ? There is also this fact to be considered, that if only one or two probationers are to be appointed and we have to call an examination for that purpose throughout the States, or a State, we shall have an- enormous amount of trouble for a very small and unimportant appointment. I think that the whole matter requires consideration. I would suggest to the Minister in charge of the Bill that he should reserve these clauses for the fuller consideration they require. Such an amendment as the honorable member for Corio has moved, would still further complicate the already complicated clauses in the Bill. Unless this matter is reserved for fuller consideration, we shall get into the position that this part of the regulations will be found unworkable. </para>

          <para>- The last speaker has said that if in the filling of any appointment the names of successful candidates have to be taken in their order of merit from the register, a man in Queensland who has passed higher than a candidate in Western Australia might be wanted for a position in Western Australia. But I would point out that the same objection constantly arises even under those services which have registers. A man might want to go into the Law department, and perhaps there is a vacancy in the post-office. In such a case it becomes the right of the man who has passed with the highest number of marks to say, " I will not take the post-office appointment, but I will reserve myself for the Law department." I submit, that the first in the order of merit should have the right to say whether or not he will accept the vacant position. If the Queensland man does not choose to go to Western Australia upon receiving an intimation that he can have the vacant appointment if he so desires, he need not accept, but can wait till a more convenient appointment is open. This method strikes me as being the fairest one to adopt. </para>

We have to deal with the whole continent, not merely with one department of State but with several departments of State, and are we not going to give the commissioner the opportunity of selecting from the probationers the men who are most suitable for different parts of the service, or for different work? According to the contention of the honorable and learned member for Corio, if there is a vacancy in any department the next man upon the list must be given the opportunity of filling that vacancy. </para>

          <para>- This clause makes provision for special cases, and I notice that the Government may on the report of the commissioner nominate certain persons without examination or probation for appointment to the service ; but that no suchappointmentshfi.il be made unless there is no person available in the service who is capable of filling the position. It is further provided that a copy of every report shall be laid on the table of the House as soon as practicable after the meeting of Parliament. It appears to me that that clause can deal with only certain very extraordinary cases, and according to sub-clause (3) power is given to the Governor-General to veto any appointment made under the authority of the clause. I propose to move the addition of the words " and such appointment shall be subject to its approval " at the end of subclause (2). The latter part of the sub-clause will then read - </para>

            <para>- That sub-clause deals with a case where the Governor-General does not approve, but I want a provision to apply to a case in which the Governor-General does approve. I desire that when the Governor-General approves, Parliament should approve, and that no appointment be vested in any man until Parliament has approved. This will be an entire departure from ordinary principle. I am at one with, the Minister in saying there should be no political patronage, but in this particular case it is proposed to import; it may be, somebody from abroad to take an extraordinary appointment. Some extraordinary appointments have been made recently, and a great deal of criticism has been excited by them ; and surely we are not going to take away from Parliament the right of approving or disapproving of such extraordinary appointments, when the Bill makes ample provision for any ordinary appointment, whereby an ordinary position, however responsible or high, can be readily filled. </para>

But I see no practicable way of doing that and it would be far better for us to leave such appointments with the report of the permanent head, the recommendation of the commissioner, and the responsibility of the Minister. The responsibility of the Minister is, after all, the principal thing, and it would be going too far and interfering with the practical working of the departments to say that there should be no appointment unless Parliament approves. </para>

            <para>- The idea that Parliament should share the powers of the Executive and be called on to practically make appointments, gives Parliament a power which would have a mischievous effect. It would deprive Parliament largely of its power to criticise the Executive, and make it a co-sharer with the Executive in those appointments for which it should be responsible only in the second degree. Parliament should be responsible only as a body to criticise the action of the Ministry, and bring them to book whenever they make an appointment which meets with their disapproval and that of the country. If the Ministry make an appointment which does not meet with the approval of Parliament and the country, there is a means lying very properly in the hands of Parliament for dealing with Ministers, and dealing with them summarily. </para>

Where the Governor-General accepts the nomination of the commissioner, it is not thought desirable to la}' an}' statement before Parliament; but where the Governor-General exercises his veto regarding the appointment of a man recommended by the commissioner, his reasons should be laid before Parliament in order to show why the recommendation was not agreed to. </para>

          <para>- The result of the clause now is, apparently, that the Governor in Council has a veto twice over. An appointment cannot be made if the Governor in Council twice refuses the recommendation of the commissioner. That is to say, if the commissioner's first recomdation is refused, and he then makes another, and that is refused, no appointment can be made. Is that the meaning ? There is nothing in the clause to show that the commissioner is to go on recommending, after the second veto of the Governor-General. </para>

          <para>- I quite agree that there should be a limit as to the age. But I am not in favour of the amendment which has been suggested by the honorable member for Bourke. Our experience in Victoria has been that too many boys, of tender years have been brought into the public service to do work which should be done by men at men's wages, and I am totally opposed to the introduction of boy labour. I prefer that the lads should be at school, in order that they ma)' be better fitted to cany out the duties of life properly rather than that they should be put, into the public service at too early an age. Furthermore, it would not be well for the Commonwealth to cram the public service with a number of inefficient infants to the exclusion of men who are probably requiring employment. I think fourteen years is quite young enough . It is intended, . apparently, that these boys should be employed almost exclusively in the post-offices, and as there .are important duties connected with every department of work in the post-office, and as the lads would have opportunities of acquiring information which it is not desirable that they should have, and opportunities for committing serious irregularities which should not be put in their way, no children of tender years should be employed there.

          <para>- I think the committee are trying to legislate too much altogether, and I do not know where ministerial responsibility is to come in. We have a huge service and shall require boys and men for all sorts of purposes, and surely we can trust the Executive Government with the clause as it stands to select for the particular purpose the necessary lads or youths. If Parliament find that the Government of the day are employing unduly young persons, it is for us to instruct the Government not to do so any longer. To combine in this clause a great number of regulations which should be left to the Executive Government will be simply to create difficulties which will cause great embarrassment in the future administration of the service.

          <para>- I would like to call attention to the word "appointment" in that portion of the sub-clause which the Minister has just announced his intention of transposing. If boys over thirteen years are appointed, I take it that the sub-clause means they are appointed under the Act, and will be entitled to stay in the service in the same way as any other civil servant. I do not know whether it is intended to adopt the "Victorian Post-office Act, which allows boys to be employed between the ages of thirteen and seventeen years ; but under that Act boys have to leave at seventeen years of age if there is no man's appointment to which they can be properly promoted. </para>

Why is he eligible for transfer, whilst another man, who is in the railway service, is not so eligible? I intend to have a test question made of this matter, and if necessary, I shall press it to a division. </para>

            <para>- The only departments that we have taken over are departments altogether outside the railways. We have taken over the Post-office, the Customs, and the Defence departments. These are part and parcel of the public service of each of the States. We have not touched the railways in any of the States, and no railway servants participate in the privileges attached to the public service in any State. If the amendment of the honorable member for South Australia is carried, we shall be adopting a. new system altogether, and one which will complicate matters very much. We propose to take outside persons after they have passed a certain examination ; but if this amendment is carried, I do not think that we shall want any outsiders, because we shall have sufficient men in the railway service to fill up any gaps that may arise.. It is an extreme case to allow all the railway servants to participate in the Commonwealth service, when the States will not allow them to enter in the State services. </para>

          <para>- I would point put that in this clause the Minister is creating rights for departments not yet appertaining to the Commonwealth at all. There are the Education department, the Mines department, the Law department, and so on. The officers of these departments have no rights under the Commonwealth. The Minister proposes to give rights to them, and I agree with him. I think that since the States have to bear the expense of federation, some facilities should be given for transferring employes of the States ' to the Commonwealth where it is desirable that they should be transferred. But as we are creating rights in favour of departments that have not those fights at present, I do not see the logic of including those departments, and at the same time refusing the same rights to employes of the Railway department. Therefore I urge the reconsideration of the matter. </para>

Injustice would also be done to public servants in other States by reason of the different ways in which their Public Service Acts have been framed. Having that in view, we ought to regard the term "public service" as referring to all who are in the service of the State in any Capacity whatever, whether under a Public Service Act or not. </para>

          <para>- The honorable and learned member for Indi says that this clause confers privileges. I have been reading the clause, with the desire, if possible, of understanding why it was inserted in the Bill, and I should say the object was not to confer privileges upon the public servants of the State, but in owier that the Commonwealth Parliament, if trained men were required in addition to those in the departments taken over under the Constitution Act, might obtain the services of civil servants from the various States. Consequently in taking them over it is desirable to provide that those men shall not lose their privileges which they possess in the States. The clause is inserted, it appears to me, for the purpose of conferring privileges on those members of the public service who are limited to the strict public service. The inclusion of railway men is not the intention of the clause. The object is to enable the Federal Government to take over the services of such officers as are required, and in so doing to make them subject to the provisions of this general measure. </para>

            <para>- The clause states that an officer, before entering the service, must pay the amount of compensation, or gratuity, he received before retiring from the State service. The New South Wales Act provides that he can, after the appointment, repay any compensation he receives by instalments. Do I understand that the Minister proposes to omit sub-clause (2) with a view to proposing another sub-clause to meet these cases ? </para>

          <para>- I wish to ask whether the clause as it stands does not" create some danger of the younger men in the service having their positions prejudiced by the re-appointment of men who have retired for good and sufficient reasons. We should not, in the interest of the service as a whole, allow these re-appointments to be made easily. </para>

        <para>Such sum shall be refunded upon the person so appointed retiring from the service of the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>I admit that I had not thought of the point which has been raised by the honorable member for Indi. On the face of it, I do not see why the Commonwealth should receive money which it has not paid to the officer. The proper course would be to make the payment back to the State. </para>

An arrangement of that sort is very often made in New South Wales, under which deductions are made from the yearly salary until the whole amount has been repaid. </para>
