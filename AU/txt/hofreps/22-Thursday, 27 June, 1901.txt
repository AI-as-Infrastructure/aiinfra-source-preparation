                    <para>- There are certain things in regard to temporary employment which are not very satisfactory to the men. I think it should be specified in the clause that temporary employes should receive at least the same minimum as is paid to permanent officers, and a half-holiday per week where it. is given as well as the gazetted holidays. In some cases the temporary employes get the gazetted holidays, but they do not get paid for them. They are compelled to take the holidays and do not receive any pay. I think the temporary hands in the general division should receive the same consideration as the lowest paid officer therein. </para>

                    <para>- I would like the Minister for Home Affairs to explain the reason for sub-clause (3). In South Australia there has been a considerable amount of friction about men who have been on the temporary list ; and after considerable trouble there certain privileges were obtained for such men after they are employed twelve months continuously. Whether it is true or otherwise it has been frequently reported that in a great number of instances care is taken that the men shall not be twelve months employed, so as to prevent them from being entitled to certain privileges which are allowed after they are employed for that period. Without having . any reason assigned for it, it seems a singular proceeding that a man who has been nine months in temporary employment - that is allowing an extreme case, where provision is made for an extension of three months - is to be put off and barred from getting temporary employment for a' considerable time afterwards. I would ask the Minister to explain the reason for this provision in the clause. </para>

                    <para>- The principal, reason is that in some of the States a system has grown up under which temporary employment has amounted almost to permanent employment. In New South Wales we have had men temporarily employed for between 20 and 30 years. That is a most unsatisfactory state of things, and one object of this provision is to prevent such a state of things occurring under the Bill. Another reason for the provision is that "one person shall not be continuously appointed temporarily. If the work is required to be done; let that man or another man be appointed permanently. ' The temporary employment is to be availed of only in the case of a rush of work which will be of a temporary character, and not to get on a number of men as temporary hands for an indefinite term. Besides that, it gives an opportunity to bring into the service persons who do not pass through the ordinary classification and examination, and who may take the place of the permanent hands who should be employed. I think the honorable member will see that we have had an experience in this matter which is not satisfactory and which should be stopped. </para>

                    <para>- I would like to emphasize what the honorable member for Yarra lias pointed out, and to get an assurance from the Minister as to what he proposes to do in regard to the appointment of temporary hands. What the honorable member for Yarra said is notorious, but it is also notorious that those persons who are permanently temporary hands, if I may so put it, are paid considerably less than the officers who are working in a regular way. Surely that is not fair either to the men or to the public. I would urge that the Minister should give an assurance that the Government intend to protect temporary employes by seeing that when they are doing like work with permanent employes they shall be paid the same rate of remuneration. I quite agree with the honorable gentleman as to the need for the clause, and .shall support it, but I think the committee should receive an assurance as to how temporary employes are to be treated. </para>

                        <para>- I would suggest that after the word "select," in line 7, the words "in such manner as may be prescribed" be inserted. I see the permanent head is here again, and I do not know whether any objection is raised to that by the honorable member for Wentworth, in pursuance of his crusade in favour of the commissioner. I have been recently getting the impression that that honorable member is not following his maxim so rauch as he is following the maxim of the county fair - wherever you see a permanent head, hit him. In. this case, however, it is difficult to make the commissioner select men for temporary work, and though I am not quite sure this is the proper place, I move - </para>

                    <para>- Of course ; but I am talking about men who have been previously in the service of the States, but now ' are temporarily employed in the service of the Commonwealth. If these men are not taken over as permanent hands, they will all be dismissed after they have had six months' service, and that means a serious tiling in some of the States. So far as South Australia is concerned, there will not be any trouble, because the practice is that when a man has been' twelve months temporarily employed, he is regarded as a permanent hand, and has all the rights and privileges of a permanent hand. I under- ' stand that in Victoria, however, there are a considerable number of men temporarily employed, and these will necessarily have to be dismissed. I understand from an honorable member that that is the practice in New South Wales to a still greater extent than in Victoria, and I should like to hear what the Minister's ideas are as to the wholesale sacking of those men. </para>

                        <para>- This clause seems to be very defective from the point of view of the Minister, who wishes to prevent the continuation of temporary employment. Will the Minister consider the desirableness of attaching a sub-clause, making it possible to draft from the temporary list into the permanent list, as an instruction to officers to prevent temporary employment whether by one or two sets of men? The effect is the same whether we have temporary men for 20 years or for one year, if we have two sets of men to work on. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that in this clause it is very questionable whether we ought not to retain the permanent head as the person connected with temporary employment, seeing that further on the commissioner comes in so that there can be no damage done to the public service. But as regards the proposal of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, it would be very dangerous to introduce it here. The arguments we applied last night in another case hold good here. It is impossible in the wide area of this Commonwealth, and with the diversity of officers and work, to pin any permanent head down to the selection of men. The man next on the list might be a person utterly unfit for the service required. </para>

                    <para>- I must also take exception to the clause as it stands at present. It seems to me the clause will militate very seriously against the efficiency of the service, if the principle be admitted of dismissing temporary hands after they have been a certain time at work. If work requires to be continued it is reasonable to assume that the man who has been employed on it is the best man to be continued on it. To change him for a fresh man would, to my mind, from a business point of view, be detrimental to the interests of the service. </para>

I was about to say that if this temporary employment is not made actually temporary by some provision we shall get into the public service a lot of unnecessary men who will be kept there by influence, because the permanent head of a department has the appointment of the temporary hands and is subject to his Minister. In another State that system has resulted in a number of men being kept employed who were not really required, and the service has therefore been swelled unduly. The fact that men cannot be kept permanently employed on what are really temporary works will induce the permanent heads to make permanent appointments where there is need for them rather than lose at the end of six or nine months the men who have been accustomed to the work. I would draw the attention of the Minister for Home Affairs to the need for a verbal alteration in sub-clause (3). It seems to me that the words "for nine months continuously where extended as hereinafter provided " in the second place 'in which they are used are unnecessary and should be omitted. </para>

The object of the clause is to prevent temporary employment being continued.

                        <para>- I have just made some inquiry as to the probable effect of the provision we have been discussing, and I am informed that there will be no necessity for turning these men out of the service. They will be taken over under the provisions of the Commonwealth Act in the same way as permanent hands. Of course, if we do not require them, they will have to be got rid of. There will have to be some system of weeding out in connexion with the officers taken over. I have heard only to-day that there are a great many more officers proportionately in the service of one State than in the service of the other States, and we shall have to find out what is the cause. If our questions are not satisfactorily answered the men who are in excess of requirements will have to be weeded out, and the weeding-out process will necessarily be commenced amongst those men who are temporarily employed. If, on the other hand, however, it should be necessary to increase the staff in any State, I think the men who have been temporarily employed should have first consideration, and I have no doubt they will be considered before new hands are taken on. </para>

In some of the departments in South Australia, notably in the Customs and the Post-office and Telegraph departments, I have known of instances where men have been on the provisional and temporary list for something like twelve or fifteen years. Although I do not wish to introduce 'State or provincial politics into this debate, I may mention that this position of affairs is due to the fact that the State Government have not brought in a Civil Service Bill to properly provide for the rights of these men who have now been passed over to the control of the Federal Parliament. I would like to ask the Minister whether there is anything in the Bill that will give any reasonable protection to these men ? In the Post and Telegraph department there are not tens but hundreds of men throughout the service whose positions have not been properly considered by the State Parliament, and I would ask" the Minister to look into this particular question, so that reasonable consideration may be given to their length of service and the rights which should attach to them, and which should have been provided for by local legislation. 'There are many cases where great hardship will 'be inflicted if these men are not placed on the same footing as permanent hands, and I should like to see a clause put in which would protect them against the consequence of the neglect of the local Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- The only clause that bears upon their position seems to me to be clause 29, which refers to officers of a temporary or casual character, but I am quite certain that no one could pretend that the provisional and temporary staff of South Australia is of a temporary or casual character, because their positions are undoubtedly permanent. The public service is divided into two sections, viz., those on- the civil list and those on the provisional and temporary list, and the only difference between the two divisions is that the servants in one division are entitled to a Board of Inquiry, in case of dismissal. There is not very much else to distinguish them except perhaps that the salaries of those on the civil list increase automatically. I think that three-fourths of the whole of the South Australian public servants are on the provisional and temporary list. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt a very important question has been raised in this matter. I was not aware that in South Australia such a large number of those who might be called public servants were holding temporary positions. There are a good many in other States, but that has been rectified to a large extent in New South Wales. The point is so important that I hope the honorable member will be content to let it rest until I make inquiries. If I find that there is the slightest risk of our throwing out a great number of men who have been practically permanent employes, but who have been classed as temporary, I will have a provision put in the Bill that will give them the same rights as if they were on the permanent staff. </para>

                    <para>- During the course of the proceedings in committee, sir, my attention was called by an honorable member to the fact that a stranger was present on the floor of the chamber. I was asked to give a ruling, and in accordance with the standing order, I ruled that I had no option but to order the stranger to withdraw, and thereupon, in order to get your ruling on the point, the committee have reported progress. </para>

                    <para>- I may inform the House that on several occasions attention has been called to two facts. One is that the space in the Speaker's gallery is not quite sufficient on occasions when interesting debates are proceeding, and that it would be a great convenience if, in addition to the space at the far end of the chamber, there was some space outside the House available at this end. The other fact to which attention has been called, as put by the Minister for Home Affairs, is that any officer of Ministers when seated in the Speaker's gallery is inaccessible for the purpose of the business of the House, and that if such officer could find a seat, not in the House but outside the House at this end, it would facilitate public business. With a view to that being done, I arranged this morning that some brass standards should be fixed, and a division of a technical kind made, so that the space behind the level of the screen, at the back of the chair, should be considered outside the House, the space not only behind the screen but beyond the ends of the House on either side. So soon as the technical divisional line is fixed, that will be clearly, in the opinion of all honorable members, outside the House, and therefore not within the operation of the standing orders. I would suggest to the House that, in the absence of such dividing line, any one sitting in that space is on the floor of the chamber, and therefore can be directed to withdraw under the standing order, and that pending the erection of the dividing line, no notice be taken of any one sitting there. </para>

                    <para>- I was responsible for attention being called to this matter, and back the explanation which you, sir, have just made been given previous to the sitting, I think there would have been no trouble at all. I am perfectly satisfied so long as the privileges of honorable members are preserved. I regret, however, to hear that it has been considered necessary to remove the book-case, as it was always a useful place of reference. I might also say that the space behind the chair has been used in times past by honorable members to carry on necessary conversation without irritating those who are carrying on the debate, or interfering with the progress of business in the Chamber. But if the exigencies of Ministers are such that it is absolutely necessary that an officer should be within easy reach of the Minister at the table, I can say nothing further. I am only too glad at any time to do all in my power to assist the progress of business. At the same time, I would remark that it is a good many years since this Chamber was built, and this certainly is the first time that any Minister of State has found it necessary to have an officer so near at hand as on the present occasion. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, there is all the more reason to give the power to transfer or promote a clerical officer to the professional division. If he is efficient, and his competency must be tested in the way the Minister suggests, then there can be no objection to giving, in regard to promotion from the clerical to professional division, similar power to that given in the converse case. That measure of justice is provided in the Victorian Acts. </para>

The whole structure of the Bill is to encourage people to aspire to get to the top, and if any one in the clerical division can qualify for the professional division, there ought not to be anything in the Bill to debar him from doing so. </para>

                        <para>- I think it ought to be, seeing that it is only on examination. It would be only fair to extend it to all the States, and I shall give the honorable member any assistance in my power to enable the transfers to be made, so far as I can see at present, unless the Minister shows the contrary. May I point out that clause 35 does not deal with transfers on examination, but deals with transfers without examination absolutely. </para>

                    <para>- The view that I have previously expressed I . desire to put before the committee in a concrete form by moving an amendment. I hardly know the best way in which to do this, but I wish to give the Governor-General power to transfer or promote an officer from the clerical, division to fill a vacancy in the professional division if such officer is competent and consents to such promotion. There are many gentlemen in the clerical division who are really professional men, but simply because they are in the clerical division the Governor-General has no power to put them into a position which they are competent to fill. It is within, the discretion of the permanent head, the commissioner, and the Governor-General to say whether any officer shall be promoted. But we know that there are members of the clerical division who have qualified themselves by examination to be professions!! men, and I see no reason why, when a vacancy occurs in the professional division, they should not be eligible to fill it, Under this clause there is no power in such a. case to transfer them from the clerical to the professional division, although there is power under the Bill to transfer an officer from the general division to the clerical division. I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me unnecessary so far as this clause is concerned, that the officer shall have passed the examination. I have been looking at the clause from the point of view that it is not laid down that a man shall have to pass another examination. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Indi, that we ought to give the same opportunities to the clerical division as are given to the professional division. We ought also to give the same advantages to the members of the general division. We must not make any distinction between the various divisions of the service. We want to throw the whole service open to any man in the ranks. We must not give privileges to the professional and clerical divisions which we do not give to the general division. If it is right that power should be given to promote an officer from either the clerical or the professional division, it is equally just that a similar power should be given to promote an officer from the general division. There should be no barrier to the advancement of an)' officer altogether irrespective of the particular division to which he belongs. I believe that it will be necessary to insert another sub-clause giving the Governor-General power to transfer or promote an officer from the general division to the clerical or professional division. As soon as the amendment before the committee is disposed of I shall move in that direction. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Indi is unnecessary, because clause 27 Says that before an appointment can be made to the special or professional division from outside the service certain requirements have to be complied with. It appears to me that the honorable and learned member for Indi is attempting to bring in a clause by which an officer may be brought from the clerical to the professional division. I think the amendment is surplusage. It is already inferred that a person must be taken from the clerical to the professional division unless strong reasons are given why the transfer is not made. If clause 27 does not imply that, there is really no reason by which an appointment can be made to the special division. The only definite power given to appoint any person at all is provided for in clause 27. There are no words giving any authority for an appointment to a professional division. It must be inferred that it is a general authority which is left to the Governor-General in Council. I think that we ought to strengthen the clause somewhere, but I do not think it is necessary to do so in the way that the honorable and learned member for Indi indicates. </para>

That division, which is the great administrative division, is one to which men may be drawn from all the other divisions of the service if they possess the necessary qualifications. These are the chief officer's who rise to the summits of their various divisions in the service, and who are naturally chosen from them to act as heads of departments. Some of the heads of departments come from the clerical division, and some come from the professional division, and some may have come from the general division, but they require first of all to have passed either the clerical or the professional examinations. </para>

                        <para>- We provided for that last night. The general division includes that vast nondescript body of employes in which a certain amount of manual skill is often required ; but beyond manual skill and physical capacity and average intelligence nothing more is required. If a man pursues his studies in some particular direction and rises out of the general into the professional division, he ceases to become an officer of the general division and becomes a professional division officer. Men in the general division With such qualifications can pass into the two higher divisions, and take up the highest administrative positions. I suppose the highest salary in the general division would be £200 or £300 a year ; and surely an electrical engineer of high attainments would be in receipt of a higher salary than that. </para>

                        <para>- I have already stated that it must be dealt with in the clause providing for regulations covering the professional division and which lias not yet been passed. But as these regulations will have to be laid before Parliament, that will be the time to challenge them. The provision that the honorable member for South Australia indicates, does not, I admit, appear in the Bill, and the proposal he now makes must be nugatory. This clause is not intended to afford any means of evading the ordinary conditions attached to promotion at all, but is designed to allow that interchange between the departments, which is so necessary to secure efficiency and effectiveness and to deal with such advancement as does not require an examination. The word "promote" is perhaps responsible for some misapprehension on this subject. This was regarded as a convenient clause for gathering together certain powers which are essential to the general administration of the service, and they are not intended to affect the general framework of the Bill or its requirements relating to promotion or transfer. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, under clause 37 there is to be no promotion from one class to a higher class unless an officer passes an examination. I understand that there are officers who, under the State law, would have been entitled to pass from class to class, although exempted from examination. I should like the Minister to inquire into the matter. </para>

                    <para>- Of course all the rights which officers had under the State law were carried forward to the positions which they now occupy. If, in the State service, they could go into another department or be transferred without examination, I am not quite sure whether that privilege was transferred with them to the Commonwealth, but whatever rights they had I think should continue. If the State would allow them to go from one department into another, I do not see why the Commonwealth should not do the same. If the honorable and learned member will let this point rest - it has just cropped up - I shall have inquiry made. </para>

                        <para>- I want to follow up that principle. The amendment which I now submit is in the terms of a clause which was moved when the last Public Service Bill of Victoria was before Parliament. The clause was lost on the advice of the Government, and the result has been that the Act has affected most injuriously a number of most deserving men. As a consequence of this, there has been a kind of federation amongst the public servants of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria, who desire that such a clause as I have now moved should be inserted in the Bill. It does not interfere in any way with the merit provisions of the Bill, but merely gives a guarantee to officers generally that no junior will be appointed where a senior is equally capable of performing the duties. I could, if I chose, take up a great deal of time to prove what I have said as to the dissatisfaction in the service, but I do not think "it is necessary to do so. </para>

                    <para>- It is too arbitrary. I thought when it came to a question of the removal of an officer from one part of the Commonwealth to another - say from the post office at Coolgardie, to the post-office at the Richmond River, New South "Wales - that it would not be the Minister who would order it, but the commissioner. It is just here that political influence comes in. If a permanent head has a grudge against a man - and there are such things - he may make that man's life unbearable by saying - " You must go off to a certain distant part of the Commonwealth." On the other hand, a Minister, if he is cajoled sufficiently, may remove an officer from a hot climate like that of Coolgardie to a pleasant place like Geelong </para>

I think that this sub-clause needs reconstruction. We must at least make it consistent, and say that an officer must obey either the Minister or the permanent head of his department, and not both. </para>

                        <para>- I think even then that the provisions of the clause will conflict. It is quite possible for the Minister to order the removal of an officer within the Postal department from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and for a permanent head to order removal in a different direction. It would be impossible for an officer to comply with conflicting orders. I think that in regard to the penalty to be imposed in case of disobedience the word "may" should be substituted for "shall" in regard to dismissal. </para>

                    <para>- Would it not be well to insert a provision by which a man would be allowed the option of appealing to the commissioner Why should not a man be allowed to decline a change if he finds, after looking at the circumstances of the case, that it is desirable so to do ? This question of removals gives rise to great trouble in the departments. Of course -I recognise that there may be a great many conditions connected with a man's circumstances, such, for example, as his health, or the health of his wife and family,- which ought fairly to be taken into consideration. The work of the State must be carried on, and a man ought not to be allowed from a mere whim or caprice to decline removal" from one place to another. But he ought to be allowed to go to the commissioner in order that an arbitrary injustice mr not be done. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest something more drastic because there is nothing more disheartening to a man in his work than to feel that a great proportion of his salary is to go away to others, and I think the King's service cannot be properly performed by men who are working to pay their creditors. I happen to know that there are in the various States a very large number of public servants who are going about with a weight of debt around their necks, and some of them with orders that they must pay a proportion of their salaries away every month to satisfy their creditors. I will refer to this matter later on. </para>

                    <para>- I doubt very much whether this clause will be effective. It seems to me that the draftsman has simply adopted provisions which have been in force in the various States, and has attempted ' to apply them to the circumstances of the Commonwealth. The dealing with officers who have been guilty of offences, will be very much more difficult under the circumstances of the Commonwealth service than would be the case in one of the States. In the case of the State service a man may be brought to head-quarters or the board of inquiry may be sent to the place where he is stationed, to make inquiry and deal with him on the spot, but when the large area of the Commonwealth has to be covered inquiry cannot be conducted so readily. I see that this clause provides that a number of charges may be brought against a man, but. that the chief officer has no power beyond that of reprimand . or caution, and the whole question whether a man is to be punished is carried entirely beyond him. The chief officer is the man who will really know more than any one else. He will be the real working head of the department, because the permanent head will probably be mostly in attendance on the Minister, or engaged in attending to the routine work of the department, and will not come much in contact with the officers. If in every case the routine of a board of appeal has to be gone through, there will be great delay and enormous expense, and there will be frequent suspensions extending over long periods which will prove very costly in so far as they will involve enforced idleness of officers on full pay. It seems to me that the chief officer ought to have more authority. If a serious offence is committed he has to make a report, and the matter will eventually come before a board of inquiry, and after the board has completed its work it is left to the permanent head to impose a penalty, to the commissioner to reduce the officer, or the Governor-General to dismiss him, as the nature of the case may require. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I was going to suggest, because I think that otherwise many offences would be passed over without any punishment, on account of the delay and trouble that would be involved in bringing matters before a board of inquiry.

At the present time, many officers are charged with offences about which* they are not able to learn any particulars, and it is quite possible for a man to have a charge worked up against him without knowing on what material it is based. It is not sufficient to give him a copy of the charge, but he should also be furnished - with a copy of the evidence against him. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that the provision is necessary. Any person who has experience of the courts knows the way in which a large number of public servants constantly refuse to pay their debts. The unfortunate position in regard to the creditors of public servants is that the King cannot be garnished, consequently the only way in which one can get at a public servant is by means of a defraud summons. I know men in the public service of Victoria - and I suppose it is the same in other States - who have come up and acknowledged in their examination on a defraud summons that they have had eight or nine orders, every one meaning that the person was guilty of fraudulent conduct. An order is made only because of previous fraudulent conduct, for no one can have an order for imprisonment made against him now, except on the ground of fraud. It is a disgraceful state of things to exist. It means that tradesmen are defrauded. Decent public servants do not want this state of things to continue, because they have extra work imposed upon them by the other men attending the courts. It is a constant scandal . in the public departments that some men do frequently neglect to pay their debts. I feel that I am on proper lines because I was asked last night by a number of public servants to propose such a provision. I move- </para>

                        <para>- I do not think three members are enough, because in important cases it might be necessary to have five or seven members. In connexion with this clause, I intend afterwards to consent to the insertion of the words, " and one of whom shall be the representative of the division to which such officer belongs, and elected by the officers of that division under the regulations," I do not know that there is very much in the matter at all, and did not think there would be any objection raised, or I should not have occupied the time with this discussion. This will be a matter for the discretion of the chief officer, and the amendment would make it quite certain that the employes would have a representative among a number on the Board and that it would not consist of one individual. </para>

If he does, and the amendment he carried, the representation of the employes on the board will be less than a third. The intention I had in giving notice of the amendment which the Minister has just intimated he is going to accept, providing for a representative of the division on the board, would be defeated, and the whole effect nullified and lost. We desire that the representation of the employes on the board should be one-third of the total representation. </para>

I know two or three public servants whom the very charge against them has so unstrung that they were utterly unfitted to appear, and I am quite sure that those cases would have had a different termination if they had not been allowed to employ representatives. I have in my mind the case of a young man who was completely exonerated on the charge made, against him, but who, had he been dependent on his own resources, would have got into trouble. This is a very wise provision, decidedly of advantage to officers against whom charges may be made. </para>

Within the last three months I was asked to appear, on behalf of one public servant, in the State of Queensland, and I know that the very fact that I had been nominated had the effect of causing a very much closer investigation to be held than would otherwise have been the case.

                    <para>- I heartily indorse what has been said by the honorable member for Moreton with regard to the right of an accused public servant to know what evidence is being brought against him. In all our criminal courts there is either a preliminary inquiry, at which the accused learns the character of the evidence, or else he is told what witnesses are to be called, and what they are to attempt to prove. ThE object of all systems of procedure in civil cases is to let the parties come to an issue, and have a general idea of each other's case. To put a public servant in the position of being told that he is charged with having committed a certain offence, and of having to come before the board knowing nothing of the circumstances - when the words of the charge may be wide enough to cover a score of sets of circumstances - is to treat him in a very unfair manner. He should be entitled to know not only what the technical words of the charge' are, but something more. ' For example, let us suppose that an officer is charged under clause 40 with being habitually negligent in the discharge of his duties. How can he know what he has to meet under those words ? They may cover the whole term of his service, or they may refer to some act that he has committed, or to something which he has neglected to do. In all fairness an officer is entitled to know the circumstances which constitute the general accusation brought against him, and therefore he ought to have some reasonable knowledge of the facts that are alleged against him in order that he may be prepared to meet them. A man may be charged with doing a certain thing, and may be able to call evidence to show that he did not do it, but he might not be able to call that evidence unless he knew beforehand what the charge was. I ask the Minister to think over this matter. On further consideration I am sure he will find that my suggestion is only consonant with the principles of fail' play which we find throughout the whole of our law. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable member for South Australia will withdraw his opposition to the clause, because it seems to me to be only just that an officer against whom a charge is made should have the right to be represented by counsel. There might be technicalities in an Act which the officer, as a layman, would not understand, and which would need the services of a lawyer or some educated man to unravel. I also think that there may be a certain amount of timidity on the part of an officer if he is called upon to appear personally before a board to give evidence in such an inquiry. </para>

He should have the' right to demand that the inquiry shall be conducted in private, in which case the result only need be given to the world. </para>

                        <para>- I think- that might be done under regulations. But I would point out to the honorable and learned member that it is sometimes absolutely essential that an inquiry should be conducted in public for the sake of the department. To give the right to an accused public servant to demand that the inquiry shall be held privately is not quite the proper thing. I admit that there ' might be regulations framed to allow of such an inquiry being held in private if the commissioner or Minister agreed to that course being adopted. But it would not be wise to give an absolute right to the accused to say that the inquiry should not be open to the press. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Minister for Home 'Affairs has taken the correct stand. We must not forget that these' are public affairs, and that the public have a right to know what is being done in regard to their own business. There may be cases which, from other considerations, ought to be conducted in private. It may be well that power should be given to have inquiries conducted in private by the consent of all parties interested, but to lay down the rule that an officer may demand an inquiry in private would be to overlook the fact that we are dealing with public concerns. </para>

                        <para>- There are plenty of members of this House who know that that is their experience. Where a man has been improperly charged with an offence and found innocent it is very easy indeed to take measures to prevent the publication of the proceedings if he so desires. On the other hand there is a large number of cases, which as the honorable and learned member for Indi has pointed out, should be inquired into in public. The matters involved are of a public character, and it is right that the public should have an opportunity of judging. The fact of the public being given that opportunity would also act in such a way as to protect the officer charged. It would do away with the star-chamber business. In the past there has been too much of private' reports in the public service. When I entered the Education department in Melbourne, I found that there was the principle of secret reports by inspectors, which reports the employes were never allowed to see except when a charge was made against them, and then only by applying to the Public Service Board. This system was carried out under regulations, and has since been abolished. Some of the officers after its abolition unearthed reports about themselves of years' standing - reports of which they knew nothing. There is always a great danger to the public service in having private reports given, and I think that the honorable member will be well advised if he withdraws his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- It has often occurred that a man has been brought before a board of inquiry, and although he has not been completely condemned he has been virtually condemned in the service for some time to come, and it therefore seems to me that the Government ought to provide officers with counsel to assist them in defending themselves. If the}' will not do that they ought to agree if the officer is acquitted to pay the expenses connected with his defence. </para>

We have had experience of what may be done in some cases with a man when he is in a helpless position, and we know that some people think that the right time to kick a man is when he is down. We ought to do something to help civil servants when they are in trouble, because they have not much money as a rule.

                    <para>- In view of the fact that a civil servant in some remote part of' the Commonwealth might be summoned before a board in Melbourne or Sydney, then undoubtedly, if he be found guiltless of a malicious charge lodged against him by a superior officer, he should receive some compensation for his expenses.' I hope the Minister will take a favourable view of this matter, because it is quite possible for the head of the department or a chief officer occasionally to have a prejudice against a man, and even to go so far as to lay a charge against him. With regard to the proposal that these inquiries should be held with open doors, I am not inclined to support that view, because we know very well that the sensational newspapers will have their reporters at such boards of inquiry; and if an officer should be charged with disgraceful or improper conduct the evidence will go forth day by day to the public, and give malicious and vindictive people an opportunity to come forward. In cases of this kind evidence could be manufactured against civil servants which should not be admitted at such inquiries. If a man is to be tried, he should be tried upon what the head of the department is able to prove, and there should be no fishing inquiries or any encouragement offered </para>

                    <para>- I do not think it would be right to give the option to the individual, because if it is in the interests of the community that there should be publicity, the inquiry should be held in public, notwithstanding the feelings of the individual concerned. I strongly support the proposal that the accused person should be supplied with all the reports relating to his conduct. I see that by sub-clause (2) the officer is to be supplied with a copy of the charge, but in addition to that he ought to know on what material those who are acting, against him are working, and he ought to be put in the same position so far as knowledge is concerned as his accusers. I think it would be well if the board had power to issue a certificate as to what costs and expenses should he allowed in connexion with any cases brought before them. I can understand that there are some cases in which a man ought to pay some of the expenses to which he has put the Crown, and on the other hand there are cases in which it would be egregiously unfair to put a civil servant to the expense of bringing witnesses from the far parts of the Commonwealth without allowing him one penny towards his expenses. It would answer the purpose if the Minister were to provide that the board might certify what costs and expenses should be allowed. </para>

Then, in reference to the expenses, I propose that the board can recommend as to expenses and certify ; they cannot decide, but they can recommend. </para>

                        <para>- That is all that is wanted. There is one little thing in the matter of drafting to be mentioned. There is provision made that the Board of Inquiry is to consist of three persons. One is to be the chairman, and any two of them are empowered to exercise the powers of the board. These two may not include the chairman. Under clause 10 the chairman is to have the same powers as the commissioner or inspector, which will include the power to administer an oath. It is only the chairman who has that power, and if by any chance he should be absent, I think it will be found that there is no power to administer the oath. The Acts Interpretation Bill, if it is passed in its present form, will provide in' clause 35 that certain tribunals which have power to hear and determine matters may administer an oath. The board has no power to do anything but to form an opinion and report. </para>

                <para>The clause will then go on to read just as it is printed. At this stage I do not propose to say anything about the provisions of the clause as they stand, except to point out that in the first place the Government propose that every probationer, before the confirmation of his appointment, is to assure his life. That seems to me to be playing into 'the hands of assurance companies to an unnecessary degree, because if a man were not appointed he would have been compelled to take out a policy on his life, which, perhaps, he would not have done had he known that he was not going to be permanently appointed. I think that to be unfair. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps that may cover the objection I have raised. I think it would be unfair to compel a man to take out an assurance on his life unless there was a reasonable chance of his being permanently appointed. I am not quite sure whether the provisions in sub-clause (c) are possible of attainment at all ; but we must wait, I suppose, to hear what the Government have to say on this question. What I desire the committee to determine is whether the Government are to carry on an assurance business or whether we are to permit private or mutual companies, as has been the case in the past, to do the assurance work of the civil service. I. think it is quite proper for the Government to propose to render it compulsory for every servant joining the Commonwealth service to take out an assurance on his life. The object of that provision, of course, is to do away with the necessity of an old-age pension system such as we have been used to in some of the States. I think it is a much better provision than the finding of a sum of money out of the consolidated revenue for paying pensions to civil servants when they retire ; and to that extent I think the proposal for assurance is acceptable. Inasmuch as the Government propose, rightly I think, to make it compulsory there ought to be some sort of guarantee to those who are thus compelled to assure their lives that the amounts for which they are assured, or the annuities which they hope to receive, shall be paid to them. Luckily, over the whole of this Commonwealth most of the assurance companies doing any considerable business are conducted on the mutual principle, and I do not recollect any company which has ever failed to meet its obligations. I must be fair to that extent. At the same time, cases have occurred in other parts of the world where companies have not kept their' engagements in this regard, and where persons being assured with them have not received the benefits which they ought to have received had the companies been better managed financially. I feel, therefore, that the principle of compulsion on the part of the servant ought to involve the principle of guarantee on the part of the Government.

                        <para>- I would prevent them dealing with the annuities in any way which would tend to take away from them the regular amount which they stipulated to receive on making the contract. I believe in the annuity system, and for the reason that the men are benefited to a greater extent than by a lump sum of money. The proposal will not prevent men in the service of the Government from contracting outside for the sake of their wives and families for the payment of a large sum of money on their death or at some fixed period. We are all familiar with the system wisely adopted in connexion with banking and other companies. I believe the Bank of New South Wales has a splendid system of annuities for the bank servants on retirement at a certain age. There are other private companies, which I do not wish to advertise, but which also adopt this particular method for retiring servants. I think we could not do better than take pattern and example from the very excellent results which these companies and corporations have' achieved. As a last instance I may cite what I believe is. the South Australian experience. From what I know of that experience the Government some years ago guaranteed a fund of this kind by paying . into it a sum of £10,000, though I speak from memory and under correction. This fund is contributed to by the servants of the State upon an actuarial scale and along well known lines, and I believe the guarantee has never been asked for or required in any direction. The public servants of the State have achieved for themselves excellent results, and altogether there does not appear to be the slightest intention of departing from the system, the disposition being rather to strengthen it, and, if possible, to make it more extensive. Honorable members from South Australia will probably be able to speak with more authority than I can on this question, but I believe the facts which I have stated broadly and generally will be found to be correct on closer scrutiny and investigation. What has been done in a State might very well be done in the Commonwealth.. If the experience of South Australia, Germany, and other 'places has been so entirely successful, we here, just initiating a new system for a new nation, may very well take advantage of the experience of other countries, and give to the servants of the Government the proper guarantee that they ought to receive and initiate a new system of insurance altogether. But I do not advocate the system purely for that reason. I am a believer in monopolies of this kind being taken in hand by the State itself. That being so I might have advocated the proposal under any circumstances, but in view of the experience of other places, and of the apparent success which attends the system elsewhere, I am the -more emboldened to put this proposal forward in the hope of getting it adopted at the initiation of the new state of affairs in connexion with the Commonwealth. Honorable members would probably remind me, if I did not introduce the subject-matter myself, of the New Zealand State Life Assurance department. In that colony a very great advance has been made in the matter of life assurance.- It has been very progressive in all matters of social legislation, but in the matter of State life assurance I think it has been much more successful than perhaps some honorable members are aware. From the official records of various kinds that I have been enabled to peruse, I find that the department was first founded in 1870. From that time up to the present some £8,000,000 sterling has been received in premiums from various persons assuring their lives with this department of State. I find further that the total number of policies issued by all the companies of New Zealand, inclusive of the State Assurance department, is 75,692. Of that very great number of policies, however, the Government department has no less than 39,366, or considerably more than half. So successful has been this particular department of State that, as the honorable member for Echuca has just now pointed out to me, it practically discourages the other companies. </para>

                        <para>- I have nothing to say on that point at present. New Zealand is, per unit of population, the most heavily assured country in the world. It would be idle and a waste of time to go into great detail as to other matters connected with this department of State, but from the success of the institution there is very little likelihood of its ever being put on one side, and private companies and mutual companies taking its place. The people of New Zealand have learned to realize and appreciate the splendid guarantee which the Government have behind their undertakings. To such an extent do the people appreciate the system that out of a total of 75,000 odd policies there are assured with the department nearly 40,000. </para>

                        <para>- Reversionary bonuses. The only comment which either private companies or mutual companies make is that the bonuses paid by the New Zealand State department are not so great or high as those paid by mutual companies in New Zealand or - I speak under correction - in any case- in Australia. But the answer to that comment is, and it seems to be quite effective, that if the bonuses are not so high neither are the premiums so high. The premiums are lower in every case, and there are not so many of the hampering conditions attached to the State policies as are attached to most of the policies issued by mutual or private companies. The concern is looked on in a business-like way, and conducted on sound actuarial lines, and is, so far as I am able to judge, a most successful institution. The investments of the department in New Zealand are limited, and properly limited, to municipal and national securities, and to that extent assurers are further safeguarded. These remarks give as briefly as I could possibly give, without taking up more time than is necessary, some indication of the success with which this department has been inaugurated and carried on in New Zealand. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that in such a contingency the Government would have to make the position right for the individual servants concerned. That, is to my mind, the great argument that may be used against the life insurance principle. Still, I think that if the schedule is carefully prepared, it is a very remote contingency. Certainly, we have to choose now between the proposal of the Government and a pension fund created by the State. The pension fund would need to have a large amount of money placed to its credit to put it upon a sound actuarial footing. I do not agree with the honorable member for Bourke that there is an advantage in the small number that will first come under the provisions of the Bill, because the fact of our going to outside offices, in which there are .thousands and hundreds of thousands of policy holders, will enable us to start at once upon a sound basis, as if we had had for years a State assurance fund. I do feel more generally in this matter than the particular case might indicate, because I am a very strong upholder of the principle of life assurance. I believe it is a system which, if properly carried out, and if the people are indoctrinated with it, may save the country a very great many old-age pensions. I find that when once a man has taken out a policy of life assurance and sees the benefit of it, when he looks at the reversionary bonuses which are declared year after year, or at the quinquennial periods, he has a desire to put his savings into that particular kind of investment. I am sure I shall have the sympathy of honorable members when I say that if many of us had put our savings into that particular kind of instrument we would have been better off to-day than we are. Therefore, whilst I think that the question is very arguable, I am inclined to take it as an experiment. Of course an experiment seems rather dangerous in laying the foundation of a principle which must be carried on, probably for all time. Still I think that it is so sound in every way,, that it so meets the conditions of the public servant, and is such an incentive to saving, that it would be well if this House - whether it requires modifications or not I cannot say - would accept it. I do not mean life assurance under the State ; I do not mean a fund which is really a pension fund ; but the principle of every man assuring his life, on entering the public service, in a reputable office. Under a scheme like this, he would, as in any other condition of life, increase his assurance as the years went on, and provide, not merely an annuity, which would be practically the interest on the endowment, for himself, but a fund by which he would be assured that his widow would be left comfortably off. </para>

                        <para>- It has been found that, although the Government gave a guarantee when the fund was first started, no call upon them has ever been necessary, and ' the fund is now absolutely self-supporting, and so safely and securely established that it is able to stand alone. In addition to that I am informed that it is intended to extend the system to other branches of the service, so that the whole of the State servants may be brought under its provisions. I am one of those who believe that we should as far as possible provide for those who do the work of the State, and that we should not have the spectacle of men who have given the best years of their life to the public service being compelled in their old age to ask for charity. Under the scheme I have already spoken of the men themselves contribute, and the whole of the funds are provided by those who work in the department, and they have the sense of security which is so necessary to the satisfactory working of life assurance business. The acting leader of the Opposition allows at once that if we had a schedule of approved offices, and if any one of these offices became insolvent, there would be at least a moral obligation on the part of the Government to come to the assistance of those who had assured in the defaulting office ; but we could obviate all that by the Commonwealth taking the responsibility from the very start. </para>

                        <para>- I sincerely trust that I shall never see the State going in for an assurance business conducted on those lines. The only reason why State assurance should be established is in order that people may have opportunities of assuring their lives more cheaply, and that is the only direction in which they should get the benefit. I think State assurance could be undertaken with regard to the officers of the State with more advantage than by private companies, because there ought not to be the same expense connected with getting the policies taken up. No commissions would have to be paid, and in addition to that the State would be absolutely certain of receiving its payments, because there would be no dropping out, and no claims made upon the Government for " time to pay." The whole thing would be worked by deductions from the salaries paid to Government officers. This matter of State life assurance has been sufficiently investigated, and the results, both here and on the Continent, have been such as to warrant us in taking the step I have indicated. I should like to see the whole of the Commonwealth servants assured under a system backed up by the Commonwealth, and safer and cheaper than any other system possible. </para>

                        <para>- I believe in assurance companies having to certify that their accounts are in accordance with their balance-sheets. I do not think it would be possible to register assurance companies, but we all know what has taken place during the last few years, and I think it would be a good thing if the accounts of these companies were certified to as being in order. Whilst I quite agree with the necessity for some assurance arrangements, I think it would be a hard thing to compel the Government servants to assure in the Government fund and prevent them from going to societies which would, perhaps, give them better bonuses than the Government could do. </para>

                    <para>- I trust we are not going to be led into an academic discussion at this stage, because I do not think that the occasion is an opportune one. The remarks I had intended to make have been to some extent anticipated by the honorable member for Macquarie. I do not think that we can possibly look for success with a State assurance fund started just now. One of the matters that the Commonwealth has power to take up is that of assurance, and the whole* question as to whether officers should assure with the State or not can very well be left open to be dealt with at some future time, especially as some considerable period must elapse before any number of officers could join an assurance fund. If there is one tiling that the Australian people have reason to be proud of it is their mutual assurance companies, which passed absolutely unscathed through the recent financial crash. </para>

                        <para>- Where necessary they have recast their figures in order to make them more complete and sound. These premiums are not found by the State, but are deducted from the salaries of the officials. It is right, therefore, that for that investment which they are compelled by the State to make, they should get the best possible return. In the case of assuring with the Government they cannot possibly expect to get a return in the shape of profits for many years ; whereas, in the case of probably some half-dozen assurance companies the value of their policy will increase so considerably that, perhaps in 20 or 25 years, it will double itself. Why should we compel men to assure with the State and literally rob them of that additional profit which should come to them in their old age and to their children ? One other advantage I think will come to the public ill this matter. It has been said that we should allow assurers to select their own offices. We should give them that right, but at the same time we should have a list, and the Government should see that they accept only policies in assurance offices which they found on examination were sound and stable, and the general public would also have this benefit for' themselves. I agree to a certain extent with the previous speaker that the Government should keep a strict supervision over all assurance companies, because we have to take the figures as they are given to us. We have to take the figures as they are audited, and - the figures from their own actuaries ; but possibly there may be behind all that some weakness in the office of which the members should be made aware. If the State assurers ore to go into these mutual offices it will compel the Government, to keep a stricter check on those offices, and so to the whole public they will be made even safer than they are. </para>

                        <para>- They do it in America at the present time. I trust that we shall get a strict supervision both over assurance companies and over banks as soon as we get our legislative machinery into working order. I think Ave may accept the proposal of the Government at the present time. We should not go so very far in this direction but that we can retrace our steps. We may fairly leave the whole discussion, I think, until a more convenient season. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with the American companies, and when we arrive at a decision as to those companies 1 shall be prepared to give an expression of my opinion. Is it a preposterous thing to do ? I do not want to sound an alarmist's note, but let it be understood that there .are in Australia not merely mutual life assurance companies, but actually proprietary life assurance companies. Is it the object of honorable members to put civil servants at the mercy of men who are drawing dividends from the earnings of these assurance companies ? What is to prevent a proprietary assurance company from putting up its dividends from 10 to 20 per cent., and so absorbing its profits or reserves as to become in a short time in an unsound position ? </para>

                    <para>- I am not an authority. I do not profess to be an actuary or to understand the business of assurance ; I can only say that the volume of this company's business has grown wonderfully during the last five or six years. When we are starting out to build up a new nation, I do not think it is our duty to compel our civil servants to assure in these private companies. The honorable member for Wentworth, I believe, admitted that if there was any default on the part of these assurance companies the State had a moral obligation to make it good. If these companies are to offer any security to civil servants we must have a periodical examination of their mortgages and of their securities, in order to know how the}' stand, made by independent State auditors - men who will examine every document and every piece of paper representing a security with the companies. Look at the enormous expense ! </para>

I want it distinctly understood that what I say here on this matter is without prejudice. I want that to be understood for the simple reason that I have been twenty years an assurance man, and have made a fortune at the business. Having had a little experience, I want to say that if it is worth the consideration of the Government to give protection to 11,000 civil servants, surely honorable members in the State of Victoria all these years have not been doing their duty as regards the protection of the citizens of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I will not say a word about my company. I am going to talk about this matter altogether from the point of view of the Commonwealth of Australia. For myself I am here to do my duty to the people of the great State of Tasmania. The honorable member for Coolgardie quite rightly says that there are proprietary companies. I say that civil servants in general or in particular, or people in general, should not be thrown out in the cold world without a certificate of protection by. the Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth will have to absolutely enter into the business and put their canvassers on the road, and compete with public companies if the Government want to get any averages. </para>

                    <para>- Not exactly free. The members of every Legislature in this country are morally responsible for the family of every man who has insured his life in a company It is.said that tins guarantee cannot be given; but it is done in Canada, in the States of New York, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, and. almost every other State of the American Union. Surely in the United States nothing has been done that we cannot do here. Let us then begin aright, and compel every assurance company in the Commonwealth to come under State supervision. Let the Minister have a list of the companies and tell the civil servants the companies in which they must assure. These companies should then be compelled to deposit their legal reserve in Commonwealth Government debentures, and it should be seen that these reserves are sufficient to cover every policy, based on a reasonable calculation. That is "all that could be done if we had Government assurance. The amount invested in Commonwealth bonds, held by the Commonwealth, should be equal to the amount owing to the civil servants, and I am sure lots of splendid assurance companies could be found to come in and undertake the work. I will be prepared to move an amendment on the amendment to the effect that we should adopt another system, giving us the benefit of the companies established, and of companies able to get averages, and then we will not, perhaps, bankrupt the Commonwealth. There are not only averages in people but averages in countries in life insurance business, so that losses met with in one country are made up somewhere else. The officers of the Australian Mutual Provident Society were wise to see that was the case, and that is why they have struggled to get away to other countries besides Australia with their business. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened very carefully to the speech of the honorable member for the "great State of Tasmania," and I fail to see in anything he has said, although I believe he is an assurance expert, an argument to change me from my resolution to support the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke. I feel that it is a necessary corollary to compelling civil servants to assure that there should be a State assurance department. If a great reserve of coin is required in the case of private assurance companies, I do not consider that such a necessity exists in the case of the State. We have the whole State security behind a scheme of State assurance, and that I feel certain would be sufficient to commend it to the civil servants and even to the general public if the scheme were extended to embrace the latter. I do not think the scheme of State assurance can be described as an experiment. As the honorable member for Bourke has already indicated, we have instances of schemes of the nature being successfully carried on in the various States. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. If such a scheme can be carried on in the States, I' do not see why we have fewer chances of its success in the Commonwealth of Australia. There is another matter which I think worthy of consideration. The large expense of carrying on these private assurance companies has already been commented on, and I believe that -expense amounts in some cases to 75 per cent, of the profit. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. But in the case of civil servants there is no necessity for commission agents to go round to secure the necessary business. Why, then' penalize the civil servants to the extent which is necessary in the case of those companies who have to send their agents among the general community? I hope the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke will receive the careful consideration of the committee, and if that careful consideration be given, I am sure that the principle is one that many members will feel compelled to support. </para>

                        <para>- We claim to be able to legislate upon the matter of old age pensions, and we shall have to supply the means to enable any such system to be carried out. We therefore might as well tax the people to provide for their own old age. I shall certainly support the proposal of the honorable member for Bourke, believing it to be a step in the right direction. Though it may be a small thing at the beginning, it will continue to grow, and by the establishment of this system we shall do away with the evils that would otherwise develop into bigger evils as time passed. I am glad to see that the old fashioned pension scheme has not been followed. Among the subjects upon which the Commonwealth Parliament is empowered to legislate are assurance other than State assurance, and as the assurance of public officers and employes will extend beyond the boundaries of any one State we are quite within our rights in legislating upon this matter. I hope that the proposal of the honorable member for Bourke will command a majority in its favour. </para>

I propose that those who are already insured, and who come under the provisions of clause 43, shall retain their assurances with the companies as they now exist, unless they voluntarily choose to surrender their policies and come under the Government fund. But I wish to provide that those who are not already assured, and who come into the Commonwealth service, shall be compelled to come under the State Assurance Fund. The further proposals, of which I spoke, would have the effect of establishing a State Life Assurance department, which would allow the outside public, in addition to civil servants, an opportunity to come in. </para>

                        <para>- To be quite accurate in language, it is as much of the scheme as can be put into the Bill, but it is not a complete scheme. To complete it would require a Bill which will need the assent of both Houses of Parliament. The passing of a resolution in this House is a very long way from obtaining the desired result by legislation. I am entirely in sympathy with the idea contained in the amendment ; but I do not think it is a matter of such urgency as to compel us to pass it in this Bill during the present session, because for many years to come there will be a very small number of. individuals affected by this assurance provision. The bulk of the public servants of the Commonwealth will belong to the transferred departments, who are expressly exempted from the provisions of the Bill. Honorable members must recollect that a life assurance society, in order to be satisfactory to its members - even if it be purely mutual - must be a living and growing body. At a certain stage in its early life there comes a period when the liabilities begin to accrue ; when the debts have to be paid ; and unless it then has an increasing business so as to .enable it from its revenue to pay the debts on the deaths, that society from- a financial point of view is doomed. I ask the honorable member for Bourke if he anticipates that this ' scheme will be self-supporting, and. will not require contributions from the consolidated revenue to enable it to live. The honorable member may tell me that it will be self-supporting if we bring in the public, but we ma)' not be able to bring in the public. We have no guarantee that we shall get our system of Commonwealth life assurance. </para>

                        <para>- But I- would point out that even probationers die. The death rate may be very small. I do not suppose however, that it will be much less than the death rate of any first class life assurance society already in existence. It will not be so vastly improved a death rate as to make a difference to the fact that there will not be premiums coming in. It will take a lot of premiums to stand even a moderate assault. </para>

                        <para>- My own view is that the insertion of these provisions would be more likely to hinder the establishment of State life assurance than to assist it. There are other things which might very well be branches of the same subject in a State having only a limited range, so to speak, such as our own fidelity guarantees, assuring our own properties, and working these in connexion with the flotation and management of our loans, and applying them to the investment of locally floated loans, etc. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, creating a department which I, for one, am not afraid to anticipate. But I am frankly afraid of the responsibility which might be involved if we did not get the outside public to come in. It is hardly fair to the committee, to the Parliament, or to the Commonwealth to settle a big issue like this in a debate on a subject like a Public Service Bill, which is primarily devoted to the determination of very different questions. I am' still in a state of flux, so far as my mind is concerned, on the matter, but I submit these considerations, with the hope that other honorable members may be able to help me to come to a decision as to which way I should vote. 1° have still an open mind in the matter, but there are difficulties which I think it is the bounden duty of the supporters of the proposal to remove before they can expect my support. </para>

                    <para>- When we were on the second reading of this Bill I expressed the opinion that the assurance of civil servants of the Commonwealth should be undertaken by the Commonwealth itself, directly, and not through the assurance companies ; and, further, that, as is provided in exceptional instances under clause 49, so should it be provided in all instances, that is to say, that the Commonwealth should be responsible for the granting of satisfactory gratuities and allowances to all civil servants coining within the scope of these particular clauses or. their death or retirement from the service. Inasmuch as these clauses cannot embrace all the servants who are transferred to the Commonwealth at the present time, who are specially exempted under clause 43, I do not think we need apprehend any great difficulties from death or disaster for some years to come, or before we have built up a fund upon which those retiring or the dependents of those dying may rely with the assurance that they will get the relief intended to be provided, for them. I can see no serious objection to, but on the other hand I can see every good reason for, the State subsidizing a fund of that sort in order to provide for the comfort of its own servants. I hope that any prospect of difficulty will not daunt us or prevent us from passing the measure; which, I believe, will be attended with incalculable good to the servants of the Commonwealth. We have in some of the States provision of this sort already, and provision has been made in some way or other for the great majority of the servants of the transferred services, and I think it now becomes our bounden duty to see that provision is made for their future. I am afraid I am in disagreement with some of those who favour this State assurance idea, inasmuch as I. would, limit it strictly to making provision for our own servants, and would not go to the general public for assistance in establishing the' fund, and thus make the Commonwealth Government a general assurance company. I would limit it solely to the operations necessary to be conducted on behalf of our own servants. </para>

It is said to be actuarially sound, and therefore we have that much to go on. If the scheme itself is actuarially sound, and the private companies are prepared to accept it, what should there be to prevent the Government from taking it up ? We know that a considerable percentage of the earnings of the companies goes in the way of expenses, in payment of agents' commissions, directors' fees, cost of buildings, and so on. </para>

                        <para>- It is not at all unlikely that other services beyond those already transferred will be taken over by the. Commonwealth, and this fund will probably prove the nucleus of a very" large scheme into which the outside public may be eventually drawn, if necessary. We are telling the public servants that they must assure their lives, and if we require that they shall assure their lives with some of the private companies, it argues that the Government must guarantee the companies. We have no right to say to our servants that they must assure unless we are prepared to give a guarantee that their policies will be met. If we do have to guarantee these companies, it seems to me that we shall ultimately have the responsibility, and that being so, I think we ought to do the work itself. It would be idle to say that the Government should bear all the losses, but that if there were any profits, they should go into the hands of the private companies. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot say that I have not been interested in the debate, for it has been most interesting. I quite disagree with the assertion that there would be any difficulty, or that there would be any loss, in reference to this proposal. It is quite different of course from bringing in a proposal to deal with general assurance. I .admit that if in New South Wales the actuarial reports had given a proper basis for what approaches the present proposal, the Superannuation Fund would not be so insolvent as it is. I admit that there is nothing to prevent this thing from being done, but it is a very large question, which I do not wish to see decided in a hurried manner, either in a very small committee or after a short debate. If we postpone the consideration of this part of the Bill after the interesting debate which we have had, and which has thrown considerable light on the question, it will give us a little more time to consider what is the best course to take. .My own feeling, up to the present time, has been strongly in favour of the provisions of the Bill, but I am quite prepared to consider fairly this proposal, and therefore I shall ask for a postponement of Part IV. until we deal with the other parts of the Bill. I have applied to various assurance companies for information regarding this matter, but I have not had any replies. I want to have that information before I deal with the question in reply to the arguments which have been used tonight. I think I am justified in asking for a postponement, because the debate on this amendment has taken a turn which I was scarcely prepared for it to take. I am not speaking in any hostile spirit to the honorable member for Bourke. I want to deal fairly with the whole question, and therefore I move- - </para>

If the amendment of the honorable member for Bourke is carried when it comes on again,of course this matter will not be dealt with; but, if it is not carried, I intend either to agree to the proposal of the honorable member for Tasmania, or to make a proposal which will coincide very much with it, because I think it is a wise thing to provide for those who may be left by civil servants. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will look at the Constitution Act he will see that there is not the slightest ground for apprehension. The Constitution plainly says that any such officer shall be entitled to the pension or retiring allowance which would be permitted by the law of the State if his services. with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his services with the State. No words could possibly be plainer than these. The pension in the case of Victoria, for instance, will be on the salaries the officers were receiving in their last three years in the service of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- In one. case there is a scale ona3per cent. basis, while in another it is 4 per cent. It seems tome that it might be right and generous on the part of the Commonwealth to consider whether some scheme could not be worked out by which this disparity should cease to exist. I think it would make the public service more easy and prevent much heartburning if a scheme were adopted by which, where the burden is at present heavier, it might be reduced to on average. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that. To the best insurance companies they probably pay 4 per cent., but to others they may pay more. All our Victorian. officers since 1880 are providing for their own future. It will only be in connexion with the long service men, who joined the service before 1880, that tho discrepancy which, the honorable member for Wentworth has spoken of, will arise. But even that is one of the discrepancies which it may be possible for the commissioner in the course of time, when he has a view of the circumstances of all the States, to harmonize. </para>

                        <para>- But I wish to point out that it may happen that there is no compensation provided for under the State law. Will the Government regard the length of service that has been devoted to the State, and take the matter of compensation into consideration irrespective of what the law may be upon the subject? Otherwise, I believe that in some cases officers would receive no compensation, even although they had been in the State service for several years. These cases I should like to be considered by the Commonwealth. </para>
