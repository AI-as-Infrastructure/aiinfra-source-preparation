At the same time I might say that any written communication on the subject forwarded to us we shall carefully consider, but deem it our duty not to discuss it at the present time. </para>

In Queensland there are eight Ministers, of whom.the Premier receives £1,300 a year and the others . £1,000 each. In that State there are also travelling expenses for members, with an annual allowance of £300, which is not paid to those who receive official salaries. In South Australia there are six Ministers at £1,000 each, and the member's allowance of, £200 a year is not paid during the tenure of office. In Tasmania there are four Ministers, with£750 each, with an allowance to members, included in the £750, of £100 a year. In Western Australia there are six Ministers, of whom the Premier gets £l,200and the other Ministers £1,000 each. I have been unable to get the Western Australian Act of last year, under which I believe provision for the payment of a salary to members was made. </para>

            <para>- I can give only a direction to the Ministry on financial measures. I cannot introduce estimates or financial proposals ; I can only by an abstract motion give direction to those in control of the finances. In England there are now twenty Cabinet Ministers - the largest Cabinet I believe there ever was in England. The second greatest office there - namely, that of the Lord President of the Council, has attached to it a salary of £2,000. The greatest professional, as well as the greatest parliamentary functionary - 'the head of the Navy of a nation which according to all admission, is supreme in naval matters, and whose flag streams to almost every breeze that sweeps the sea - -has a salary of £1,500 a year attached to .his office in addition to his professional salary of £1,825. In Canada there are thirteen ministers, of whom the Prime Minister gets £1,600 a year. </para>

            <para>- We are not likely to. If I can put my finger upon the pulse of Australian honesty, we are not likely to have here anything like what took place in Canada in 1885, in connexion with the transcontinental railway frauds. That, at any rate, is my diagnosis of Australian morality, which is not going to be affected by the payment of £400 a year more or less to Ministers. What we are considering is whether this is a departure we ought to make. In Canada there are thirteen Ministers. </para>

            <para>- The Federal Constitution departs from Australian practice, and the question is whether that is justifiable. I am considering the expediency of making this departure. We all have to make departures, and sometimes they are in the wrong direction, and sometimes in the right direction.

            <para>- I am not quite sure, because I am laying before the House the result of an incomplete research. There is an allowance for expenses in Canada, with a maximum of 1,000 dollars for a session.' So that the salary of a Minister is less in Canada, even if the parliamentary allowance be paid to him - on which point I am uninformed - than the salary allowed here. I was about to remark that Canada has resources equal to ours and a population quite as great, and that the Dominion calls for as much detailed administration and at present more detailed administration than does the Australian Federation. </para>

            <para>- The two great exceptions in England are, I believe, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, whose salaries and allowances last year totalled about £33,000. Rut some of the followers of the conservative Government are kicking against these high salaries, and the matter has been drawn attention to in the press. All I wish to say is that we should practice economy. We have no new sources of revenue. We have, according to the contention of some honorable members, which I do not altogether agree with, to rely for many years on Customs revenue, and that revenue is not likely to be increased until the people increase. The States, as a consequence of federation, will have to apply the pruning knife and go in for the reduction of salaries and retrenchment in some cases, and we ought to teach them an example by applying retrenchment to the offices at the top of the ladder. </para>

If' so, we shall need to have a financial statement as to the means of' Ministers. That factor should not enter into the consideration of this question. I say that at the inauguration of our national government there should be extreme delicacy in all our acts, and especially in an act involving the taking of' money for ourselves or for our Ministers. I have no hesitation in saying - speaking, of course, of the State which 1 know best, New : South Wales - that avery keen fight took place there over every question of expenditure embraced in the Constitution Act, and I. daresay the people. of the other States could also be spoken for by their representatives. It was very wellunderstoood in. New South Wales that the limit of the payment to Ministers was to be the £12,000 provided in the Constitution. It was never thought that there would be a departure from the system adopted in the different States, under which Ministers abandon their allowance as members when they receive their Ministerial allowance. </para>

            <para>- At any rate, the fact must be admitted that it is a departure from the custom, to which people in the other States have been used, and therefore likely to create an impression amongst the people of Australia that this Federal Parliament will not pursue a policy of economy, but will commit itself, when occasion arises, to a policy of inflation and extravagance. It is not the extra £2,800 that is involved. That is: nothing in the expenditure of the Commonwealth. But it is an indication to. the public of the direction in which the Commonwealth Parliament is likely togo when Ministers - having in. the Constitution Act the provision that they shall receive a . salary not- exceeding " £12; 000 a year, which does not mean that they shall get £12,000 - go to the extreme limit of that Act, and take £400 a year each in addition. In the interests of this Parliament, I think there should be great" delicacy about overstepping . the anticipations of- the people and going to the extreme bounds of the Constitution Act. I believe Ministers would do much to create that confidence which is so desirable in connexion with the first actions of the Commonwealth Parliament if they graciously agree - if, without talking a division on this matter, they find that there is considerable opposition in this House to the payment, quite irrespective of whether there is a majority against it or not - to waive the right to the allowance and to follow the custom which has been universally followed through* out the different States. </para>

            <para>- There is no necessity for an alteration of that section. The amount the Ministers are to receive could be fixed at £9,200 a year if Parliament chose.' There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent it. I certainly enter my protest against this new course of procedure, and I believe, as I have already said, that the Ministry will do something to encourage the confidence of the people in the Commonwealth- Parliament if they show that, whilst having the light to receive a larger remuneration, they are willing to accept the basis of remuneration which has been recognised in the-, different States. </para>

I take it that we have done all that is required of honorable men in giving the very first opportunity to this House to come to a decision on the subject. In order that that opportunity may be perfect and complete, Ministers do not propose to cast their own votes. </para>

            <para>- There may be some doubt as to whether we are baking the right course, and for the reason that if this matter is settled on the present motion the determination will affect the salaries of future as well as- of1' present Ministers. It is a matter of public policy, and, therefore, Ministers would nob be subject bo the parliamentary rule which forbids men from voting where their own financial interests are involved. At the same time, I reiterate that personally I shall not vote on this motion, and I think my -colleagues will follow my example. The question as to the future is not in one way so important as the question of' the present, for this reason : it is better that Ministers should not be under any imputation of self-seeking. The question of what salaries they are to receive from time to time isa question of the future as well as of the present, and can be settled at any time. I do not say that I do not feel some diffidence in addressing myself to this question. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and they receive sessional allowances ; but into that I do not wish to go. I am not arguing the question, but simply pointing out the facts. Reference has been made to the fact that in New South Wales there was a great protest against extravagance. I agree with the honorable member for North Sydney to this extent, that in the arguments over the referendum it was constantly contended that the new expenditure under the Commonwealth would be £750,000 a year, and it is to the opponents of federation that he really alluded. We know very well that the Finance Committee's estimate in Adelaide was £300,000 a year. In that estimate the salaries of 75 Members of Parliament were included - and that number of course covered every one of the Ministers - in addition to this sum of £12,000. Yet the total estimate came to about two-fifths of the amount which the enemies of the Bill put forward, and amongst them my honorable friend was not enrolled. At the same time we must not omit to remember that while it may be expected that in the course of years we shall reach something like that £300,000 a year, the ordinary expenses of the Commonwealth, apart from such matters as the inauguration of Parliament and the necessary military and social expenses entailed thereby, have been shown by the Treasurer to be at the rate of only £120,000 a year. The honorable member for North Sydney has referred to comments in New South Wales. I ask him if he heard at any meeting at which he attended - I attended every meeting that I possibly could on both those referendums - or whether he read in the newspapers any special comment on the question whether Ministers who did the work of Members of Parliament as well as of Ministers should receive nothing for the one service but all their remuneration for t he other? </para>

          <para>- I intend, to vote against the motion. It has always seemed to me that there is too great an appearance of economy on the part of those charged with the governing of institutions of this character, as opposed to what really is the essence of it, and so we find that while in order to catch the plaudits of the unthinking, who do not go into the necessary calculations in regard to work of this description a number of honorable members not only in this House, but in similar Chambers are willing to cut down the salaries of those who come most under the public eye, they agree, on the other hand, to most exorbitant salaries in cases not so subject to criticism. I have always, held the opinion that unless - even in State, affairs - -we are. prepared to make some reasonable recompense to men of high character and ability to take up positions of this sort, we cannot expect any large number of such persons to accept them. We can certainly get, I admit, many men who would come in and take the position of Minister at £1,000 a year, or even at £500 a year, and we can get many men who would offer themselves to electors, and be willing to come into this Chamber to do the work for nothing. But I ask, are we justified in placing the whole future, so far as the business of the country is concerned, in the hands of one class - those who can afford to give their time practically for nothing to the service, of the State. I maintain, even if that were desirable as a general principle, we have not that large leisured class to draw, upon in this young country, where every, person is concerned in making a living for himself, that they have in the old country. </para>

            <para>- It may be a good job, and I believe it is in some respects, but I admit that the politics of England have lost nothing in one aspect from the fact that they have that class to draw upon. For we find some of the most democratic, able, and radical men coming from the -ranks- of those who have made politics-a profession - that is, who do not need the pay, and have made politics a profession, as far as the study and understanding of political questions was concerned. But in this country every man practically speaking, is earning his livelihood in some shape or other, and is it fair to the best men from the political stand-point, that we should offer no inducement to them to take up politics, which would be done if we cut down the salaries that are to be paid to the various Ministers. </para>

            <para>- I do apply the same to members' salaries. I think the discussion which took place the other day with respect to members' salaries was somewhat out of order, it was not germane to the point under discussion, and I am not prepared at this stage to consider it, but I shall be prepared to vote for an increase in members' salaries in the next Parliament, believing that it will widen the choice of the electors. \V"e are considering what -is the proper sum to be paid to gentlemen who are asked to give up all their time to the service of the State. Taking the view which has been put forward as to what was intended by the Convention at Adelaide, I of course do not pretend to know the intention of honorable members who sat there, but I hold that this Parliament is a much more representative body than the Convention could be, with all respect to those of' whom it was composed, because we have been elected after this thing has been thrashed out, - after people had begun to know something of what the principles involved in federation mean. Therefore I contend that we are a more representative body than one which was elected when everything was. in a nebulous condition, and when a large number of persons did not quite understand what the whole business meant, could possibly have been. In the various States we are paying to the Judges on the bench more than it is proposed to pay to the Prime Minister, even if this motion is lost. </para>

Government some honorable members want to tie him down to a sum that will only about keep him. I think that is a mistaken view. The opportunity of following the- practice- of their profession is absolutely absent, except so far as one or two members of the Ministry who reside in the State in wwhich Parliament meets, and even that will be limited when we shift, as I hope we shall soon do, to the federal capital ; because wherever the capital is placed in New South Wales, from the professional and business point of view, it will be the home of not one of the Ministers who will compose the Administration, it means that they will have to give up all their private occupations. They cannot follow the practice of a profession for more than, perhaps, three months in the year at I the very outside, and I doubt if they can do that. Honorable members who have any knowledge of law know that if a man goes away for, say, six months from the place where he usually carries on his profession, it is not only what he loses during that time , which has to be considered, but the fact that he gets out of touch with the solicitors who would otherwise employ him. They get into other grooves, ana probably do not go near him during, the remaining six months, when he is there, unless it may be now. and again when there is a rush of work on. I do not pretend that the present Ministers are worth any more than their successors may be, but on the broad general ground that they have the most important work it is possible to conceive of, affecting the lives, the liberties, the prosperity, and the happiness of the millions in Australia, I think it would be a false policy on our part to indulge in any cheeseparing. I think the sum inclusive of the allowance of ?400 a year is little-enough indeed for those who undertake the onerous, responsible, and highly honorable work which the Federal Ministry have. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support the motion, because in my travels in South Australia during the recent electoral campaign, the great question raised in reference to this Parliament was the cost of its administration. It is all very well for the honorable member for Bland to endeavour to exaggerate the importance of the position of the Ministers on the Treasury benches, but I venture to think that, in comparison with the salaries paid in the States, the provision of ?.12,000 for Ministerial salaries was deemed by most of the States ample, and by some of the State Legislatures even too much. I would call the attention of the honorable member to the fact that amongst the suggestions made, I think from South Australia, as to that provision, was. one that it should be reduced to ?9,000 or ?1.0,000, and although the Prime Minister has stated that hi the calculation of the probable expenditure of the new Federal Government, which was prepared for the Convention's Finance Committee, of which I had the honour to be a member, the full number of members' salaries was included, I would like to point out that that was a rough and ready calculation, that the question of a few members, more or less, was not considered, and that the point as to whether the members of the Ministry should receive ?400 in addition to their salaries was never before that body at all. . The right honorable gentleman has alluded to the debates on this question in the Convention. The question was not allowed to pass without comment there. </para>

A similar question arose in the Convention as to whether a member of the Federal Parliament should be entitled to retain the position of member of a State Parliament, and that question was argued at some considerable length, but it was left, just as the question under discussion was left, to the good sense of the Federal Parliament, or the good sense of the States, as the case might be. I do not know whether the example of South Australia has been followed by any other State. </para>

            <para>- In the South Australian Parliament a motion was tabled by myself and was at first opposed by the then Government, but subsequently allowed to pass without a division, providing that no member of the State Parliament should at the same time retain a seat in the Federal Parliament, or take two salaries for filling the two positions. The question most prominent in . the smaller States - which, after all, are most closely interested in the financial question, as they can least afford to have their finances put in a difficult position by extreme charges or extravagance in any shape or form in Parliament- was the question what Members of Parliament were to receive as salaries and what Ministers were to receive. Not only that, but it was no uncommon thing - and I am sure you, air, must have experienced it in the course of your electoral campaign in South Australia, and other members also - to have questions fired at candidates as to the probable cost of the new Federal Parliament. </para>

            <para>- A very excellent definition. Perhaps I may say that my idea of economy is certainly not the extravagant exaggeration of the importance of our position as members of this Parliament, or as members of the first Federal Government. We private members have to neglect our business in adjoining States and sacrifice a great deal, for a stipend which does not in many instances make up for the loss and inconvenience we have to put up with. But the honour of the position as a member of the Federal Parliament of United Australia is something beyond the mere stipend of £400 a year, and the honour of being a member of the first Federal Government should count a great deal more than the loss of a few fat fees to the leader of the bar in an Australian State. </para>

            <para>- Undoubtedly, so far as I am concerned I do pay attention to that sort of argument, and I intend to follow my pledges given on the platform, and pay attention to them in the House. I think that the salaries voted for Ministers under the Bill should have been considered sufficient, and should even now be considered sufficient, just as our salaries, inadequate as some of us deem them, should be considered sufficient. The whole question is this : There have been rumours that members of this Parliament consider that they are underpaid and that it is the duty of Parliament to raise their salaries, or give special allowances. I indorse every word uttered by the honorable member for Coolgardie when he said the other day that we entered Parliament, as the Ministers took their seats on the Treasury benches, knowing exactly under the Constitution what salaries were provided for us. As that honorable member said, we should have considered before we asked the electors to send us here, whether the salaries were sufficient with the added honour of the position, to make up for any loss we might have in business or in our private professional practice. I take it that Ministers assumed office with a distinct knowledge that a sum of £12,000 or not exceeding £12,000, was the vote included in the four corners of the Constitution. </para>

That relieves myself and a good many others of much of the embarrassment we felt in regard to this motion. 1 certainly wish the Government had seen their way to go a little further, and initiate legislation to prevent any person drawing a second salary. I was a little surprised by the leader of the labour party, the honorable member for Bland, in the attitude he has taken up. My experience of the labour party in the past has been that they were strenuously opposed to anything beyond a reasonable remuneration - that they were strenuously opposed to anything in the way of high salaries. </para>

            <para>- I am very sorry to say a good many well-to-do men prefer -to look after their own selfish interests outside politics ; but I am pleased that we have some like the honorable member for Melbourne. Will that honorable member tell us his time is adequately remunerated .by £400 a year? I venture to say the honorable member would very often make that amount in one day, or even in one hour. I do not think we shall improve the character of Parliament by inducing men to. come here just for the sake of the remuneration attaching to the position. It would be a very unfortunate thing if we at- ' tempted to do anything of the kind. I was pointing out, when I was interrupted, that' I did not consider the £2,800 involved as in itself a very' serious consideration, but there is a very large and important principle involved in this expenditure. It is a true saving that he who rules over free men should himself be free. How can we consistently advocate economy if we begin with anything .approaching extravagance at the very root of Government ? If we claim full and adequate compensation for ourselves, whether we are members of the House or members of the Government, for the time we give to the service of the country, how can Ve be expected to exercise economy in any other direction ? I was very pleased to find that the proposals .of the Government have been so far in keeping with their professions of economy. The appointments we have made up to the present have certainly not leaned to the side of extravagance in any single instance I know of. There is my worthy, old friend the Cleric sitting in the chair at the end of the table, who gave up £1,200 a year to accepts position in the Commonwealth at £900 a year. And other positions have been similarly taken. Surely it is unfortunate that the only one departure :from the wholesome principle of economy so far, should be in the- direction in which we ourselves are personally interested. Of course we know that this is the introduction of the thin end of the wedge. We know that not only the salaries of Ministers are involved in the decision. We know perfectly well that if we commence our political career by increasing the remuneration attaching to the office of Minister, that will be followed by increasing the remuneration of members all round. If we decide to make the union unpopular, and to create an agitation for the undoing of that union, we cannot do better than begin by extravagance at the very seat of government. If we do that, we know perfectly well that we must follow it out in every other direction. I hope that the good sense of the House will rise superior to any such selfish considerations. I hope that honorable members will have regard to the importance of making the union popular throughout the Commonwealth, and I feel assured, whatever the verdict of this House may be, that if this question were referred to a referendum of the Commonwealth, the proposal that Ministers should draw two salaries would be negatived by at least ten to one. </para>

            <para>- They understand it perfectly well. It has never been recognised in any of the States throughout the Commonwealth as a desirable principle that men should be fully remunerated for the time which they devote to then-parliamentary duties. It would be most unfortunate if it were so recognised. If honorable members get a reasonable reimbursement of expenses or sufficient to enable every class of the community to be represented in the Legislature of the country, that is as far as we should go in the direction of expenditure in connexion with our parliamentary system. If we observe due economy at home, then we can consistently preach economy abroad j but if we begin by extravagance within the walls of Parliament, we cannot consistently or reasonably advocate economy outside </para>

            <para>- I am sure of it, and they have indicated that the right way is to give them the extra £400 without any reduction. I believe they are unanimous in that opinion. The honorable member for Gippsland professed surprise that the leader of the labour party had given expression to the sentiments which he has uttered. I am not surprised, but I am exceedingly glad that the honorable member for Bland recognises that he would not be assisting his party, or the workers in whose interests he so frequently toils, by refusing adequate payment to those in high and responsible positions. There is an idea abroad that if we cut down the salaries of Ministers and Governors, we shall increase the income of the working classes. If I thought that this £400 could be transferred to the pockets of the men who really want it, I might adopt the position taken up by my honorable friend the member for Gippsland. But it will not benefit a single member of the community. </para>

The honorable member for Gippsland appears to think that if a vote were taken on this question throughout the Commonwealth, ten to one would vote against the Ministerial suggestion. No doubt if my honorable friend were to stump the country and deliver speeches such as he has delivered in this' House the result would be so. But there is a very great deal in the way in which a matter is put before the people, and if some of us who entertain different views were following in the track of the honorable member and replying to his statement of the case, I doubt whether the proposal would meet with the fate that he has predicted. Speaking for myself, I have not met a man who is not in sympathy with the proposal to pay Ministers adequately, and to give them to understand that that is the only claim which they have a right to make for services rendered. </para>

I am just as anxious as the honorable member for Gippsland that this Parliament should begin on an economical basis. The whole question is - "What is economy?" There is true economy and false economy, and would it not be false economy to pay Ministers inadequately and by-and-by have to grant them annuities or to support their children. I urge just as strongly as the honorable member that in the interests of economy this House should begin by paying adequately for services rendered by those in its employ/ whether those services be rendered by Ministers or by the humblest servants of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- I intend to support the motion. I referred to this matter when speaking on the Address in Reply. It is not the amount involved about which I am concerned. It is rather a matter of principle. The practice in all the States has been that when a Minister accepts office, he ceases to draw his allowance as a member. I have no hesitation in affirming that, as. . far as South Australia is concerned, the people of that State were almost unanimously of opinion that the £12,000 provided for in the Constitution Act covered the whole of the Ministerial charges. I am positive that if a referendum were taken there to-morrow, they would decide against Ministers drawing the £400 allowance which is made to other honorable members. I believe that honorable members should come to this House and carry out the pledges which we made to our constituents. If there is one question that was raised more prominently than another in the State of South Australia during the federal campaign it was this question of economy. If Ministers are permitted to draw the ordinary member's allowance of £400 a year, I agree with the honorable member for Gippsland that it will be but the thin end of the wedge towards getting more salary. If that amount is 'allowed to Ministers, then no fault can be found with giving an increase of salary to honorable members. </para>

          <para>- I think it is to be regretted that the House has been called upon to discuss this matter in this manner. At the same time I think Ministers are to be commended, first for not drawing the members' allowance of £400 a. year in addition to their salaries, and next for the chivalrous attitude which they adopt in not voting on this motion. The question, as it appears to me, is one which has been suggested to many other honorable members in the same way. As far as my experience goes, we were all committed to a distinct promise to support economy in the administration of the Federal Government at the outset. There can be no sort of question that the people throughout, at any rate the State of Tasmania, for which I can speak personally, look to us to see that economy is exercised in every possible way, and to go behind the Constitution, as we should do in some degree by allowing Ministers to draw the member's allowance, would be to open the flood-gates to extravagance, and to give our sanction to that which we should all reasonably deplore. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has said how delighted the people would be to pay Ministers adequately, to pay everybody adequately, and he added that if the allowance of £400 per annum were taken "from Ministers and were to go into the pockets of the people, he would gladly advocate that course, but he overlooks the fact that money has to go out of the pockets of the people to go into the pockets of Ministers. I think that those who were at the Convention know that so far as any public action was taken there, so far as debate went on any subject touching this question, members of that body were decidedly in favour of the view that the salary of Ministers was to be a sum not exceeding £12,000, and certainly was_ not to include any addition by .way of allowance. We have had laid upon the table an estimate of yours, sir, showing the probable expenditure of the Commonwealth Government at £300,000 per annum. In that estimate it is quite true that the Ministers' salaries are put down at £12,000, and that the allowance for the full number of members is put down. But that was one of many estimates laid before the Convention. It was never considered, and never discussed, and has no sort of authority as the result of any debate or motion upon it. I hope that honorable ' members will not be misled by that paper, as being something which has the authorization of the Convention. And really when one has said that, one- has said nearly everything there is to say on the matter. We have undoubtedly at the outset to exercise the most rigid economy. We have to pay salaries which, although they may be small as compared with salaries paid to bank managers and specialists in other lines of life, are not small as compared with similar salaries paid throughout the States, and also in every other civilized community. The salaries which we offer in the Constitution to Ministers are ample by comparison with any standard that we can set up, as the honorable and learned member for South Australia has shown, and I hope that we shall support Ministers in a somewhat tardy spirit of renunciation, and see that they get merely their salaries and no allowance. The remuneration of members does not enter into the question at all. There is no sort of reason why, at the present moment, we should discuss that question. The Minister for Home Affairs has said that many honorable members are already dissatisfied, and will resign their positions if their allowance be not increased. I cannot understand any honorable member taking up that position. We all knew when we stood for election what we were going to receive, and we all ought, I think, to be satisfied with the allowance. The very utmost that could be allowed to be dune is to place those from the more distant States on the same footing as those from the States closer at hand. Some allowance might be paid for their passages by steamer and coach and so forth, which would bring about an equality. I can say that, although I am a member for a distant State, because I should never make any charge on the public exchequer for my expenses, inasmuch as I should do no travelling to and from Tasmania during the session. I hope that the motion will be carried, and that we shall* show to the people that we have the courage to be economical, to be saving of their rights and taxes, and to exercise the high privilege we enjoy in attending here to carry out that which is for their best material welfare. </para>

            <para>- I think there are two rules by which we may gauge what is adequate. One would be what men of similar calibre and ability practising their professions, or carrying on business would earn outside Parliament. If that be the rule" we are to adopt, then I am much afraid we shall never ;get inside this Parliament men of sufficient calibre and capacity, because we are not likely to attach to the office of Ministers such salaries as will bear comparison with what men of their class are realizing outside Parliament. Therefore we have to depend on some other motive than the mere money remuneration attached to the office to lead men to seek to be Members of Parliament and to be Ministers. That motive is the public spirit which calls men to aspire to these offices. It is no use our attempting to attract the men who are necessary to carry on the business of the country by attaching to the offices of Ministers money consideration which will be an adequate return for the services they render. If we were free to discuss the question - if nothing had been said about this matter previously - it might be that we should perhaps think that the payment of £400 a year, more or less, not worth talking about. But before I deal with the point as to whether we are free to discuss the question, I would like to say there is another measure of what is adequate remuneration. Some honorable members say that adequate remuneration is that which would be sufficient for a Minister to live. on. What is sufficient altogether depends on the standard of living we lay down for Ministers, and I, for one, desire to say - and I think I am voicing the opinions of a great many - I do not expect any one in an official position because of that position to spend money on functions, or go to any expense of the kind. </para>

          <para>- I think honorable members will agree with me, that, no matter how interesting, this has been a very unpleasant subject to debate. I must confess that I have seldom in my political career felt such painful misgivings in coming to a conclusion upon any question. This is a very important question, and I think that a great deal of the debate has been taken up with very irrelevant matter. It does not seem to me that this is a question of economy at all. It is a question whether every Member of Parliament, irrespective of his position as a Minister, should, as a member, take the salary which is given to him under the statute. The question as to whether the Ministers of the Crown are paid or underpaid is one for this House to consider upon another occasion. As far as usage is concerned, there is very little difficulty in coming to a conclusion. We find that in every Parliament throughout Australia the custom has been for a Minister not to take his salary as a Member of Parliament. We have certainly allowed the other principle to obtain dealing with the Speaker of this House and the President of the Senate, but whilst I am inclined to give a very considerable amount of weight to that, we must allow that it was done under exceptional circumstances to get out of a difficulty. We found that certain salaries were reasonable for those positions, and, as these gentlemen' had a statutory right, we had no power, under the circumstances, of dictating to them. Therefore we resorted to what one may call the device of reducing the salaries provided on the Estimates so as to bring them, with the allowance made to Members of Parliament, within the scope of our ideas. It has been said by some honorable members that the allowance to members of Parliament ought to be increased, and it is just possible that that may become a matter for debate in the future. That has made the difficulty with me in. coming to a decision on this question, because, though honorable members may think that the present high salaries of Ministers, plus the allowances of Members of Parliament is not too much, in. years to come the allowance to Members of Parliament may be considerably increased, and a mixing up of these two matters might cause a great deal of confusion. I do not for one moment say that Ministers of the Federal Parliament are over paid. I think there is no analogy between their position and the position of Ministers in other countries to which reference has been made. I think their expenses will be very great, and I am very much afraid we shall have to place, year after year, on our Estimates, a large amount of money for special allowances, owing to the peculiar nature of the duties which they have to perform. It will be a very objectionable item, and will often give rise to a great deal of unpleasant criticism. At the same tune the Government themselves have, notwithstanding the statutory right under which they can draw their allowances, asked us to consider the whole question in the light of the Constitution. Therefore, whatever may have been the events happening in the Convention, whatever may have been the opinions expressed there, these matters are now open to us for our decision. I do not hesitate for one moment to say that it was the understanding in the Convention that the usage in vogue throughout the Australian States would be the usage of the Commonwealth of Australia. I believe that that is perfectly clear. I feel a great difficulty in that I think it is the opinion of the people of the Australian States, that in reading this Constitution they had to read it that the amount of the salaries provided for Ministers was the whole amount which they would draw. </para>

Of course members will vote according to their convictions. i am voting with considerable hesitation, but i am voting for what i believe after all is the safe principle under all these circumstances, and the principle which was understood to underlie the provisions of this Bill. Therefore, while i shall be willing if any opportunity is given to consider further the salaries of Ministers, because the Constitution has put no limitation on the power of Parliament in that respect, i am obliged - i confess very reluctantly, and after the most careful consideration- - to come to the conclusion that as a matter of constitutional usage which is in vogue in these Australian States, and as the safer course under all the circumstances, the Parliamentary allowance should not be added to the Ministerial salary. </para>

            <para>- Probably the honorable and learned member disregards the possible effect of this Ministry insisting upon accepting the two remunerations. But the honorable member for West Sydney is an opponent of the Ministry. He glories in the fact that he is an opponent of the Ministry, and probably he is not at all anxious that they should keep in a safe course. I, as a supporter of the Ministry, am anxious that they should keep in a straight course. I am anxious that they should not take a false step - a step which might affect their position in this House or in the country, and those of us on this side of the House at any rate, who wish this question to be discussed calmly and dispassionately, are anxious, too, that the Ministry should receive the fair advice of their supporters, and that they will not consider that anything like coercion or dictation is being attempted. In my opinion, the Ministers of State can take the two remunerations with perfect legality, and with perfect constitutionality ; it is only a question as to whether they ought to exercise that power. On a previous occasion I took the opportunity of suggesting, without attempting to dictate, the advisability of not accepting the full measure of their legal rights. There may be times when principle is at stake, when men ought to accept the full measure of their legal rights ; but in this case it is a very serious question as to whether, both for their own sakes, and for the sake of their supporters, they ought to do so. I feel some difficulty, like other members do, in deciding how this question ought to bo put to the House. I would like some proposition to be put that might act rather as a suggestion to the Ministry than a pronouncement in this bold form, which they might take into consideration, and not regard as a dictatorial intimation. </para>

            <para>- I do not like to give a vote to deprive men of legal rights if they insist upon them. But I certainly would like to- give a vote that might act as a guide to these responsible gentlemen in arriving at a decision hereafter. I am quite sure that the attitude they assume is not based on a selfish desire to appropriate the two salaries. It may be that they wish to assert a principle, because they know the rights at issue are not merely their own rights, but those of Ministers to come after them. It has occured to me to suggest whether this question might not be put in a modified form such as this - </para>

But it seems to me that an expression of opinion that section 48 should be altered so as to regulate this matter in a legal and constitutional manner would not be so aggressive, and might not be so offensive to the gentlemen whose interests are at present at stake.

As the section begins with the words " until the Parliament otherwise provides," Parliament has an unfettered hand in regard to its amendment, and it can easily be amended by inserting words to the effect that all members except Ministers of State shall receive an allowance of £400 per annum. </para>

            <para>- I - I am sure the member for West Sydney never in any way intended to cast any reflection when he spoke of cheap advertising. What he said was that he himself could obtain a cheap advertisement. And so could I. What is a statesman ? A man who understands the past, who solves the present, who moulds the future is the statesman, and not a little tinpot local rooster plucker. What we have to do is to carefully consider this matter. I hope the honorable and learned member for Indi, the late Attorney-General for Victoria, will give us an opinion on this subject, because he is admitted to be one of the soundest lawyers in the Commonwealth of Australia, and I hope the matter will be looked into very seriously. If in America in the early days of nullification they had crushed it out, they would never have had to fight their great war, and many of their most able and best citizens would not be sleeping in Southern battle fields now, without stick or stone to mark their last resting place. That war arose because the question was not settled aright, and no question is settled until it is settled aright. They allowed the nullification doctrine to get headway. That was the beginning. What was the end ? In the end it had to be submitted to the arbitrament of war, in which slavery went down. I hope that will not happen here. I am behind the Government in this question. </para>

The House can always reduce an estimate, and supposing there should be, as I expect there will be, an Appropriation Bill brought forward with that £12,000 included, it will be quite open, without any Governor's message, for the honorable and learned member for South </para>

            <para>- Members of the Government as a Ministry are agreed on this matter, which has probably been made a Cabinet question. Members of the Cabinet may hold individual opinions, but the opinion expressed will be that of the Ministry. Although this question affects all Ministers personally, I think that they should take a somewhat wider view, and not be too thin-skinned about it. It is not a question of the salaries paid to A, B; C, and D. We are voting the salaries now of Ministers for all time to come. I say, therefore, with all humility, that Ministers would take up a better attitude if they put aside this sensitiveness, and voted according to their principles, because it is not themselves they have to consider, but Ministers of the Commonwealth for all time. </para>

            <para>- The capital around which most honorable member's interests centre is the State capital. That can be seen by the way in which honorable members look to their own State capital newspapers for light and leading. A Minister in a State can pursue his profession in the State capita], but a Minister of the Commonwealth has to give up the whole of his time to Commonwealth affairs, and I think it is quite right that he should do so. When I think even now of the high pressure under which Ministers are working in order to meet the demands of this House for legislation, the idea that it can be suggested that any Commonwealth Minister can carry on any other professional duties seems' an absurd one. </para>

            <para>- Various parallels have been drawn by some honorable members in regard to the position occupied by Ministers in other countries. But so far no one has stated that a Minister of the Crown in England, if he retires from office in -an impecunious position, is entitled to receive an allowance from the State. No such proposal has ever been made here. I am sorry that the forms of this House will not permit, after the motion has been put, of an amendment being moved upon it. if this motion is to be carried, I should certainly like, an amendment to be added, by which, if this £400 a year is to be taken away from Ministers, that amount shall be put into a pension" fund, which fund shall be available in future years for impecunious Ministers of State. </para>

            <para>- At the present time there are not. Perhaps we ought to be very glad of it. But that is really an argument in favour of my suggestion, simply because it allows of time in which the pension fund might grow. If £2,800 a year, with the interest which would accumulate upon it at? the rate of £84 per annum, were placed to the credit of a pension fund, it would, in a comparatively few years, be sufficient to keep Ministers of the - Commonwealth who had fallen upon evil days- in a position of affluence. It would only be following out the example adopted for many years in the United Kingdom. </para>

          <para>-.! am' one of those who very strongly objects to what appears to me to be a very distinct violation of our Constitution. We have a law under which we voted to our senators and members of the House of Representatives a sum of £400 a year. If the honorable and learned member who has moved this motion had waited till such time as it was proposed to distribute the whole sum allowed for salaries, that would have been the time that the matter could have received the fair consideration of this House. But to pick out a section in the Constitution, under which it is directed that each member of the Senate and of the House of Representatives shall receive a fixed salary of £400 a year, and to place this motion on the business-paper in regard to it is a thing that a majority of this House ought not to tolerate. I, have not felt that great delicacy and .indecision that has been referred to by so many honorable members, who have spoken in favour of the resolution. I have felt, and I have always stated, that, for the sake of the purity of Parliament, we should have purity in our Ministerial officers. Not only do I think that we should have good salaries paid to our responsible officers, but in our public life we should hold these high positions so much above the ordinary public offices that men of transcendent ability would lay themselves out to gain them, and be willing to cast aside their opportunities for gaining a living otherwise. I feel that a Minister of the Crown should be in the position to give up his entire time to his public duties. I think it is degrading to have this cavilling about the payment of Ministers when we know the great demands made upon the pockets of public men. </para>

        <para>Mr.E. SOLOMON (Fremantle). - I would like to give my reasons for voting in support of the motion. In Western Australia when a Bill for the payment of members was brought forward there was a special provision in it that the members' payment should merge in the payment to Ministers, and that was carried unanimously by the House. It seems to me that if this matter is not settled now the probability is that we shall have a debate each session similar to that we have had this evening. If it is really necessary that the payment to Ministers should be increased, I would be in favour of increasing the amount rather than they should accept the allowance given to ordinary members. In all likelihood there may be some motion before the House to increase the payment of members, and although the probability is that it will not be carried - and I for one would not vote for it - if such an increase were to occur, the Ministers would get a still further allowance. I think that there should be some finality arrived at at once in this matter, so that future Parliaments may not have it to decide. </para>

          <para>- I am sorry to have to detain the House on a subject which has been sufficient]}7 debated ; but I am unwilling to occupy an exceptional position in the Chamber because I shall soon be about the only member who has not spoken on the subject. In whatever form the motion is put to the Chamber, it is my intention to . oppose it in order that Ministers may have the right secured to them to draw their £400 a year in addition to the salary which they receive under the Constitution Act. My belief is that the circumstances of the Ministers of the Commonwealth are exceptional, and that they have duties to perform which are not analogous to those of the Ministers of the various States. They have to travel from capital to capital, and have to undertake obligations which, so far as I know, are not connected with any other similar office. My own feeling is that whilst I am here I should do everything that is within my power to secure economy in the expenditure of the Commonwealth funds ; but I do not consider that it is effective economy to reduce the salaries of those who are in the supreme control of our Commonwealth affairs. I believe, as was well said by one speaker, that it is inconsistent that a Minister who has control of a great and important department should be paid an amount inferior to what would have to be paid if we had to go outside Parliament and ask some person, because of his special knowledge, to take charge of that department. I may be permitted, perhaps, to refer to the fact that I am associated wit', large enterprises in the various States. In the control and conduct of those enterprises we have to pay very large salaries indeed, and I find that effectual results and also economies are secured by paying liberally the men whom it is desirable to have placed in such positions. I want to make the positions which Ministers occupy such that every honorable member may aspire to them, and feel that while he -must of necessity sacrifice in the interests of his country a very great deal, . his sacrifice will not be such as to make him feel that he is entirely surrendering all natural opportunities which come to him. It is a question of principle on which I am voting. I should have preferred to see the Ministers voting on the motion. I quite recognise the somewhat delicate position -in which' they might feel themselves _ placed, as they are to some extent interested in the result of the division, hut I apprehend that they would take a higher course if they voted. </para>

        <para>Mr. KNOX. - I hope they will be interested for a very long time. They ought to take the. broader view that we are dealing with a question of principle, and to give their vote not as though it affected only the positions they occupy. They have to look forward to others occupying those seats, and they are to-day guarding the privileges, the rights, and the emoluments of the offices which they so worthily hold. I would rather that the Ministers came forward and recorded their votes straight out on the principle. Speaking for honorable members round me here, if I may venture to do so, I think we should all have liked to see the Ministers taking that step. Nevertheless, I am deeply sensible that they may feel some delicacy in the matter, which we well appreciate. Whilst we are charged to see economies exercised as far as they may be possible, 1 do not think that this would be a departure in the direction of economy, and I think I am justified, in. the interests of the people I have the honour to represent, in giving my vote against the motion, so that ; whatever its spirit may be, the Ministers may carry out the letter of the Constitution, by which .they are permitted to receive an allowance of £400 a year in addition to the sum of £12,000 which they are entitled to draw and distribute among themselves as Ministers. </para>

          <para>- I take this opportunity to congratulate the honorable gentlemen who occupy the front Ministerial benches on what I consider will be a long tenure of office. I cannot disabuse my mind of the idea that had there been any possibility of what the Prime Minister terms a perambulatory pilgrimage from this side to that, we should not have had this motion emanating from a member of the Opposition. It has been said by the honorable member for North Sydney that there is a certain amount of indelicacy in the Ministers not having refrained from letting this question go to a vote. In my opinion, the indelicacy comes from the other side. I think it would have been more becoming and in better taste if they had allowed the proposal to come from this side. </para>

            <para>- I speak subject to the correction of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, but I think the effect of accepting his amendment will be that the salaries shall be drawn by the present Ministers until the requisite Act is passed. That would exactly accomplish what I should think should be done under the circumstances. The Prime Minister, in stating that the Ministry will not vote, has put himself in rather a peculiar position. If every time the House deals with these personal matters members are not to vote, how many will remain in the House when the question of the reduction of members' allowances arises? We would find ourselves in the paradoxical position of a Parliament trying to transact business in the absence of its members. The same principle applies in each case. It has been properly put by several honorable members that the Ministers are referred to in regard to the question of principle, and not in their private capacity. We are dealing with official salaries and not with matters of contract between themselves as private individuals and the State, and therefore I think they should vote on this occasion, and let their constituents know what their opinions are. The Prime Minister has referred to English official salaries. I find that the total payments to Ministers and members of- the States Parliaments in Australia and to the Ministers and members of the Commonwealth Parliament, including the £400 a year allowance, total £213,000 per annum in round numbers. In proportion to the English expenditure, that amount for 4,000,000 of people seems somewhat excessive, seeing that the parliamentary stipends drawn in England by Ministers do not total £100,000 a year, if there be deducted the-£30,000 drawn, not as salary, but as fees for special work done, by the law officers of the Crown. </para>

            <para>-- I am taking the total sum drawn out of the State coffers in .connexion with the work of government. That reminds me of a statement of the honorable member for Bland. Enunciating a platitude always acceptable to people if they do not examine it too closely, he says that, if we want to get good men we must pay them. But we must remember what men America has had. There the Supreme Court Judges started with comparatively meagre salaries, and I think they have set an example of purity and competence even to Australia. </para>

If the honorable member moves the introduction in that clause of the words he wishes to introduce - and I will gladly prepare the amendment for him - he can thus secure the interests of the railway servants in the way he desires. </para>

I propose to add after the words "Governor-General" the words "or commissioner," and I intend to raise now on a substantive amendment the whole question to which I referred in general terms yesterday when I spoke on the second reading, as to how far the actual exercise of executive power by the Governor-General is to go. Whether my view be right or wrong, this is a question of the highest importance, and one that this committee should very carefully consider before deciding. 1 heard the Attorney-General's eloquent speech on this matter, but it has not cleared my mind. </para>

            <para>- No, I think not, because clause 5 will stand whether the Governor-General or the commissioner make the appointment. This raises the whole question as to whether the commissioner is to appoint officers. I hold that the commissioner, and not the Governor-General, should appoint officers. I think the Attorney-General will agree with me that this is a very fitting and proper place in which to raise the issue. My amendment raises it fully, because by putting in the words "or the commissioner " we distinctly imply that the commissioner will be the appointing officer. </para>

            <para>- In line 4, after the words "Governor-General," I propose to insert the words "or the commissioner." . Obviously the Commissioner will have to be appointed by the Governor-General, and it may be that the inspectors also will be appointed by the Governor-General, but the great bulk of the service, if not the permanent heads too, should be appointed, in my view,, by the commissioner. I certainly shall have to speak for a little while on this matter, and I hope my remarks will create sufficient interest to raise a full discussion on the matter. Summarizing my views, the Bill makes the Governor-General, with certain exceptions, the executive power over the public service of the Commonwealth, and the commissioner purely an advisory officer. I desire to make the commissioner the executive power so far as the officers are concerned, although not so far as offices, salaries, or regulations are concerned. The sole question at issue between any two parties, or any number of parties, in the Chamber now in connexion with the Public Service Bill can only be as to how far we are to go before we, so to speak, cut off the supply of the Governor-General. I propose to cut off the supply of the Governor-General at a very much earlier stage in the evolution of the public service and its work than the Government propose to do. Some amendments later on in the Bill will show clearly which of these two persons is to exercise the power of appointment, because I hope that if my amendment is carried the Government will make consequential amendments to determine in which of these two authorities the power of appointment will be vested. For example, in clause 16, where the Governor-General appoints after officers have served their probationary period, I would substitute the commissioner, and I would do the same in similar clauses. But I would say again to the Attorney-General that this is a big question, which I do not think we should begin to discuss at this hour. </para>

            <para>- In my opinion the best place to raise a question of importance relating to the whole construction of a Bill is the first place, and this is the first place. We can get a clearer issue on this clause than we can in almost any other clause, because if I propose to substitute the commissioner for the Governor-General in any other clause, besides that general question there will also be the particular question raised as to whether, in the particular circumstances of that clause, he ought to be substituted. That issue will have to be discussed on the other clauses as they arise, but litre we can discuss the whole question. I ask the Attorney-General again whether we are to start the discussion to-night. </para>

          <para>- I should like to ask the Attorney-General if, in view of the very exhaustive debate on the question, he has taken into consideration the general desire of the Chamber to strengthen the hands of the commissioner'!! I understood that he was to prepare some amendments. If those amendments can be prepared by the Government in proper shape it is much better than private members taking a hand at it. I think the general feeling has been that in all matters of arranging salaries, changes in a department, and everything besides the actual discipline of the department - its current going, so to speak - the commissioner ought to have a much stronger position than he has under the Bill. This is a complicated measure, and it is not easy to interweave ideas into a Bill which has been constructed on rather a different principle. What I had intended was to ask the Attorney-General when we got to clause 5 - I had no idea that any issue would be raised at this point - whether he had any proposals to lay before the committee which would give us an intelligent grasp as to his views on the whole question. I think perhaps, if ray honorable and learned friend the member for Corinella would not mind, it might be better if we first had some remarks from the Attorney-General with regard to the result of the debate, and his views as to the reconstruction of the Bill to meet what I think are the wishes of the majority of honorable members. </para>

            <para>- The commissioner refused to hear the appeal he should have heard. In other words, the commissioner did not do his duty. That was not the fault of the system, but the fault of the commissioner in not obeying the instructions Parliament had given him. That is a very different thing from error arising from the wrong distribution of power. In what respect does the dissatisfaction exist in the public service of Victoria? It exists, in the first place, because the members of the public service of Victoria, especially the clerical division, consider that the allotment of salaries under the scheme of the Victorian Act of 1893 is not satisfactory, and they want a reversion to the original Act of 1890. That is a matter - the settlement of the scale of salaries - the Parliament itself, or the Governor-General as its deputy, should settle, and we are settling it in the Bill in regard to the clerical division. We are leaving the Governor-General to settle it by regulations apparently, in regard to some other divisions, and that is perfectly proper. The public service of Victoria is dissatisfied in this emitter, not because power is vested in the wrong person - it is vested in the right person, namely, the Governor in Council or Parliament - but because the power has not been exercised in the way the public servants think it should be. Consequently members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly on the floor of the Victorian House, have raised the question which is a parliamentary and legislative question, and should be raised, if at all, on the floor of Parliament. But this has not arisen because there is a Public Service Board, or because the Governor in Council has not the power he should have, or because Parliament has abrogated its powers. Parliament retains under the Victorian Public Service Act practicality the powers which Parliament retains in the Commonwealth Public Service Bill. I need not go into details as to differences, but will say that in essence the powers are the same. Troubles have arisen not because power has been wrongly distributed or has been given up by Parliament, but because Parliament has not exercised the power in the way a largo number of public servants think it should have been exercised. What is their ground of complaint? It is that promotions have not been carried out in a satisfactory manner. In the first place promotions have not been made when they should have been, and it is the Governor in Council who has not made them. They have not been made from motives of economy, and the Victorian service is full of acting officers instead of officers in foll service. The complaint first of all is that promotions have not been properly carried out. That is a function the Governor in Council has in Victoria, and one that he has not exercised to the satisfaction of the public service. It has been said that the promotion goes too much by seniority and not by merit, and that is purely the result of the Act, and purely the result of the Public Service Board in Victoria having taken the line of least resistance in regard to its recommendations. Here honorable members will see the position is exactly the same as in the Commonwealth Public Service Bill. We have the Governor in Council as the executive power, and the Victorian Public Service Board or the advisory board is exactly the same as the commissioner. No argument in favour of the Bill - can be adduced" from the example of the Victorian public service, for the simple reason that it is working practically under the same conditions as it is proposed the Commonwealth service shall work under. I know the Attorney-General can point to a score of differences between the Bill and the Act, but I am speaking of their general principles, and I think that the Attorney-General will agree with me that I am practically right. There is one active commissioner with active inspectors instead of a somewhat supine board, but in other respects the conditions are practically the same. As to the distribution of power and the appointment of some one to advise, the positions are practically analogous. Consequently, when the honorable member for Melbourne Ports says that the Victorian public service is seething with discontent and something else - 1 forget the word--- </para>

            <para>- I said there was .no grave discontent. The honorable member Says he has found grave discontent. The honorable member happens to represent a constituency which contains fully half of the railway servants of Victoria. I know that there are complaints of the commissioner's appointment. I have even heard suggestions of nepotism, but I do not for one moment say that they are true. I venture to think that there are no greater complaints in the railway service than there are in the public service on these grounds. So far as my experience of the Victorian Legislature was concerned, I may say that I had more railway men in my electorate than other public servants, but I did not find that there were more complaints amongst the former than amongst the latter. I am not going to weary the committee by malting a long speech. I believe that strong objections can be urged to the course which I propose should be taken. Indeed, I do not know of any course that any one could take in connexion with settling the principles of this Bill to which strong objections could not be urged. I do not know of any method | of distributing the power, against which weighty arguments could not be offered. But after all we have to select the least objectionable of the various courses open to us. The Attorney-General last night did not outline a system of political control without political patronage. The Bill simply says that the Governor-General shall do everything, although he has to take all sorts of people's advice. Let us take the three clauses to which the Attorney-General directed attention, namely, clauses 21, 36, and 38_ When the Attorney-General was about to deal with clause 36, I interjected that before he left clause 21, he might tell us whether the promotions as recommended under that clause to the Governor-General took place as a matter of course. He did not answer either "yes" or "no," but I gathered from what he said afterwards that practically any ordinary promotion recommended by the Governor-General would be carried into effect as a matter of course. </para>

            <para>- That is so. If we come to clause 36, we find that that relates to the ordinary appointments to vacancies, the basis of promotion or transfer being efficiency. I heartily approve of efficiency being the basis instead of seniority. Seniority is to be the determining factor other things being equal, but not otherwise. That is the only stimulus that can be properly applied to the public service of the community. It is the only substitute for the ordinary business stimulus of hoping to get on in the world. I ask honorable members whether it is more likely to be believed that favoritism is used in connexion with these promotions if the promotions are made by the Governor-General than if they are made by the commissioner ? </para>

            <para>- Should the Government not trust the commissioner they had better get rid of him at once. It would pay the Commonwealth to pay him his salary for the rest of his period rather than have the Executive taking the nominations of a man whom it did not trust. I see there is a power in this Bill to transfer the inspectors to some other place in the service. The. reason for that I presume is that the Government may not be able to trust them. But we have to start by assuming both a trustworthy Executive and a trustworthy commissioner. If A, B, C, D, E, and F are officers in order of seniority, and A retires, and F is promoted, B, C, D and E are still living in the Attorney-General's utopia if they do not think there is something wrong about what has been done. There is far less probability of influence being brought to bear, if these appointments or promotions are made by one commissioner for the whole continent than if they are made by an Executive which is under the control of seventy-five members of this House, and who come from and reside in various parts of the Commonwealth. The commissioner is far less likely to have the tentacles of influence stretching out to various parts of the Commonwealth than is the Executive through honorable members. But assuming that the commissioner was so bad as to put all his friends into positions in the public service, he would not be able to fill the service, because he would not have that many friends in the community. In these interjections, criticising what I am saying, it is just assumed that the commissioner is sitting free and unfettered to do what he chooses. But the commissioner is limited in the first place by this Act, in the second place by any schemes of classification which are embodied in the Actor regulations made by the Governor-General, and in the third place he is limited by all the regulations made by the Governor-General dealing with the fourteen or fifteen subjects with regard to which the Governor-General is entitled to make regulations. Let us assume, for example, that the commissioner appoints persons improperly to enter the service. He cannot do so if the Governor-General does his work, because the regulations have to state in what way people are to be allowed to enter the service. If the commissioner violated those regulations by appointing people who were not fit for the positions, he would be disobeying the orders given to him by his master, the Parliament. If it is said that the commissioner may promote a person not entitled to promotion, there would be regulations dealing with the promotions as to how promotions shall be made. And if it is said that the commissioner would not select the most meritorious, then I say that he is just as likely to appoint the most meritorious as is the Governor-General. </para>

            <para>- I would differentiate in the Bill. As a matter of fact they are so differentiated. I am aware that there are two or three exceptional cases in which it is possible for men to jump a class, but those are extraordinary cases. In promotions outside the ordinary cases, provided for in clause . 21, I would specify either in the Bill or in the regulations, that cases in which there would be a veto allowed over the commissioner's action or over his decision. I would not allow the Governor-General power to veto everything which the commissioner recommends. From the beginning to the end of this Bill the commissioner can do absolutely nothing. He can recommend a host of things, but he can do nothing. As the Attorney-General says, he is merely a watch dog. But it is often said that it is no use keeping a dog and barking oneself, which is exactly what this Bill does. The Governor-General is going to do all his own barking, when he might be much more profitably employed. I ask what cases would arise under such a system, which would be more likely to be unsatisfactory than under tine system proposed in this Bill ? If honorable members say - "But under your proposals such and such a thing may happen," it is perfectly true. I admit that these things may happen, but on the other hand we must look to see if these tilings cannot happen under the Governor-General's regime. </para>

Did he not tell us that if the commissioner nominated - other people having to recommend, or not having to recommend in various cases - and the Governor-General adopted the commissioner's recommendation on that, of course the commissioner would not be considered responsible for the action. In other words, the Executive, according to the" Attorney-General's own statement of the objects and scope of the Bill, says that the Governor-General would only accept responsibility when he differed from the commissioner. </para>

            <para>- In other words, the Governor-General would only be responsible on a charge of general maladministration .or general lack of administration, the ordinary want of confidence motion, no doubt. He would not be responsible for each specific case, and I ask whether it is wise to make him responsible for each specific case. Are we in every case of an appointment, reduction, or dismissal to have the whole existence of the administration, the whole question of the public service, brought up before this House, and are the Government to be liable to a vote of want of confidence on all sorts of occasions ? I think that would make the whole tiling unworkable. It may be admitted that there are objections to the course I urge, but it is open to fewer objections than the course proposed by the Government. </para>

            <para>- In other words, instead of his making suggestions and nominations and submitting them to a responsible Minister, the Minister would have to go down on his knees and apply to the commissioner, and all the pliability which we have a right to look for in a Bill of this kind, in view of the possible necessity for going outside the public service to get special men, would be lost, and the power of appointment would rest solely with this autocrat of a commissioner. </para>

            <para>- I go a long way with the honorable member when he wishes that the commissioner in every case of appointment or transfer from one grade to another and everything that affects the life of the public service, should have the right to be consulted and report, so that if he disagrees with anything that may be done a record may be made of it, and it can come before the House in his report. Furthermore, while I think we want to make our measures as complete as possible in starting this Commonwealth, we do not want to begin with an unnecessarily drastic enactment. Let us try to create a system by which we can suppose that the responsible Minister and the permanent heads and the commissioner are all individually trying to do their best for the public service of the country. If we fmd that, notwithstanding all our commonsense regulations, and the check upon check that we are introducing into this Bill, corruption and political influence are still having their sway, it will be time enough for us to resort to more drastic measures. I would again ask the honorable gentleman in charge of this Bill if he will candidly tell us that he accepts to a large extent, as a direction to him and the Government, the almost universal expression of opinion that the right of the commissioner to be heard on every question connected with the life of the public service should be recognised. </para>

It is a difficult problem,but I am quite sure that it is not got rid of by shunting responsibility on to an irresponsible person. I think the experience in Victoria, as it must be in New South Wales, and also, I gather, in Tasmania, is that we do not prevent abuses by putting the responsibility or a man who cannot be touched by Parliament. There are just as many abuses. I have seen a good deal of the railway men and of the public servants, and I know that there are quite as many complaints when we have an irresponsible head appointed for seven years or thereabouts, who is left to do everything at his own sweet will. </para>

            <para>- The more I turn this matter over in my mind the more I think that the Government have, if not hit on a final solution, hit on an experiment, which I think is well worth trying, in the system they have adopted. That experiment, I understand, is this - to give no initiative in these matters to the Governor-General in Council. That is a protection against political pressure - and then to give no finality to anybody except the people's representatives. The idea is that the initiative ought to come from the commissioner and his officers, and then of course he will lean on his officers, the inspectors, and others. After he has spoken, let the responsibility for every act fall on the Ministers. Let the Ministers feel that they cannot get rid of their responsibility to the country by saying that it 'is all done by some one over whom we have no control. </para>

            <para>-Quite so. Although the honorable member for Corinella has proposed an amendment in regard to the system of appointments, and although the discussion might be limited to that amendment, I might say, in order to save time hereafter, that when it comes to a question of promotions, transfers from department to department, and all those dangerous powers, the same principle might be carried out as is carried out in regard to appointments. That system is to leave the initiative with some person not the Governor-General in Council, and to leave the final sanction and responsibility of every act with the Governor-General in Council. I hope, therefore, that this particular amendment will not be carried, although I feel that it lias given us a very able and useful contribution to the debate. </para>

          <para>- No person could have listened to the debate without feeling that opinions, however well seasoned, are liable to a considerable amount of readjustment. No one, for instance, could have heard the thoughtful speech of the honorable member who has just resumed his seat without feeling that there is a great deal in the suggestions he has made. The honorable member for Corinella, who moved the amendment well and creditably, does not, I think, endeavour to create the state of things which the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has described. For instance, the honorable and learned member talks of the commissioner being made an absolute autocrat if he be given the right of appointment. That is not exactly a true representation, and it rather spoils the fairness of the honorable and learned member's speech. It would appear from the speech of the honorable member for Corinella that the public service of Victoria has pretty well the same rights as are provided for in this Bill, but the Parliament of Victoria has failed to give justice or satisfaction to the public service. Then, again, we learn that the Public Service Commissioners, with their very full powers, have failed also to give satisfaction to the public service. But honorable members know that we will never give satisfaction to all the public servants until we allow them to appoint themselves and decide their own salaries. We desire to be fair, and the question before us is whether the commissioner shall have the power to appoint. My opinion, though it is subject to re-adjustment, is that the commissioner ought to have the power of appointment. Although I think he ought not to Joe an absolute autocrat, he ought to be given power to appoint. Some means ought to be found of controlling him, and those means could be found possibly in a board of inquiry, the appointment of which would remain in the hands of the Executive in case of any suspicion of wrong-doing. I do not think that the Parliament or the people would stand an autocrat. Could the commissioner not be given the right to appoint, and the Executive have power to inquire as to the fitness of the appointments? </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Corinella has placed this question before the committee in a very proper and distinct manner, but I think it has been pretty well demonstrated that we are not going to surrender the right of executive responsibilities. Reverting to the speech of the Attorney-General last night, I must say that the only reason why I was not satisfied with it was that it did not proceed to' deal in the same fashion with the other aspects of the Bill. I. was perfectly satisfied with the way in which the honorable gentleman put his case as to the parts of the Bill which he treated of, but I was waiting and anxious to hear him deal in the same lucid and convincing manner with other portions of the Bill. But this particular branch of the subject - the right of the Executive to take part in appointments, and also in transfers and promotions, which are the necessary corollaries - I think he put beyond any doubt. I am able to speak from various stand-points, not only as a citizen and as an old member of the public service, but as one with some experience 'in administration. I desire to say very shortly than when the matter is properly considered, there is no doubt whatever that there must be for the efficient working of the public service three distinct safeguards - a permanent head, the commissioner or somebody in his position, and finally the Executive sanction. First of all the permanent head must express the wants of his particular department. Then the commissioner has to express his views for the benefit of the public service without regard to political considerations, and then there must be the connecting link between the service and the general public, namely the Executive, to finally come in and pronounce judgment. I did not understand the Attorney-General to say last night that the Executive, or the Governor - General as representing the Executive, was to be in all cases or even as a rule to engage in a mere perfunctory exercise of power. I did not understand the honorable gentleman to say, that usually, as a matter of course, the Governor-General would adopt the recommendation or nomination of the commissioner. The responsibility of the Executive is a real and very serious one, and no commissioner, however earnest he may be, is free from a tendency to slip into grooviness, and to lose touch with public requirements, and new notions. To say, as the honorable member for Corinella said, that if we are going to let the Governor-General deal with this matter of appointment it is virtually handing it over to Parliament, and that Parliament is unable to do it, is going too far. I think the analogy fails, We might as well say that no department should be administered by a Minister, seeing that Parliament has the oversight of that Minister, on the ground that Parliament cannot administer a department. . </para>

            <para>- We will not be able to avoid that if we have a commissioner appointed. We cannot exclude from Parliament cases which individual members like to bring forward as a last appeal for justice. When we take into consideration the whole matter, I think we must agree that to exclude the Executive would be a fatal mistake. We have examined the various systems. We have Canada on the one hand, where there is an absolute executive system. There, the Governor-General in Council appoints, transfers, promotes, and dismisses, practically without the intervention of a commissioner or any other official. </para>

          <para>- I had no notice of any amendments in the earlier part of this clause, but there are certain verbal amendments which I intend to propose. They will not alter the sense, but I think they will make the first sub-clause more precise. In that sub-clause, line 5, I propose to omit the word "such," to insert the word "the," and to make a number of other verbal amendments. Sub-clause (1), in the form which I suggest by way of improvement, will read as follows : - </para>

            <para>- Of course I cannot press it, though I would have liked to have made a few verbal amendments with a view to simplifying this clause. In order not to keep the House waiting, the Bill was published without final verbal revision. I will undertake to have printed and circulated all the amendments that alter the Bill more than verbally. I may mention that I have specially made a provision for officers of the general division being able to enter the clerical division on passing examination. I have taken the regulations of New South Wales, which will be very useful in that regard. I intend also making a proposition which, I hope, will be acceptable to those who suggested that automatic increases should be given till a living wage is reached. I have an alternative proposal which will enable men to obtain a living wage on proof of their qualifications. With reference to the appeal board, I have a proposal to permit a member to be chosen from the particular division of the service in which the person against whom the charge is made is employed, and a number of other amendments which are more or less important in regard to the working of the measure. </para>

The advantages of the insurance system are much greater than those attaching to the alternative system of superannuation, which was only designed as a safety-valve to prevent hardship. </para>

            <para>. - I understand that a Bill in which J. was interested has been dealt with in another place, but that a certain intimation that we are expecting will not reach us until to-morrow. I notice that there is very little business on the paper for to-morrow, and I understand practically only one motion that will provoke any debate, and that a very short one, so that I am not asking the House to depart from the usual meeting hour to-morrow. In answer to what the honorable member for Wentworth said, if I see any sign of congestion in the business paper for Fridays I shall adopt his suggestion, which was in the mind also of the Government, and alter the sessional order so as to meet in the morning on Friday, but that necessity has not arisen yet.

            <para>- I wish to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to one matter which may be of some importance. Amongst the Bills which are distributed there are, and probably in the' future to a still greater extent there will be found, provisions affecting the States in various ways, in connexion with the railways and other matters. I would ask the Government if they would take care to send in every such case an intimation to the various State Governments of the proposals in that regard. I have had my attention drawn to the fact that important proposals were made, and that it was some time after the authorities in another State had received on intimation of them that they reached the Victorian Railway department. I would ask the Government if they would kindly see that the States do get timely intimation of any proposals, and also that all the States get the intimation at the same time. </para>

That was an intimation to the State authorities in respect of the Bill. If there was any difference, if in another State any intimation of that kind was received before a similar intimation waa received in Victoria, that was entirely on inadvertence, and I shall take care that the practice is made as equable as possible. </para>

I propose when the motion is called on to-morrow . to ask that it be taken on the 16th August. That will leave the motion as to old-age pensions at the head of the list.
