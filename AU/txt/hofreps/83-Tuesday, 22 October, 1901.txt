                    (Tasmania). - I desire to express my sincere thanks to the Prime Minister for the great courtesy he displayed towards me on Friday last in allowing me to continue my speech to-day. I shall not attempt to take undue advantage of that kindness. I shall curtail my speech for two reasons - first, because only a comparatively small number of honorable members have spoken; and secondly, because I do not suppose that anything I may say is likely to have any influence one way or the other. When the House adjourned on Friday last I was referring to an attack by the honorable member for Tasmania,
                    Fysh, on a certain statement of the leader of the Opposition, which he turned into ridicule, or which he asserted was not correct. He said that the leader of the Opposition had met a grocer who took a rise out of him, and that an analysis of the Tariff showed that whilst a grocer might raise the price of seven articles, there were thirteen articles on which he would have to decrease it. And when I was proceeding to point out from a price-list that that statement was not in accordance with facts, the honorable member for Echuca interjected that it merely showed' the dishonesty of the merchant. Unfortunately for his interjection, the price-list I now hold in my hand is the price list of a Victorian manufacturer, and not of a Victorian merchant. The firm in question are Parsons Brothers Proprietary Limited, having mills and offices at 581 and 587Collins-street, Melbourne. Comparing the price-list for this month with that for last month, I find that' on an average the increase per lb. on the various articles they quote ranges from1d. up to 2Â½d., and occasionally more. I also find that there are no less than 94 separate articles on which an increase has been charged. That must substantiate the truth of the assertion of the leader of the Opposition, and prove conclusively to honorable members that it was the honorable member for Tasmania,
                    Fysh, who made the mistake. That honorable member then went on to make an appeal " on behalf of Tasmania for assistance, stating that she had sacrificed a good deal to come into the Federal Union, and that, as her pecuniary position was not good, she should receive assistance from the other States.

                    <para>- If the honorable gentleman has not done so he has been incorrectly reported. If he has done so, I, for one, repudiate any such idea. I look upon this, not in the light of a partnership for better or worse, but as a commercial undertaking into which the States, just like men, have entered. Men put a certain amount of money into a firm or company with the idea that they ore going to benefit by so doing. If they do, well and good ; if they do not, one partner does not go to the others and ask for assistance. If Tasmania has made a mistake in entering into this Union, she must put up with the consequences. I shall be no party to asking for assistance for her. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, who, I regret to observe, after having delivered his speech seems to have retired, made a very strong appeal on two subjects. One appeal was on behalf of the farmers of the Commonwealth. I, as a farmer, tried on Friday last to put their side of the case, and to point out that a protectionist policy was not going to benefit them. I now come to the appeal on behalf of the manufacturers of mining machinery. I should like the attention of the Minister for Defence to what I am going to say, as I believe there is no State in the group which will suffer more from this protective policy, if it is the will of the Parliament, than Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>- And Queensland too, very likely. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo said that at Ballarat they could make machinery equal to that made in any part of the world, and gave us what he called proof of his assertion. I propose to take one of the best mines in the Ballarat district, namely, the Glenfine South, which is no doubt well-known to honorable members. About a year ago the very best machinery manufactured in Victoria was erected on that mine. They have 40 head of stampers which crush some 2,500 tons of stone per month, giving an average of two tons per day per stamper, while at Kalgoorlie, in Western Australia, the mines equipped with the Frazer and Chalmers' batteries put through an average of four tons per stamper per day. It may bc said that the stone in Western Australia is more friable, and, therefore, more easily crushed than is the stone at Ballarat, and I am perfectly willing to concede that the Ballarat stone may be harder, and that there may be a slight difference in the capacity of the batteries on that account. </para>

                    <para>- -When I find, however, that the Frazer and Chalmers' batteries erected on the Rand at Johannesburg, where the stone approximates to that at Ballarat, also put through a higher average quantity per stamper, I can only come to the conclusion that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo is entirely wrong in his statement that the Victorian machinery is equal to that made by Frazer and Chalmers. There is another item in this Tariff that will press very severely on the people of Western Australia, and that is the duty on condensed milk. I do not, however, desire to deal with the items in the Tariff which more particularly affect the people of Western Australia, as I believe that the honorable members who have been returned for that State are quite competent to look after their interests. It was understood that free-trade was to take place' between" 'the various States as soon as this Tariff was tabled ; but I find to my extreme regret - and I am speaking in the interests of Victoria - that the intercourse between the States is sot so free as we were led to expect it would be. Although this matter has not very much to do with the Tariff, it may be of some importance to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and I desire to coll his attention to the fact that in Tasmania certain wharfage charges are levied at the various ports. I find that flour manufactured by local millers can be sent from Hobart and Launceston to the "West Coast ports, such as Strahan and various other centres, and be landed free of wharfage dues ; but that flour sent over from Melbourne to Devonport is subject to a wharfage duty of 5s. per ton. </para>

                        <para>- What I desire to point out is that honorable members in another place are elected on a more popular basis than are the representatives in this Chamber. Whilst honorable members in this House represent various districts in the States, the members of the Senate were elected by the people of the various States voting as a whole. Therefore it seems to me that the Tariff should be allowed to go up to another place, and, if it is not carried there, that the people of Australia as a whole should have an opportunity of expressing their opinions through a general election. I always welcome an appeal to the people, and I think we should consult the people regarding this Tariff, because when it is settled it should be allowed to remain undisturbed for many years to come. </para>

                    <para>- We have just had a very refreshing free-trade speech from an honorable member, who I understand was a few years ago a strong protectionist - who assisted to impose 20 per cent duties upon goods imported into Tasmania, together with a 20 per cent, drag-net provision. Some remarks have been made by the honorable member with regard to reaper and binder twine and, mining machinery, which I will deal with later on. There is no doubt that this debate is probably the most important that we shall have here for many years. It will be an historical debate, and I do not think, therefore, that too much exception should be taken to the very fullest expression of the views of honorable members in all parts of the House. We have come to the parting of the ways, and have to decide what is to be the fiscal policy of Australia for some years to come. We have to determine whether we shall adopt a policy of stagnation, under which all colonial industries will languish, or pursue a policy of development. </para>

                        <para>- We have to make up our minds whether this Common wealth, consisting of six States, is to be ruled by the policy which has obtained in five of those States, or by the policy which has ruled or rather misruled New South Wales. Of course, we cannot complain of honorable members from New South "Wales endeavouring to impress their views upon us; but it would be too much to expect the representatives of all the other States to accept their proposals. The honorable member who has just sat down made a most extraordinary remark. He said that if this motion were lost, it would be the duty of the free-trade party to take no further hand in the consideration of the Tariff, but to leave it to be dealt with somewhere else. That is an extraordinary position for any representative to take. A Tariff is always in the form of proposals, which are considered in committee in order that honorable members may shape them in the light of fuller knowledge which debate affords. To say that a great party, such as that to which the honorable member professes to belong, will willingly throw up the sponge and leave the work to be done by another House, is an extraordinary statement. </para>

                <para>The situation forced upon us can be forced upon any Government. Do not mistake me when I say that the situation forces itself upon us. I am a protectionist and so are nearly all my colleagues. </para>
                <para>But if we are to raise the great revenue for the security of the federation then we cannot be prohibitionists, and our protection must be moderate, because prohibition or exclusive protection would lead to a prevention of that access of revenue which is necessary for the proper Government of the country. Australia has known Tariffs for many years. In all the States there has 'been more or less protection. Even in New South Wales there is still Â£3 a ton on sugar. Who left it there ? What is it there for V Are we to abolish that protection now, and begin the prosperity of the union by ruining our northern farmers ? Free-traders have refused to do it. Are we to say that while we are to do that for ourselves we are not to apply the same argument to our neighbours who have grown up with us? </para>
                <para>We must take the situation as we find, it, and whether we are allied protectionists or revenue Tariffists are we not bound to fill our Treasury ? We must have revenue without destruction. Remember those words - Revenue without destruction ; a Tariff maintaining employment and not ruining it. By1 this constitution a complete intercolonial system of trade begins with the Commonwealth Tariff. No Australian who has the slightest regard for his country can consent to u state of things which- means the destruction of industries, and which means that the celebration of Australian nationality would be accompanied by the pattering of the bare feet of the people driven out of employment. That must not be, gentlemen. We cannot run the Commonwealth in that way. And this Ministry will not dream of instituting the first Tariff of the Commonwealth in such a way as first not to raise the revenue that is needed, and next to impose direct taxation, which will cripple the component States ; and, thirdly, to so construct the Tariff as to leave the people barefoot and homeless. We will leave that to others. In this tax there must be no rule of thumb. No Tariff that is now in force can claim to dictate to or exclude its fellows. No duty is to be adopted, because it is the lowest, and none because it is the highest. Each Tariff will be considered, and decided on its merits. By this means, we hope to present to you a business-man's Tariff, a practical working Tariff, and a really Federal Tariff ; and by that means we shall ovoid disaster, suffering, bitterness, and, with those things, the antagonism to union which has made them possible. Men of all opinions who hope for the good of their country first, and their own policy second, can agree that the first Tariff of Australia ought to be considerate, preservative of existing production - liberal in its attitude towards those engaged in production. </para>
                <para>There is nothing about a revenue Tariff there. </para>
                <para>Will anyone tell me that the farmer, losing part throughout Australia of any protection that he had, is to be made better and safer after intercolonial free-trade by losing the remnant of protection that will remain to him? Is the farmer so safe that he can afford to dissever himself from the responsibilities of all other industries ? I think not. He has only to turn his eye to Western America on the one hand, and to the enormously increasing employment of cheap labour in Argentina on the other, to picture to himself what it is to suffer under a revenue Tariff. Surely it is necessary to him that the protection left him under intercolonial free-trade should be maintained now. I wish to combat another policy which has not yet become a popular policy. I have not come here to conduct a protectionist campaign, though under other circumstances I should have been prepared to do so. </para>

                        <para>- If only a portion of us were to suffer, it would not be a fair Tariff. The Government have endeavoured to do their best, according to their lights, and they have had a most difficult task. It is all very well for glib-tongued orators to stand up on the platform, and talk about the rights of the working man and the poor farmer. Pretty friends they have been to the poor farmer and the working man in the past! It is not to them that the working man and the " poor farmer " will turn in times of distress. It is all very well for the free-traders to put up the '' poor farmer " as a stalking horse for the purpose of helping the foreign traders, but the people of this Commonwealth are much too wise to be led away by any such talk as that. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member referred to the next election he seemed to refer to myself, personally. I have been put up for election a good many times, and have always been returned. I have never had to change my seat. With regard to that matter, I may point out that the whole of the northern district of Victoria, from east to west, is represented in this House by honorable members who have had to face probably the leading free traders in this State, with all the money and all the influence of the free-trade party and the importers at their back. We have here the honorable and learned member for Indi, the honorable member for Moira, the honorable member for Wimmera, and myself, who had to face four of the principal free-traders in this State, backed up by all the wealth and strength of the free-trade party. Yet, in purely farming constituencies, we beat them easily. We are therefore quite as well prepared to wait for the next election as is the honorable member for Maranoa himself. If we are to progress in this great Commonwealth, we must do so by means of all kinds of industries. The idea of the free-trader seems to be that in a great continent like this we should devote ourselves to producing the raw material, and that the primary industries are the only industries that should be encouraged. They seem to think that we should export our raw material to other parts of the world to be manufactured and brought back in the shape of finished goods. No country was ever great that devoted itself entirely to such industries ; and certainly Australia with its wonderful advantages of soil, climate and minerals, and with its infinite capacity for production, can never be great if that idea is to prevail, as honorable members opposite would like it to do. They ask us to adopt f reetradeinthiscountry,knowing well that almost every nation on the earth with which we should do any trade at all is, with the exception of one, strongly protectionist. We have Germany, France, Canada and the United States taxing our wheat 6d., l0d. and1s. a bushel, imposing a duty of 2d. a lb. on our beef and mutton, and taxes on our other products with the exception, perhaps, of wool. Yet we are told that we should be free-traders and that those protectionist countries that ruthlessly shut their ports against our commodities should be allowed to send their goods here and destroy the industries of our own people. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members opposite desire to work not for the benefit of our own people, and for the young people who are coming after us, and who will make this a great nation. They wish us to work for other people ; for they desire that the higher branches of industry should be pursued by foreign nations, and that we ourselves should be simply " hewers of wood and drawers of water " for them. That is the free-traders' idea of a perfect country ! Now, I should like to make certain propositions. One is that no country has ever attained to commercial greatness, in modern times, by means of free-trade. Every country that has attained to commercial greatness has done so by means of protection; and no country but one, has been commercially progressive under free-trade, and that is Great Britain, whose circumstances are so different from ours that she is certainly not an example for us to follow. The experience of countries under similar circumstances to our own and. under similar conditions to our own, points irresistibly to the fact that if we desire to progress we can do so only by the adoption of protection. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of a country and not of a State. Those who have studied fiscal history must know that for the last three or four hundred years no country in Europe has progressed commercially and industrially under a policy of free-trade, and that every country on the continent of Europe has had to adopt that policy before it could make any progress at all. Up to some 400 years ago the great seat of manufacturing industries was in Western Europe ; and we know that in the early periods of English history, under such laws as our free-traders would have us pass now, all the raw material produced in England was sent to the Continent, and came back in the shape of finished goods, whilst English people were not allowed to make up finished implements and articles of clothing for themselves. </para>

                <para>At the close of the revolutionary war Great Britain was in the midst of that protective period which had been so vigorously pursued since the time of Elizabeth. During the so-called period of confederation, from 1783 to 1789, we find for the first and perhaps the last time in the recent history of the world, a nation under absolute free-trade. It took but little time to demonstrate what such a system will bring upon a country. In three years' time nearly all the country's money had passed into the pockets of British merchants and manufacturers, and we were almost without the means to make or raise anything for ourselves. With no tariff whatever, our shores were heaped with the products of every nation, of such kind and description that we could not make even a feeble attempt to establish any competing industries of our own. </para>

                        <para>- I endeavoured to ascertain what the value of these imports was, in order to discover what the farmer would have to pay if, as some have suggested, we adopted a drag-net which would put a duty on all these articles. I find that in connexion with a number of smaller articles no record is kept as to the value. But in connexion with bags - bran, corn and flour, gunny, woolpacks, cream separators, manures, reapers and binders, rock salt, shafts and bars, poles, seeds, and wire netting, an estimate of the value can be formed, and the value of the imports of these items alone amount to Â£456,586. That is the value of these articles imported annually, and a duty of 10 per cent, upon that value would mean that we should take out of the farmers' pockets Â£45,658 upon articles which, under this Tariff, will come in free, and which we cannot well produce in this. country at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of articles that it is proposed to admit free. Wire netting comes in free now. It is said that the farmer is taxed 15 per cent, on his. machinery and implements, but the whole of the light implements used in connexion with farming are absolutely free. Disc ploughs and harrows, drills, forks, shears, hatchets, hoes, hay knives, rabbit traps, rakes, scythes, shovels and spades, spraying compounds, and sheep-wash tobacco, and a number of other things, come in absolutely free of duty, and it is shown that the farmer has been considered in every possible way under the free list introduced by the Minister of Customs. Now, with regard to the duties that are put on the farmer's products, we are told that they are absolutely illusory, and that he will get no benefit whatever from them. First of all, in looking at division 4 of the Tariff - agricultural products and groceries, it wilt be seen that nearly the whole of the articles there included are such as are raised from the soil ; with the exception of some three or four items contained in the free list everything the farmer can produce has a duty put upon it. As to animals introduced for the purpose of improving our breeds, and in the case of isinglass, rennet, rock salt, and manures, it will be found that these articles are included in the free list. Almost everything the farmer produces is subject to a duty, and on the question as to whether or not these duties will be worth much to him, when I deal with their value presently, it. will be seen whether the farmer has been ignored or overlooked in the preparation of this Tariff. We are told that these duties are of no use to the farmer, but if that is so, how is it that there is such an outcry in New Zealand at the present time? The day after this Tariff was announced in this Chamber, a telegram was received from New Zealand containing the following : - </para>

The Tariff, in the average, would put about 22 per cent, on to the cost of exports from New Zealand, and producers are almost certain to lose an enormous portion of their trade ?

                <para>If the Tariff proposals are adopted, New Zealand must look forward to a considerable shrinkage of its Australian trade in the near future. A careful examination of the figures shows that the Tariff is expressly framed with a view to the exclusion of New Zealand products. As the politicians of this country have shown such indifference to the problems connected with Australian federation they have only themselves to blame if they awake too late to the facts of the situation. The Commonwealth cannot be expected to show especial tenderness to the colony that studiously held aloof from the fiscal discussion which led. to Australian unity. </para>

To show whether these duties will be of any use to Australian producers, and to prove how shamefully New South Wales producers have been wronged by . the fiscal policy of the last few years, I propose to quote a few figures. In the years 1897, 1898, and 1899, of the produce of the farm, the dairy, and the orchard - I strike out sugar and rice - nearly the whole of which could have been raised in New South Wales, there was imported no less than Â£11,851,689 worth. </para>

                        <para>- These figures are absolutely correct, and are signed by the Government Statist. The sum of Â£46,190 would not have been a bad little item in the hands of the housewives and farmers of New South Wales during those three years. Although New South Wales can grow maize as well as any country in the world, yet we find that in three years Â£565,716 worth of maize was imported. No wonder New Zealand is lamenting the loss of this trade; but that feeling of loss will be turned into a feeling of joy amongst the maize growers of New South Wales. In potatoes, New South Wales imported Â£621,745 worth; in fresh vegetables, Â£108,660 worth ; in fresh fruits - surely she can grow enough fruit for herself- Â£664,521 worth ; in hay, chaff, and straw, Â£839,991 worth; in meat, canned, potted, and preserved, Â£290,573 worth. In butter - the great butter industry, in which New South Wales is held to be going ahead of "Victoria - she imported in those three years Â£138,039 worth ; in cheese, Â£322,118 worth; in milk, condensed and preserved, Â£215,081 worth; in flour, Â£1,173989 worth. Yet, with all these enormous figures, we are told that protection will do the farmer no good, and that the New South Wales farmer is satisfied and is flourishing. </para>

                        <para>- I apologize, if the honorable member is ashamed of the name I have given to him. In those three years, in dried fruit, New South Wales imported Â£89,083 worth. Of raisins and currants, there were imported Â£266,154 worth ; and of canned and bottled fruits, Â£44,513 worth. The next item, " jams and jellies," is one which affects the honorable member for South Sydney, and no doubt he would be glad to see the duty imposed. The value of jams and jellies imported was Â£126,950. No one can deny that every one of these things could be produced in New South Wales. The total value of raisins and currants, canned and bottled fruits, and jams and jellies, was Â£526,700. Of bran and pollard there was imported Â£106,746 worth. Altogether we find, as I said before, that there was imported into New South Wales during that period produce to the value of Â£11,851,689, or at the rate of nearly Â£4,000,000 a year; and all of these commodities might have been produced by the farmers of New South Wales. We find also that there was imported into Victoria produce to the value of no less than Â£5,000,000. The Federal Parliament ought to assist the farmers not only with regard to the primary products, as they may be termed, but by stimulating them in every possible way to produce the articles which I have enumerated, under a diversified system of farming which should overlook nothing, but, as in Canada and in the United States, enable us to supply all our own wants. It is all nonsense to say that these duties are delusive or illusory. We know that in California there has been immense competition in connexion with the production of some of the goods which have been largely imported into Australia. In California they already have 8,000,000 acres under irrigation, and there are some millions more in connexion with which the works are not yet complete. We find that raisins, which some years ago were selling in the markets in California at 8 cents per pound, are now produced for 1Â£ cent per pound, which yields a good profit to the grower. Prunes, which brought from 24 to 30 cents per pound, are now produced at 6 or 7 cents per pound, and also yield a good profit to the grower. If we were to open our ports to the fruit-growers of California and other similar places, how could our growers possibly compete with their products at such rates as I have quoted ? In the Argentine Republic, and in California and in the East, we should find very serious competitors if we were to throw our ports open. So far as wheat is concerned, an import duty would protect the wheat-grower only at very rare intervals, but I have not the least doubt that the Commonwealth Government will see the necessity of studying the requirements of the wheat-growers, by finding for them the best markets for their produce, providing facilities for exportation, and by making arrangements for giving them cheap transit both by sea and land. The best way, however. in which we can help the wheat-grower, is by bringing population into the country, and thus giving him a home market for his produce, and rendering it unnecessary for him to send it abroad. We cannot bring this population here and maintain it here unless we diversify our industries. I think. I have said enough in connexion with the New South Wales imports to show that protection will benefit the farmers of New South Wales, and that they need protection as much as do any other class in the community. With regard to the duties which the farmer will have to pay, I have mentioned that all the smaller things which he uses are free. He will, certainly, have to pay 15 per cent, duties on his implements and machinery, but looking at the matter from the Victorian point of view, he will have to pay less than formerly, because a few years ago the duty on implements and machinery was 35 per cent., and it was the Attorney-General and myself who were largely instrumental in securing the reduction down to a percentage which we contended then, and which we submit now, is only a revenue duty. The result of helping the manufacturers of agricultural implements is this : that we have stimulated the industry, and have now workshops able to produce articles which are better suited to the needs of the country than those manufactured in other parts of the world. The farmers come into touch with the manufacturers, and are able to procure implements which suit the soil and the particular circumstances under which they have to work, whilst if repairs are needed, or anything goes wrong with the machinery, the workshops are handy, and everything can be set right readily and inexpensively. The establishment of these workshops amongst us had also had the effect of placing upon the market a number of new implements. The inventive genius of implement makers has been stimulated, and they have given us a number of implements specially suited to our needs. Should we have had the mallee stump-jumping plough or the scrub roller, or a variety of similar implements specially suited to our requirements, if it had not been for the facts I have mentioned] Should we have had, produced by local manufacturers, harvesters which are able to compete with the reapers and binders, and by means of which a farmer, with the aid of one man, can reap 200 acres or 300 acres of wheat, and put it into the bags straight away? All these things tend to show that by stimulating our inventive geniuses and our manufacturers, we are giving the farmer substantial help. So far as the question of reapers and binders is concerned, that example has been quoted because it is such a glaring one. Where we have not put on a duty the farmer has had to pay exorbitant prices, but where we have put on a duty local manufactures have been stimulated and the farmer has been enabled to get, at a cheap rate, an implement suited to his requirements. Not only American trusts, but English trusts have combined to keep up the prices of reapers and binders. A friend of mine went to Hornsby's office in London and gave them his cheque for Â£27 for a reaper and binder. They asked him where it was to go to, and when he. said that he wanted it sent to Victoria they told him they were very sorry they could not do business with him, and that he would have to buy his machine from their agent in Victoria. Although he had actually bought the machine in London he had to take back his cheque, and come out here and pay Â£56 for a machine. That was some years ago. </para>

                        <para>- -All sorts of twine is manufactured here. I believe that Russian twine is very dear, 8Â£d. per lb., and is not a whit better than that manufactured in the State. I am informed by the Bendigo tradesmen to whom I referred, that twine manufactured here, 650 feet to the lb., is equal to any that comes into the country. Forsyth, of Sydney, procured machinery for making this twine ; and the result was that the American Twine Trust -sent out 500 tons of the article, with orders that it was to be sold at whatever it would bring in order that Forsyth's twine might not be allowed to go into use. There would be a similar result in all other industries. If manufactured articles were allowed to come in, free of duty, from countries where there was cheaper money, labour, and appliances, the factories here would be wiped out, and then the goods would be sold at .any price the foreign manufacturers liked to fix. I know as much of representative farmers as any one, and I never yet found those of Victoria against a fair and reasonable protective duty, which is all that is asked for here. The farmers are .always in favour of such a Tariff; but duties do not trouble them very much, so long as they are given a fair water supply and have fair seasons. I hope the Federal Government will look at the matter from that point of view. What the farmers want is to get into direct touch with their consumers, and that can be best attained by having a home market. One way of getting farmers into touch with their customers would be by endeavouring to abolish the middle men, who are so dear to the hearts of our freetrade friends, and who are the " caterpillars" who spoil the farmer's profit. The Commonwealth Government can do much in the way of helping the farmer in regard to the export trade and outside markets. Their proposals with regard to bonuses for production are admirable. This plan has often been spoken of before, but it has not hitherto, been possible of achievement, owing to the markets being so circumscribed. We cannot expect that manufacturers of agricultural implements, or any other articles required for production, will come out here and establish factories, if they are to compete against the world ; and the proposal to give a bonus on the production of iron, reapers. and binders, and other patent machinery and implements, is one which I think will work well for the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The protective duty is not to be given at first, but only when the industries have attained such -a position that they are able to supply the Commonwealth with machinery. But that is a question which this House will have to consider. A duty will not be put on without the consent of the House ; but if a duty be put on without consent, the House can stop it, and see that none is imposed until the industries are fairly and properly established. In Victoria no Government have ever turned a deaf ear to the farmers' requirements, but all have helped them in every possible way by providing cheap land, and holding over rents. In times of fire, flood, or drought farmers have never come to the Government without receiving fair treatment, and that will, no doubt, continue. If we are not to have these duties, how are we going to raise money? There is no doubt that we have to raise Â£7,500,000 on imports. By shifting the incidence, we do not shift the tax, because the people will still have to pay. If gentlemen on the other side of the House desire to change the Tariff very much, they will have to look forward to a federal income tax and a land tax. It must not be forgotten that it is not the Commonwealth, but the needs and the necessities of the States, which is causing the expense. If the Commonwealth does not raise the money it will have to be raised by the States Governments, and the people will still have to pay. We have been told of New South Wales, but from what I can see of the way matters are drifting there, that State will require the surplus revenue just as much as will any other State in the Commonwealth. New South Wales cannot go on borrowing for ever, or, like a spendthrift, be selling land continually, but, to meet her new expenditure, will have to get money in some other way. It seems to me that the Treasurer of New South Wales will be as glad of the Â£1,500,000, or whatever the sum may be, as will the Treasurer of any of the other States. I should like to ask again what good free-trade can do the farmer ? I have asked that question at meeting after meeting, and have never yet had a reply, much less a satisfactory reply. Free-trade will not raise the price of the farmers' produce one fraction, and he will have to compete in the same markets. </para>

                <para>Mr. McCOLL. - If the honorable member does not want a duty on sugar, I am sure the House will be glad to accommodate him, because it is only out of consideration for him and his colleagues that the Government have been induced to put a higher duty on sugar than they otherwise would have cared to impose. The honorable member for North Sydney, in the very excellent speech he delivered last week - and he is always a fair man - proposed to reduce the duties by 5, 10, and 15 per cent. Do honorable members think that the consumer would get his goods at1d. less if those reductions were made ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I was a member of a Government which proposed a primage duty of 1 per cent., and if there was one matter which made that Government more unpopular than any other, it was that. The honorable member, however, proposes to impose a 3Â£ per cent, primage for the whole Commonwealth. Much as I respect the honorable member, and give him credit for sincerity, I do not think his scheme, will do. His idea is that we should reduce duties by 10 or 15 per cent. ; put Id. more excise on beer and 3d. on tobacco, and be content with Â£1,000,000 less revenue. Taking the Government proposals and comparing them with the Tariff which has prevailed in Victoria tip to the present time - and I am speaking now as a Victorian - I find that there are 82 increases in the Commonwealth list, and, as far as I have been able to discover, there are some 78 reductions. There are very large reductions indeed upon articles of ordinary use. Some 30 items are unchanged, or but slightly altered, while, in addition to many of the reductions, 16 increases are in favour of the farmer. I am afraid I have not put my views very clearly before the House, but I want to say that while I do not agree with this Tariff in all its details, I believe that the Government have made an honest and fair attempt to carry out the promises contained in the Maitland speech. They have had a most difficult task to perform in reconciling the varying policies, the varying conditions and prospects of the several States. I am sure that the Treasurer and his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, would not care to go through the work again. After all, these are proposals only. The Tariff is not submitted as a perfect scheme, but is put before us in order that we may exercise our judgment, and in order that the light of discussion may be thrown upon it, so that, under the circumstances of the Commonwealth we may produce a fairly good Tariff. We cannot hope to produce one that will give satisfaction to every one, or even to any one ; we can only try to consider the needs of the present hour. While honorable members are entitled to give full expression to their views, yet when this discussion is over I hope we shall be able to go into committee right away and enter upon the consideration of details. We are promised, however, by the leader of the Opposition, that if he is defeated in the opening engagement he is going, like the Boers in South Africa, to wage a guerilla warfare from every kopje, and to test every detail line by line, and even stump the country. He looks to another power behind him to thwart the will of "Parliament. Meantime business is being complicated by the uncertainty which prevails.

                        <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. The honorable member for Echuca asserted in the course of his speech, that I am a squatter not a farmer. My answer to that statement is, that I have 600 acres in Tasmania under the plough every year, and that I employ ten ploughmen! That should be a complete answer to the honorable member's statement. Another assertion made by him is, that as a land-owner I advocated in the Tasmanian Parliament the imposition of a duty of 40s. per head upon cattle, and some 3s. per head upon sheep. My answer to that statement is, that I was the only member of the House of Assembly who voted for and advocated continually the repeal of the stock tax, some five years "go. </para>

                        <para>- I must say that I sympathize with those would-be leaders of public opinion in this State who are so anxious that, as soon as possible, the mouths of free-trade members should be shut. No doubt, they have the feeling that free-traders are poaching unduly on their preserves. They have had things all their own way in this State for a number of years, and naturally they object now that light should be let in, and that some information, to which hitherto they have not had access, should toe supplied to the Victorian public. I am not sure that I should have inflicted a speech on the House at this juncture if the Minister for Trade and Customs had not, in his usual emphatic manner, thrown down the gauntlet of protection. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard a great deal about Germany and its protectionist policy.. If there is any country in Europe in which protection has done any good, and in which the policy should be highly popular, it is Germany. There is a section of the German Parliament somewhat similar to our Labour Party here, numbering, at the present time, over 40 members. These members are representatives of a great labour federation in Germany - the Social Democratic Federation - and I may say that every election results in an increase in their numbers. The Social Democratic Federation of Germany, like the Labour party of Australia, has a platform, and here is one of the planks of that platform - </para>

                        <para>- That was the intention at one time, and under the stimulus of that idea people undoubtedly thronged into Melbourne. Under the stimulus of borrowed millions, industries were gradually expanded, and they took in a large number of the young men, who were flocking from the country and deserting those means of production which are natural to the country, and which ought to be natural for many years to come. The result was that the rents of property rose, and more buildings had to be provided to supply the wants of the people who were coming in. That meant a demand for land, and there we had the beginning of the land boom. It was simply a result of the policy of developing Melbourne by protection, and by the borrowing of those millions. Therefore, when honorable members wish to place to the credit of the boom all the calamities that have overtaken the country they should realize, in the first place, that the fiscal policy of Victoria is directly responsible for the boom. </para>

                        <para>- There was a reflex action in New South Wales, but, as the honorable member knows, it had by no means the same serious dimensions it had in Victoria. We now find that the calamity of the boom which overtook Victoria sent the minds of the people back again, by a natural process, to those industries on which, after all, her prosperity rests. There was a general cry - " Back to the rural industries" ; and accordingly we find that such industries as butter-making were developed in a remarkable way. It is beyond question that the development of that particular industry in Victoria has been closely associated with the rally which has been made within recent years. </para>

                        <para>- I have been somewhat amused if not edified by the various comparisons which have been attempted, as between New South Wales and Victoria, by means of statistics. It is very hard indeed to get at the truth in such a way. We have had so many statistics thrown at our heads that we may be excused if we have not grasped the full purport of them all. But, I think we may come to the conclusion that as between Victoria and New South Wales, at any rate, there is verv little indeed to choose. In some respects the one State may have an advantage, and, in some respects, the other State ; but so far as the direct benefits of a fiscal policy are concerned, more particularly with reference to employment and wages, I defy any one to say that Victoria is any better off than New South Wales. If that much is conceded, I say unhesitatingly, that it discredits protection. What we were always given to understand in Victoria was that under protection the country would be a great deal better off than any other country under free-trade conditions.' Protection, it was said, was to be a great improvement upon free-trade ; but now we find that those who advocate a protectionist policy are simply on the defensive when confronted with the condition of New South Wales. But protectionists ought to be able to carry the war into the enemy's country, and to show most conclusively that their policy has been a much better one than free-trade. I do not think that the most ardent protectionist in Victoria will refuse to admit that protection has not done anything like what was hoped of it. It has not protected the masses. It is not so very long ago that sitting on a platform, with the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, I heard a gentleman, who has practical knowledge of the conditions in London and in Melbourne, as regards the working classes, state in the most unhesitating way that he had seen in Collingwood a state of affairs that was absolutely worse than anything he had ever witnessed in the slums of London. </para>

                        <para>- We will take it at that - that transportation involves waste, and that what is required is the development of the home market. If transportation involves waste, is not that protection for the home market ? If so very much is lost to those people who are transporting goods from one part of the world to another, surely that is an argument rather in favour of free-trade than of protection. We here in Australia have a natural protection sufficient for all practical purposes, and any interference in the way of artificial protection attracts the people from those natural developments that mean prosperity for this or any other country. I now come to the consideration of this question more particularly in regard to the workers. In this respect, my opinion is that if protection had been called by its true name, we should have heard very little of it in Victoria at all. In spite of what the great poet said about a rose by any other name smelling as sweet, there is a great deal indeed in a name. The old lady who. read her Bible, and told her parson that she derived so very much comfort and consolation from "that blessed word Mesopotamia," was in somewhat the same position as many workers in Victoria in regard to the comfort they derive from the equally blessed word, protection. The proper name for this policy is trade restriction. </para>

                        <para>- It carries its meaning on its face. I repeat that if the policy of protection had been termed by its proper name of trade restriction, the workers would not have seen so much in it as they have done, to their disadvantage undoubtedly. I do not pretend that protection - I will use that term, as it is one generally employed - does not benefit some industries. Undoubtedly it does. It would be surprising, if so many determined efforts to foster and' coddle a particular industry were not . rewarded with some measure of success. But what I contend is that protection does not benefit the community as a whole. That is what we are here to consider, not the . interests of any particular class. I would point out that so far as artisans generally are concerned there is confronting them one very serious matter which has to be considered in connexion with this question. When we are urged to create a home market for our farmers, do those who advance that contention realize what inroads upon production machinery is making in those large industries ? It is impossible under the most artificial conditions to enable the masses in our large towns to apply them selves particularly to mechanical production. Machinery makes that impossible. I would therefore ask the protectionists - what are they going to do with the surplus population? I have not yet heard any protectionist indicate a remedy for that growing condition of things. A book published in America two or three years ago deals with the fiscal question in relation to the masses. It deals with the question from an American stand-point, but it puts a most remarkable parallel so far as Australia is concerned. I wish to give the House one or two quotations, and honorable members will see for themselves what a close connexion there is between the position as developed in America by protection, and the position that we are confronted with at the present time. The book is written by Professor Ely, the Professor of Political Economy in the John Hopkins University, Baltimore, one of the principal educational institutions of the United States. Professor Ely is not a freetrader, but he is an opponent of the condition of things created in America by protection, and has written strongly and forcibly in several volumes in connexion with the matter. He points out that in America the cry originally was for protection to infant industries. Here are his words - </para>

Manifestly the period of infancy must end some time, and the infant industry argument is based precisely on the hypothesis that protection is merely a temporary need. </para>

                    <para>Appetite grew with what it fed upon; and the call was for increasing protection. How justify it ? As I said, protectionists began to cast about for another special plea., and they found it, and from about 1840 up to the present we have heard a new war-cry : namely, protection of American labour against "the pauper labour of Europe." "The pauper labour of Europe." I think I have heard that cry in this House several times of late. This is what the Professor has to say with regard to it : - </para>
                    <para>No doubt for party purposes it was an immense improvement. It proceeded upon the hypothesis that the American employer must pay more than his European competitor for labour, and that difference must be made up to him by a tax on foreign competitors ; some, indeed, with a nice air of accuracy, claiming it is a scientific principle that duties should be precisely such in every instance as to equal the difference in cost of labour. It is assumed that if duties fall, American labour must also fall in price, and, like European labour, become pauper labour. One manifest superiority in this new plea is that it does not advocate duties as something temporary, but as something to endure as long as American labour is " dear," and foreign labour is " cheap." Another is the benevolence wrapped up in it, and not merely benevolence. It is benevolence of a superior and unique sort ! Benevolence often means sacrifice on the part of him who exercises it, as when I wear an old coat that I may help educate the orphan child of an old friend. Not so the benevolence of the protective Tariff, for it is warranted never to take a penny from the pockets of its most devoted adherents. They may live in palaces, eat the choicest cuts of roast beef, drink champagne, and be merry while their bank accounts swell ! Have they not done their part ? Are they not the representatives of protection to American labour ? </para>

By no means. He would be a fool to do it. He will first ascertain many other things about business, and he will institute a diligent inquiry into the relative efficiency of northern and southern labour.

                        <para>- What I have quoted is of interest to us in view of the fact that we are confronted with exactly the same cry in the Commonwealth of Australia. I think also that the writer of tins book has shown most conclusively the hollowness of the demand, and the fact that it is unnecessary at any time or under any conditions to protect highly paid labour from cheap labour. The position of workers in Great Britain, as against that of labour on the continent of Europe, shows- that the wages in Great Britain are undoubtedly higher than on the continent. In some of the European countries, such as Italy, wages bear a very low ratio, indeed, to what is paid in Great Britain ; but we do not find that British workmen are suffering from the competition on the part of pauper labour. On the contrary, it has been shown beyond question, and I think admitted even by honorable members sitting behind the Government, that the position of the British worker under free-trade is steadily improving. </para>

The people of this State will show very soon that they have not by any means the remarkable facility for refusing evidence of this kind which is possessed by some honorable members. I trust that I have made my motives and sympathies in regard to the Tariff no longer a matter of conjecture. As a citizen of the Commonwealth, I have stated what I consider ought to be the policy of the Commonwealth. </para>

I wish, in conclusion, to say a few words in regard to the Tariff in its relation to the State I represent. In Western Australia there is only one opinion about it, and that is that, so far as that State is concerned, it is simply iniquitous in its incidence. We have had there already a Tariff which has. unduly pressed the masses. </para>

                        <para>- We do not intend to leave it to a revenue Tariff. We intend such a Tariff to be only the beginning. But we do not want to create vested interests in Australia which will make even a revenue Tarin0 impossible. I come now to my last and greatest objection to protection. In the United States we have an object lesson which ought to make every honorable member pause and seriously consider the position. The policy which has been adopted there has meant the demoralization of the country and the corruption of its politics. America is nearer a revolution than is any other country in the world, simply and solely because the vested interests which have grown up behind the wall of protection have got the country absolutely and entirely in their grip - the masses, the workers, the Judges in the law courts, and even the Legislature itself. I may be speaking somewhat strongly, but I intend to produce evidence in support of my statements. There is a series of interesting volumes published in America upon questions of the day. No. 53 of these volumes has for its subject "The Tariff and its Evils." The writer is John H. Allen. </para>

Within the last fifteen years we have seen men occupying the highest positions in the Government of the United States who were not only purchasable, but who had been purchased, and at a very small price. I know what I say, and mean it. The Cabinets during the same period have been so rotten with corruption that the presence in them of two or three men of integrity could not save them. </para>

                        <para>- It is well known that the influence of these trusts and syndicates controls America, socially, financially and political. Things have got to such a pass there, that when legislators find things are dull, they get a Bill drawn that aims at some of the trusts, and immediately people outside induce those enterprising politicians to leave the thing alone. I am not stating anything but what is borne out by the actual state of affairs in America. Any one can see that the position created by a Tariff wall must develop such a condition of things. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that every member of this House has come into it with clean hands, and has thoroughly clean hands, and I hope it may never be said of the Australian Legislature that any of its members can be described in other terms than these. But we have already an indication of the possibilities in store for us, in the agitation going on outside of this House, by forces that fortunately are not sufficiently strong yet to influence legislation. Allow this Tariff wall, behind which they may increase in strength, and we can easily imagine the state of affairs which may arise. The United States of America points a moral for us which we cannot afford to ignore at this juncture, and honorable members opposite know well enough that the state of affairs there is largely attributable to the protective policy of that country. If such is the case, and if a danger like this confronts us, I say we have no other course open to us than, at any cost, to take such steps as will make such a condition of affairs as exists in America at the present time impossible to the Commonwealth of Australia. For the reasons I have indicated, perhaps at undue length, but I trust not without some interest to honorable members, I wish to say that I shall most unhesitatingly support the motion now before the House. </para>

                    <para>- We have listened, I am sure, with attention to all the speeches made, and especially to the latest by the honorable member for Perth, who, according to his own statement, represents in this House an example of one who was a protectionist and who has become a very strong freetrader. The only remark I have to make in regard to that is one which I am sure honorable members will forgive me for, because there have been so many protectionists in these eastern States who have changed their views when they have gone to "Western Australia. I desire therefore, to ask the honorable member whether the change in his views, which he has told us of, took place somewhere near the time when he changed his home from the eastern to the western side of Australia? I ask the question because a large number of people who were protectionists in Eastern Australia, have, when they have gone to the western State, become free-traders. I want to' say also that that bears out my opinion in regard to this fiscal question - that there is no real principle about it, and that it is merely a question of pounds, shillings, and pence, and which policy will pay us best. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member gets up will he launch out on the Tariff in one moment ? He had better hold his tongue, and not interrupt by asking whether what one is saying is practical when one has scarcely commenced to say anything. Motions of want of confidence are always very carefully prepared and are designed to please undecided independent members, who wish to support the Government in the most difficult position. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say the wobblers at all. Those who have not pledged themselves and who the Opposition may think would like to support the Government. The desire in the wording of a motion of no confidence is to place these honorable members in the most difficult position possible. That is the general plan adopted, I believe, by those who frame these motions. I have had no experience in framing them. Whether for good or for ill, all the time I was in the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia I was on the Treasury benches, and although there were many motions of want of confidence they were always framed by others and directed against me. Whatever the form of the motion is the object is exactly the same ; the bait is skilfully arranged so as to catch the most fish. I discard for the moment the terms of this motion. I do not care twopence about its terms ; it is a motion of want of confidence and those who vote for it say deliberately to the people of this country, by their vote, that they want a change of Government ; and it will be understood so, of course. There is no use beating about the bush. Every one who votes for or against the motion knows very well that he is voting either to support the Government or to put the honorable members opposite in their place. Every one is agreed - and every one will agree no doubt all through this debate - that a certain amount of revenue must be obtained in order to carry on the Government of the Commonwealth. The Government say that their desire is, while raising the necessary revenue, to assist the industries of the country. </para>

                        <para>-While we are devising means for raising the revenue, at the same time we are devising means for assisting the industries of the country. Our object is to build up a self-reliant people, and not to be dependent on others for all those things which we can produce as well as they can. We should not depend on the labour of the people of other lands, but should produce everything we can for ourselves - thus, not only building up a self-reliant community but giving large employment to our own people. To read the harangues and speeches of persons outside the House as well as inside, one would think that free-trade as they call it - it is no free-trade at all, as everyone knows - means lighter taxation. After listening to some of these most interesting harangues many persons go away with the idea that the policy they have listened to, means no taxation at all. </para>

                        <para>- We all know that whatever fiscal policy finds a place on our statute-book the taxation will be the same. We must have the requisite amount of money in order to carry on the public service. If the same services are to be given, the payments will have to be practically the same. The plan which the Government believe in - that is, to get the requisite money by a system of taxation which has been fittingly termed, I think, by the Prime Minister, " moderate protection " - will stimulate industry, whereas our opponents would leave every industry to sink or swim without any regard or assistance from the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I think they were. The honorable member knows very little about Western Australia, and I would advise him not to make assertions that are not quite correct. The worker's candidate for Fremantle was an avowed protectionist, and although he was beaten by my friend, the honorable member for Fremantle, who ran on the free-trade ticket, there were a great many protectionists in that constituency. The free-traders won the day, as a rule, but they did not receive a unanimous vote, because there are a veiy large number of protectionists throughout the Western State - even on the gold-fields. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but we cannot ignore their votes. I always thought that the workers were protectionists, because the very basis of their policy is protection. I cannot understand how those who adopt protection as the very foundation of all their organizations should be in favour of free-trade. Is trades unionism based on free-trade?

                        <para>- I do not know why honorable members should interrupt. If they are amused, they might content themselves with laughing. Those of us who have had any thing to do with public life and the management of public finances know that it must be a matter of very great difficulty to frame one Tariff to meet the varied conditions of six different States. The very first consideration, which we must all admit and realize, is that the volume of taxable imports has been, by federation and the consequent inter-State free-trade, reduced from Â£63,000,000 to Â£34,000,000. That fact has been stated over and over again in the House by honorable members, including the honorable the Treasurer and the honorable member for North Sydney ; but I do not think that people generally have yet realized that the operation of interState free- trade has removed Â£29,000,000 worth of goods which were formerly at the disposal of the Treasurer for the purposes of taxation. </para>

These goods were available for taxation, and are not available now ; and that is a fact of the greatest importance which we must remember. Then there was an obligation, from which the Government could not honorably get away, to maintain the financial stability of all the States. It was promised in the Federal Convention and out of it - on the hustings and everywhere else throughout the Commonwealth - that the solvency of the States would be protected. </para>

                        <para>- We all understood that the States would be as well off after federation as before, and the two considerations I have presented must not be overlooked or lost sight of for a moment. I am no advocate on personal grounds of asking honorable members to retain the present Government in office. I shall fight as long as I have breath in me for the Government of which I am a member, but I certainly shall not ask any one in this House - and I hope the day will never come when I shall - to vote for any Government on personal grounds. But it would be almost a disaster if there were a change of fiscal proposals now. To submit a new set of Tariff proposals would only make confusion more confounded. It would interfere with trade, and carry confusion into the finances of all the States. Some may regard an argument of that kind as not of much good, and may construe it into an appeal to keep the present Government in power for other than State reasons. That, however, is not my object. What I mean is that the Opposition did not challenge the Government when they had the opportunity on the Governor's speech at the opening of Parliament. They did not then say a word about a vote of no confidence ; in fact, they were afraid to do so. The Opposition waited until four or five months had passed, when a certain amount of legislation had been got through, and until the Government brought down the fiscal proposals, which were sorely needed by the community, and of great importance to every man doing business throughout the country. Now we find the Opposition making long speeches, and causing a good deal of time to be lost, while the fiscal question is kept hovering about, and must remain neither settled nor unsettled apparently for a long time to come. So far as I am able to judge such a course as that is not likely to promote the interests of the country. It would have been far better, if the Opposition intended to submit such a motion, to have challenged the Government at the first, and to have undertaken the labour and responsibility of bringing the fiscal proposals before the country. Instead of taking that course, the Opposition left the labour and responsibility to the Government! and now, after a great deal of anxiety and trouble has been devoted to the preparation of the Tariff, they make this the occasion on which to test whether or not the Administration possesses the confidence of the country. At the beginning, the Government either had or had not the confidence of the country, and the Opposition ought to have tested the question at that time and not waited till the session was half through. We must all realize that some Â£8,000,000 or Â£9,000,000 of revenue has to be raised, and it is generally admitted - I never heard any one say a word to the contrary - that that amount must be raised through customs and excise. </para>

I am aware that my honorable friend the member for North Sydney has set forth a scheme by which he proposes to raise not much more than Â£8,000,000. But on this matter I prefer to take the opinion of my right honorable colleague the Treasurer, who has had an opportunity of looking into the subject, and should be in a better position than any one else in this House to know what is required. We all know sufficient of the Treasurer to be aware that he would not ask for a penny more than is necessary. He is more likely to err in the other direction. </para>

                        <para>- [ do not say that it is a new development. At any rate, we have the fact that there is no provision for it except that which I caused to be inserted in the Constitution, and which has been so much abused, whereby Western Australia will be able for a short time to provide for her wants. Even with the proposed Customs revenue of about Â£7,500,000, and the revenue from excise amounting to about Â£1,500,000, there will still be an aggregate deficiency of about Â£600,000 a year for the three States I have named. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the position is bad enough. If we were to attempt to do what the honorable member for North Sydney proposed, we should only make it worse. It serves to show how difficult has been the task which has had to be faced. I know very well that my right honorable and learned friends the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs have not only done their best, but have done many things, which they would not have attempted otherwise, in order to give to the States as nearly as possible the amount they have hitherto received from customs and excise. In order to make myself clearly understood by those who may read my remarks, I should like to refer in one or two words to facts which are not new to the House. Last year, hi round figures, the total value of our imports was about Â£63,000,000. The Inter-State imports, no longer available for taxation, amounted to about Â£29,000,000; leaving a sum of Â£34,000,000 for the purposes of taxation. It is estimated, however, that there will be a reduction of Â£5,000,000 or Â£6,000,000 in the value of imports next year owing to the operation of Inter-State free-trade and internal production. Then we have a free list of Â£8,000,000, which makes a total, say, of Â£1 3,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- In my estimate it is set down at Â£8,000,000. When we deduct Â£13,000,000 from the sum of Â£34,000,000 which I have named, the taxable value is reduced to Â£21,000,000. Then we have Â£2,000,000 in value for narcotics and stimulants, which are exceptionally highly taxed, leaving Â£19,000,000 for taxation purposes. Narcotics and stimulants are likely to produce about Â£3,000,000 out of the Â£7,500,000 of Customs revenue, so that we have a balance of Â£4,500,000 to obtain from Â£19,000,000 of taxable value. </para>

                        <para>- I think I have included everything. In order to raise Â£4,500,000 from Â£19,000,000 of taxable value we should have to impose uniform duties of 23 per cent. If the generality of people who have been accustomed to low duties saw 23 per cent, staring them in the face when they opened the Tariff, they would say at once - " What terribly high duties !" Still, with a free list of Â£8,000,000, and reduced imports to the extent I have named, it would be necessary to have all-round duties of 23 per cent, on the Â£19,000,000 of taxable value. When people talk of the duties being high they should remember that the Government have only about Â£19,000,000 to tax, and that from that amount they have to obtain Â£4,500,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with the Treasurer's statement. I am showing what would happen if we were to adopt the drag-net, and say that everything should be taxed. If there were uniform duties on every article included in that Â£19,000,000 of value, 23 per cent, would be the average rate. It is well to remember that fact when we hear so much about high duties being imposed. Some one has suggested that the Tariff proposals of the Government should be referred to a vote of the people. I do not think that would carry us much further. If one were to ask any ordinary person whether he would like to be taxed or whether he would like to go free, he would not be long in obtaining an answer. A man would say naturally that he would like to go free. If any person could promise that the Government would be carried on, and that the Â£8,000,000 or Â£9,000,000 of revenue required would be raised without affecting any one, that person would be likely to get the support of the people. During this debate we have heard a great deal, especially from my right honorable and learned friend the leader of the Opposition, about the taxation of the "poor man. " I. notice that honorable members always indulge in statements of that kind when they believe they can do themselves any good by it. We are told that the " poor man " is being affected ; that we are taxing the poor man's food. On this occasion we have had the "bold pioneer" put forward. We have been told of the man who goes out to subdue the wilderness, and of the man in the bush with his "pannikin." One would really think from the utterances of the leader of the Opposition and certain other honorable members that they enjoyed an absolute monopoly of sympathy with the poor man, and that no one upon the Government side of the House cared a solitary straw for him. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the leader of the Opposition what he knows about the bold pioneer or the man with the pannikin in the bush ? His experience of the bold pioneer consists in having read of him. What has he ever done for the poor man with the pannikin in the bush ? Certainly he has talked a good deal about him, but talk is very cheap. I should like a little practical illustration of what he has done. It is not those who talk the loudest who have done the most for that class of individual. In this connexion I should like to see a little sympathy exhibited in our daily lives without so much talk about it. </para>

                        <para>- I want to expose those who use this cheap way of advertising themselves as friends of the pioneer in the backblocks, who never were in the backblocks, and have had no experience of the men who have worn out their lives in the interior of this great continent. If some of those who talk the most went out into the backblocks they would soon get lost. I should like to refer to the proposals of the honorable member for North Sydney. It seems to me that they absolutely prove the case of the Government. I was very glad, indeed, to read them, because they differ very little in the main from those submitted by the Ministry. They certainly follow upon the same lines. In reading the speech of the honorable member I did not notice any reference to a dragnet clause. Does he propose that there shall be one? </para>

                        <para>- I want to make no point that is not right. I am very much obliged to the honorable member for North Sydney, for having submitted his views in regard to what he thinks would prove a workable Tariff. The twists and turns that he has had to make in order to arrive at the result he desired, show how very difficult was the operation. But even with all the honorable member's knowledge, I question whether he had the same information to guide him, as had the two right honorable gentlemen who framed this Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I am perfectly aware of that. But that does not . get the money out of their pockets. I had to face this difficulty : That if during "the discussion of the Tariff I had advocated the reduction of the duties, every penny we took off would, unless the difference was made up in some other way, make the deficit of the State I represent so much greater. That was not a very pleasant position. The Prime Minister promised in his. speech at Maitland, and on many other occasions, to protect the finances of the States. I can say with knowledge that that has been the keynote of his programme, and his desire throughout. The right honorable gentleman has done his best, but honorable members can see at once, by looking at the figures supplied to them, that it has been found impossible to protect them altogether, because it would have required a Tariff that would have raised a revenue of Â£19,000,000 instead of a revenue of under Â£9,000,000 to give Western Australia the same revenue from customs and excise that she received last year. It was quite impossible for that to be done, and I say that the Prime Minister has done his best and has kept his word. I could not believe that the right honorable gentleman would not keep his word, and I cannot understand how men who know him and are accustomed to call him friend, can stand up in the House and by direct word or by interjection, say that the right - honorable gentleman has broken faith, and not kept his word. To say such a thing is to brand him as a charlatan and imposter, and nothing less. I know that the right honorable gentleman is incapable of any such behaviour. He has done his very best to protect the interests of the States, and yet with a customs revenue of Â£7,500,000 and an excise revenue of Â£1,500,000 he has not been able entirely to protect the revenues of the States. The proposal more than protects the revenue of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, but in the case of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania there will be a deficit, and that notwithstanding the fact that the total customs and excise revenue provided for is Â£1,179,748 more than was sufficient to give all the States the revenue they received- in 1900. When honorable members consider that fact they will see how difficult the position has been. With all respect and deference, I say that the Government have made an honest effort to deal with the very troublesome and exceptional circumstances they have had to face. </para>

                        <para>- The high duties have been in many cases rendered necessary, as I have said before, through the value of taxable imports being decreased, and through the demands for expenditure having increased to some extent. When it is remembered that we had previously a taxable value of Â£63,000,000 and now find ourselves, after deducting a considerable free list and other things, and making provision for Inter-State freetrade, with a taxable value of only about Â£19,000,000, honorable members will at once see the difficulties of the situation. It has been said that if this money is not collected it will be in the pockets of the people. That is so. We can always say that, but it is not so easy to get it out. It is a point we are bound to consider because it gives a little salve to the States. If there is a means of providing for the collection of the extra amount, they are able to do it without taxing the people to a greater extent than they have hitherto been taxed. But in Queensland and Tasmania there is nd machinery provided for that purpose. In the case of Western Australia, I appealed to the members of the Convention, and I was able to provide machinery for that purpose. If it had not been so, the Western Australian Government would have had to curtail their expenditure by about Â£250,000 at the present time, and they would require to bring in new estimates. </para>

The honorable and learned member does not know the circumstances of Western Australia as well as I do, or he would be aware that in Western Australia we have reduced taxation every year for some years past. Since 1893, and during all the years of prosperity that have come to Western Australia, we have never added a single penny to customs taxation in that State, while we have taken off a great deal. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite willing to believe that improvement can be made even in a Tariff proposed by this Government. It is very likely, considering all the trouble, all the hurry skurry, and all the difficulties, that there are some things which it will be all the better to amend. If I were at liberty to speak for myself, I think I could make some suggestions. We must look after the necessities of the States, whatever we do. We have heard a good deal during the debate ; we hear a good deal outside, and we shall hear more before the division bells ring, about taking the money out of the pockets of the people. Some persons go even so far as to term it robbing the people. There is a good deal of clap-trap about that kind of talk. In a country like this, where there is no standing army or navy to support, and where all the revenue is expended for the advantage of the country- </para>

                        <para>- I think so - where it is expended in improving the national estate, and in giving employment, here, there, and everywhere, with the one great object of improving the condition of the people, there is a good deal of humbug about this talk of taking the money out of the pockets of the people. I look upon the Government in many respects as merely a distributor. The Government get the money on the first of the month, and distribute it again. We get it out of the pockets of the people, and it goes back into their pockets. I do not say that it always gets back into the same pocket - and, perhaps, that is a very good thing. We get it from those who have plenty, and put it into the pockets of those who have not so much, and I think there is a good deal of " robbing Peter to pay Paul " about it, after all. </para>

                        <para>- When the leader of the Opposition and other honorable members on the free-trade side were speaking of this Tariff, they omitted to take into account the fact that where the duties are protective - and there is no doubt some of them are moderately protective - the greater part of the goods are being made in Australia at the present time, or they soon will be, and the duties, therefore, will not operate in the way they represent. I believe that the effect of this Tariff, together with Inter-State free-trade, and the extended market that will be afforded under it, will be that industries will grow up, not only in Melbourne and Sydney, but in every large centre. The result will be that prices will be lowered rather than increased, that population will be settled in the country, and employment at fair rates of wages will be available. That is what I believe to be the prospect before us, and I consider that it affords a far better outlook than that which has been presented to us by my honorable friend the member for North Sydney, who desires to frame a Tariff under which more goods shall be imported - goods that we could make here. It is far better for us to adopt the policy that will give moderate protection to those who are engaged in the industries of the country, no matter what they may be. </para>

                        <para>- Our object is to so order our affairs that this Commonwealth shall not be dependent for ever upon the exertions of the people of other countries. If we have the land here, and the material, and the men, why cannot we meet our own requirements, instead of importing from other countries, and taking the bread out of the mouths of our own people, and thus allow others to flourish upon the wealth produced here ? Although I am a member of the Government, and desire to support it in every way I can, I do not wish any one to run away with the idea that I approve of every word in this Tariff. It would be ridiculous to suppose that any man would not, if he could, make some alteration in the Tariff, but the subject is a very difficult and complicated one, and we have had to do the very best we could under the circumstances. </para>

I can readily explain my position when I tell honorable members that I was instrumental several years ago in introducing into Western Australia what was, at any rate to some extent, a free breakfast table. I do not know that I ever got a great deal of credit for it from some people, but it will be accorded me by-and-by. I do not seek it, because it is that popularity which follows, and not that which is run after, that is worth having. I laid it down as a principle that articles of food in general use, and not producible in the country, should be free. That was what I considered to be in accordance with a protectionist policy. Did the honorable member for Parkes ever go so far as that? </para>

                        <para>- Kerosene, though not an article of food, is very useful, and has been admitted free into Western Australia for a long time past. Honorable members can see that these articles which I prided myself upon placing upon the free list are taxed under this Tariff, and they will recognise that, as a member of the Government, I must have had serious difficulties to contend with in dealing with the conditions under which the Tariff had to be constructed. I do not know that I need say anything more. I have taken up too much time already, but I have desired to place this matter before honorable members from my own point of view. It seems to me that all the difficulties of the situation created by the introduction of InterState free-trade, the reduction in the value of the goods available for taxation by Â£29,000,000, the necessity of raising revenue, and the necessity of maintaining the stability of the States as far as possible, have to be taken into consideration. All these questions have had to be dealt with, and the difficulties have been almost insuperable owing to the provisions of the Constitution Act. I do not wish to find any particular fault with the Constitution Act, but no doubt great difficulties are created under it. Those who address themselves to this question are in duty bound to make themselves thoroughly acquainted with all the facts of the case - not to select any particular duty, and make up their minds that it is excessive, but look at all the surroundings of the question. I can only hope that we shall arrive at some conclusion as soon as possible. What this country wants is settled legislation, and above all things a settled Tariff. I can only say that, so far as the State I represent is concerned, I do not expect that this Tariff will be viewed very favorably, but I believe that the more it is understood, the more people will be contented with it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not- going to disfranchise Victoria, and I shall come to that point in a moment. I am now unfolding my views, if honorable members will give me a chance. I had the honour, like some of my right honorable and honorable friends, to be a member of the great Federal Convention. It was then clearly seen that, in carrying out a Commonwealth Federation such as we have formed, there was a danger, in the matter of popular politics, of one State, by a bare majority, putting its policy on all the other States. But the fact has always been recognised that in dealing with great public questions within the Commonwealth the different conditions of the States ought to be considered, and that no mere brute majority, so to speak, should force a policy on a reluctant country. </para>

                        <para>- We had an election, as we all know, on the 29th of last March, and I want to revert - again I have to say I am sorry the Prime Minister is not in his place - to the incidents of that election. A great many of the men who were returned in the different States were elected, not altogether on their fiscal principles, but because they were public men who had earned a reputation in the respective States, and whom the people believed they could trust to give fair play to the different States. Now, what is the position taken up by the Prime Minister of this country ? He actually in his public addresses went so far as to say that notwithstanding our differences on this fiscal question, the financial exigencies of the States were so great that we were bound to have a practically revenue Tariff. He went further - honorable members will recollect the whole of the history of these events - he said that in rallying round this great Commonwealth, we ought to put aside these differences between free-traders and protectionists. He said there was no reason why I, for instance, or why any man on this side should not join forces with the Government in trying to do - what? To legislate equitably, especially on this financial question, for the whole of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable member. I sit on this side of the House for this reason - that although I was satisfied at the time with the assurances of the Prime Minister and some of the other Ministers, I said in nry public addresses that in order to keep the Prime Minister to his promise, it was necessary that we, the free-traders of Australia, should sit on this side and be the watch-dogs, as the honorable member for Parkes called it, in the cause of commercial freedom . But I think too much of the Prime Minister to imagine for one moment that he, in asking myself and others, in his public utterances, to join him and his Ministry in forwarding the legislation of the Commonwealth, would insult me by saying - "You, who have been a free-trader all your life, must sweep away all your principles." He knows me too well - for we have known one another for many years - to think anything of the kind for one moment. Now I come to his speech at Maitland, because I say most distinctly that the constituencies of this country have been badly used. They have been misled ; and the Prime Minister to-day is renegade to the principles he laid down at the general elections. </para>

                        <para>- At the time the Prime Minister made his Maitland speech, recollect, his Ministry had been formed. If he had made the Maitland speech before forming his Ministry, we might have given him credit for the difficulties surrounding his position in forming the Ministry. We might say, and the Prime Minister might have said, that although he had issued his manifesto, yet owing to the exigencies of the situation he had had to alter the constitution of his Ministry. When the 'Prime Minister made that speech at Maitland, some of my friends told me of the possibly insidious character of it, and pointed out how it might be used to create a protective system. I said, " I will believe nothing of the kind." I took the Prime Minister at his word, and I can prove by the very statements he uttered, and which I will quote to the House now, that he distinctly said that there would be no such thing as extreme protection. In fact he said that, although he was a protectionist, he would have to deal principally with the financial situation, and deal with it as a matter of revenue. How could the Government deal principally with the Tariff as a matter of revenue and then make it protective? Will any honorable member tell me that a Tariff is a Tariff for revenue purposes, which, beginning with . Â£100,000 of revenue at 10 per cent., goes on to Â£400,000 at 15 per cent., Â£1,000,000 at 20 per cent., and reaches up to 25 per cent, on the surface, but is so mean and hypocritical that when it is examined it is found that it means 50, 60, 80, and 100 per cent, on some articles. My reason for saying this is that if New South Wales particularly, and, I believe, Victoria also, had known for one moment that there was going to be a Tariff of this description, the position of parties in this House would have been entirely altered. I want to point out to honorable members that although we may have a certain number of protectionists in New South Wales, a large number of them hold protectionist views of a very moderate character ; and we have very few 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, protectionists in that State at all. Furthermore, the great bulk of the manufacturers of New South Wales are absolutely against any protection of any kind whatever. Therefore, I say that we had every reason to think, when the Prime Minister uttered the words he did, that he meant them in the ordinary sense - that he meant them in the face of the different declarations he made. The election was carried on upon the good faith of the Prime Minister's utterances, but I say that those who have trusted to those utterances have been sold. Now I will read those utterances. I have taken out those which bear on this particular question. The Prime Minister said : - </para>

In connexion with many of these items, there is a natural protection of from 10 to 50 per cent, by the over-sea charges. If that does not make up a thoroughly prohibitionist protectionist Tariff in many of the main lines, I do not know what would do so. </para>

                        <para>- It is simply the scarlet of the Victorian Tariff' painted red. If honorable members read through the Victorian Tariff, as I have done,, and examine it with any kind of reason or judgment they will see that the Government have taken off occasionally 5 per cent, from some of the highest duties and put it on to others, and that by the system of composite duties they cover up the whole thing so that no one can understand it. I thank the honorable and learned member for his interjection.. That is just the difference between free-traders and protectionists. We free-traders declare a simple system of finance which the man in the street and every one else can understand ; but the protectionist plan all over the world is to cover up the system and complicate it, so that no one can understand it. It reminds me very much of an interview which I had before I became a member of the State' Parliament, with a distinguished politician, who was also a protectionist. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going very minutely to-night into the details of the Tariff, but I think it is reasonable that at this stage of our proceedings we should take a broad view of Australian interests and say, as men capable of laying down definite principles, what is the proper policy for Australia. I have shown, I think, clearly, that the people throughout Australia who voted for federation, voted on the understanding that there would be a moderate Tariff, chiefly for revenue purposes, and it would be an insult to honorable members who have read and re-read this Tariff, to allow anything except that it has a highly protective incidence. There are three matters that we have to consider: First of all, we have to consider the question of finance ; secondly, we have to consider the industries of the country which have been built up under this system of protection - I will allow that that is a consideration up to a certain point - and then we have to consider the great majority of industries outside the manufactures of Australia. In coming to that question, I wish to disabuse the minds of honorable members of some of the little subterfuges - shall I call them ? - to which my right honorable and learned friend has resorted in placing the position before us. I contend that the true position was not placed before us by him. What did the Minister do at the outset? He quietly took off Â£5,000,000 from the expected imports of the country, as much as to say - " I have got my Tariff already, which is so highly protective that it will, reduce the imports by Â£5,000,000." He also considered that we had been dealing with abnormal years. In 1899, there were Â£34,000,000 of imports. Does the right honorable and learned gentleman think that this Tariff is going to operate so quickly, that there will be much difference, considering the increase of population - and the increase of prosperity, I trust - within the next few years ? In 1897, the total trade of Australasia was Â£138,000,000; in 1898, it was Â£147,000,000. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going back 100 years. I am dealing with the situation as it presents itself to me in the year of grace 1901, and in regard only to Australia, for I am not going to England, America, or any other country to-night. But I want to point out this fact : When we take away the duty of about Â£4,500,000 on spirits and narcotics - that is, customs duties and excise - we have a series of duties tabulated here which bring in Â£4,285,000. Now, it might be thought by glancing casually at this document which has been circulated, showing the estimated revenue under each item - it might be thought, when we found that out of that Â£4,285,000 about Â£3,000,000 are entirely for the purpose of protecting the manufacturers, that we should have upon the page something devised for the protection of the producers of the country. It is very adroitly worded - "agricultural products and groceries," but let us examine the list. I should like honorable members to listen to this, because we are coming down now to the bedrock of the situation, so far as this Tariff concerns nine-tenths of the people of Australia. The duties upon agricultural products and groceries are estimated to produce Â£1,141,863, and of this amount Â£764,239 has practically nothing at all to do with the producers of the country. It has reference simply to articles like sago, tea, and things of that sort, which enter into the domestic concerns of every man in the country. When we take the balance of Â£377,000 - the balance that is supposed to protect the farmer - and when we add to that the duty on timber, because I want to put in everything that is possible, we have Â£496,000 or Â£500,000 which affects the industries of the great producers of the country. What is the summing up of it all ? We have a Tariff of Â£4,500,000, drafted to a large extent upon proper financial principles, and, with the exception of sugar, perhaps, purely for the bringing in of revenue, and for no other purpose. We have then got about Â£4,500,000, the balance of the Tariff, and will honorable members believe that out of that Â£4,500,000 balance of this Tariff only Â£500,000 affects the great producers of Australia ? I say this Tariff is a " bit of organised hypocrisy," as my honorable friend said of something else the other night. There is one very curious thing in connexion with it. We have got here a lot of articles which are supposed to yield duties, and which yield no duties at all. We asked for this return for a certain purpose, and we have to thank the Government for their good nature in giving it to us ; but from this return honorable members will find that eggs bring in Â£650 for the whole of Australia. Then we have an item like hay and chaff. There is a brilliant duty on hay and chaff, to protect the farmers of Victoria, but though the Cabinet went through these different items they could not find that there had been any imports of hay and chaff. The same thing applied to onions, and so on. </para>

                        <para>- Even if you allowed that, at a certain period of this protectionist mania you forced the men from other occupations into these particularly protected industries, then all you have to face is this, that you have done away with the importation. But we are not dealing with a protective system, or a Tariff of 30 years ago. We are dealing with the present condition of affairs in Australia, and even supposing that your protective system did it, which I deny, nearly the whole of these matters of your so-called protection we export. Even supposing that protection had hastened these operations, we have to deal with this Tariff now, and in looking at the people of the whole, of Australia we find that in nearly all the matters of natural produce we are an exporting country. I should like to know whether, in face of what I have said, the people of this country are going to enter upon a career in which you want to raise up a system of coddled manufactures, because this system will not merely retain the manufactures of Victoria, but the same process will create molly-coddled manufactories in other States. If you do this what do you think will be the great future of this continent ? What are we? Are we not a great food producing country ? Is it not a curse to us that, instead of your men going out and developing this great country which we hold in trust, by your system, you bind men more and more to the towns ? Is it not a fact that for some of the social iniquities which are now facing you you have created boards, which so far are futile - are you not by this very policy accentuating that evil, and making it a national thing for all time to come? </para>

                        <para>-They have come to our side more than to honorable members on the Ministerial side because the industrial people of Australia - even the industrial people of Victoria - are beginning to find out that the men who sit on this side of the House are those to whom they have to look for protection - not for protection under a Tariff, but for protection against the iniquitous system which it was never expected would be foisted on the people of Australia. I am perhaps speaking very strongly, but I do feel that we are in a false position in this House. There are honorable members here representing Victorian constituencies, like my very esteemed friend the honorable member for Gippsland, who admit that, while they are protectionists, they have been elected by free-trade constituencies. </para>

                        <para>- I am talking about his manifesto that was issued at the outset of the campaign. Furthermore, throughout the length and breadth of Australia men were elected to Parliament, not exactly on the fiscal issue in many instances, but because they had been public men, and on. the faith of the Prime Minister's manifesto at Maitland. Now, I leave that manifesto to any honest-minded man. I also leave the speeches of men like the Minister for Home Affairs and others who tried to explain away the erratic utterances of their colleagues in other parts. I remember as well as possible that, when there was an outcry against the erratic utterances of some of the extreme protectionists in the Ministry, both the Prime Minister and his colleagues tried to explain them away. The Prime Minister said, time after time - "I gave you my manifesto at Maitland, and I intend to stick to that with loyalty." I know there are many men in New South Wales who, although moderate protectionists, were elected on the understanding that this manifesto would be carried out to the letter. I felt myself at the time that the Prime Minister could be trusted, but I thought that in the first place we should have to form an Opposition in order to watch the Ministry, as I was afraid that when the Prime Minister got into this House under certain influences he would not be master of the situation. What is the result of all this ? That instead of expounding a policy that would be fair to the whole of Australia, a policy based upon their own statement, a policy under which we could cry a truce upon this fiscal question throughout the whole of Australia, a policy under which all men might unite together for the common good and for the carrying out of legislative measures for all Australia, the Government have placed before us a Tariff which honorable members on the Government side of the House, especially those representing Victorian constituencies, are gloating over as their own protectionist Tariff. I feel that instead of this Commonwealth being inaugurated under happy auspices - because, after all, this Tariff is the ground work of the finances and industries of the country - the people in all the Australian States are smarting under a sense of injustice. How else could it be? We have made the statement time after time that, even at the very best, the whole of those engaged in the manufacturing industries of Australia represent only a small percentage of the population, and how could we expect the great mass of the people to treat this Tariff except as an outrage upon democratic principles? I have heard a lot about the democracy of Victoria, and I have heard a lot about majority rule ; but I say that this Tariff is the result of an organized minority to tyrannize fiscally over the whole of Australia. This majority, which might have been used perhaps in a State House, as a majority in a unified country, ought not to have been considered in dealing with the Tariff, as it has been considered by the present administration. The Government ought to have looked around the whole of Australia. The Government ought to have looked at the original compact of the Constitution, by which we must consider the majority of the States, as well as the majority of people The Government ought not to have created a situation which might possibly bring about a constitutional struggle at the verv beginning of our Commonwealth. </para>

We have always heard a great deal of the number of Chinamen manufacturing furniture in Sydney. To-day the number does not exceed 500, and most of the men have no one dependent on them. There is considerably more furniture manufactured in Sydney to-day than there has ever been. </para>

                        <para>- The duty will do no harm to the manufacturers, but it will mean something to the working men of the country about whom the honorable gentleman talks so much. In conclusion, I should like to refer to one great industry in Australia ; that is the commercial industry, or the shipping or mercantile industry, or whatever we may call it, of which the honorable member for Melbourne is so brilliant a representative. Victoria has spent millions, I suppose, in creating a port, which is so finely represented by certain gentlemen here whose policy it is to close it up. We have a trade which must be derived to a large extent from exports from Australia ; and we cannot deal with such exports unless we foster the mercantile and shipping interests of the Commonwealth. We cannot do a trade over sea with our goods so as to place them cheaply in the markets of the world, unless we bring goods to Australia. I wonder if "\any of the honorable members who advocate extreme prohibitive protection, imagine that ships are coming here with empty bottoms. All I can say is that if they do, they ought to remember that ship-owners must pay their way. If produce is not brought here, freights will have to be increased, and an increase of freight vail often make the difference between profit or loss in the market of the world. This question of shipping lies at the root of the whole future of our industries. We all know that the question of price is not settled in Australia, but may be settled in New York and London, and if facilities are not given for sending our goods as cheaply as possible to all parts of the world, we are neglecting the great producing interests of Australia. We have heard a great deal about manufactures, but the two great sources of our wealth and of our employment are the producers in the country and the mercantile and shipping interests of our ports. The people of Victoria have to a large extent sought federation, in order that they may increase their geographical boundaries. Victoria will be drawing her supplies and her sources of wealth, not from the manufacturers of Melbourne, but from the great masses of the people working in Victoria, working in Riverina, and working in the mines of Broken Hill. Are we going to create a policy which will absolutely say to the world - " We want to shut off communication with you " " I say that is a most suicidal policy, and one which must ultimately break down ; because it will be so clear in the years to come that the interests of the few have been studied at the expense of the interests of the many, that although we may have to come to it through toilsome years, and although this agitation for free ports and free commerce may have to be kept up to the detriment of politics, yet the time must come when the destinies of Australia as a great food-producing country for the congested nations of the world must come into greater prominence day toy day. It will then be clear that, compared with the secondary interests which the Government are now bolstering up in this Tariff, those great interests on which the future destiny and progress of Australia depends must be made foremost in our economic and financial systems. If this Tariff is passed, instead of our getting to that state of affairs in the early period of the Commonwealth, we shall have to work through many years of fearful internecine strife in order to achieve our purposes. </para>

I confess that when I read that speech and another one delivered by the honorable member for Parkes, I came to the conclusion that they were taking up a very patriotic attitude. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate the speech of the honorable member for Wentworth was most unequivocal, and would convey to the minds of all who read it the fact that he had faced the position and recognised that there must be a concession upon the free-trade principles which he and his political friends had so long held, and that that was the sacrifice that was to be made for the accomplishment of federation. I think, then, that we might well ask the honorable member to point out more clearly than he did in his speech wherein he had been disappointed. He has given us the old arguments from the free-trade stand-point, but, as a matter of fact, he knew when he made the speech to which I have referred, that those arguments would have very little application indeed to the Tariff which this Government would have to introduce. All practical men recognise the fact that in uniting six States, five of which have had for years more or less protective policies, and one of which had to some extent a protective policy until 1896, and had only recently adopted freetrade, there must be a concession to the conditions existing in the five States on the part of the one which had adopted a different system of fiscalism. I was also rather taken aback by the very extraordinary calculation my honorable friend made, which showed to his entire satisfaction apparently that because 22 members were returned for Victoria on the protectionist side, therefore, Victoria was dominating the position and crushing New South Wales. As a matter of fact, when I asked the honorable member to explain the calculation, he said that that majority was ruling the position. How does it rule the position ? By the votes of the protectionist party throughout Australia, in addition to those returned for Victoria. The votes of the 22 members from Victoria would have no effect whatever, and would not be part of the majority, unless they had the support of the large representation from the other States. I may say that one thing that struck me about this Tariff immediately it was enunciated was- </para>

                        <para>- I was remarking, when I was interrupted, that one peculiar feature about the reception of this Tariff was that apparently the extreme free-traders on the one side and the extreme protectionists on the other were dissatisfied with it. I believe that that is the position to-day ; and it certainly goes a long way, to my mind, to prove that the Ministry have fairly attempted to carry out the policy which they said they would adopt, of having a Tariff which would be fair to the whole of Australia, and not an extreme proposal which would please either the one side or the other. We have heard to-night and on previous evenings a great deal about what the Prime Minister said. He has been accused by the last speaker, in very unmeasured terms, of having entirely departed from the obligation which he undertook in his speech at Maitland. I read that speech. I also heard the speech which the Prime Minister made in the Town-hall, Melbourne. I sat within a few yards of him on that occasion, and I can only say that when I read two or three extracts from that de-' liverance honorable members will agree with me that the Prime Minister, so far from having departed from the understanding with the country, is carrying it out, or endeavouring to carry it out, to the letter. He said - </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable the leader of the Opposition knows that well, because the duties which are causing all the commotion are revenue duties - those which are put on tea, coffee, kerosene, and other articles which are generally used. Those are the articles which the right honorable and learned member would have to tax if he were in power, and if he had to put what he calls a revenue Tariff before the country. Every man knows that that is the position. Every man who has thought of the matter for a moment is aware that,, whenever a Tariff is proposed which takes money out of the pockets of people who have not been accustomed for some time to pay it in that way, they are bound to make a noise about it. I do not think that we can feel indebted in the least degree to the right honorable the leader of the Opposition for his profession of anxiety to deal with this matter in a broader and better manner than the Government are doing. I listened patiently and quietly to his remarks, but I heard nothing whatever of a constructive character from him. He did not indicate what lines he would go upon that would be better than those propounded by the Ministry. He failed to do so for the very good reason to which I have alluded already, namely, that if he had said he would raise the required sum from the sources to which he would have to resort, he would have shown at once that Short was not the friend of the country, but that Codlin - the Government - was. </para>

                        <para>- Of course that is a matter of opinion. I shall not contradict the right honorable and learned member, but I agree with the Government that it is a necessity to raise this large amount of revenue, and not to do so by a Tariff such as that to which the leader of the Opposition has alluded. The only alternative scheme put before the House has been that suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney. Upon reading his speech carefully this morning, I found that, except for some slight changes which might be made - and some of his suggestions might very properly be accepted in committee - his scheme proceeds entirely upon the same lines as are followed by the Government. There is absolutely no essential difference in principle between the two proposals. The honorable member suggested a reduction of the duty on tea. He favours making it half the amount proposed by the Government. He advocates a reduction of the duty on kerosene, and the raising of the-excise duties upon tobacco and beer. But these are not matters of essential principle. They are rather matters for adjustment and modification, which can properly be considered in committee, but which do not really make any division between the parties upon either side of the House. We have been told that New South Wales will be the chief sufferer by this Tariff. I can scarcely conceive that those who make that statement mean what they say, because that State will suffer no more than will any of the other States. The fact is as we all know, that New South Wales has had a very low Tariff for some years. But having regard to its financial position, New South Wales has just as much need for the amount which will' be raised by the duties proposed as has any of the other States. That State annually derives a large revenue from the sale of Crown lands. This money which really represents capital, has been steadily absorbed during the last eighteen years at the rate of Â£1,200,000 a year. If the revenue thus obtained were devoted either to the redemption of the public indebtedness, as was suggested by the committee which sat and discussed the Public Accounts of New South Wales- </para>

                        <para>- Probably I could, although I have not such an exaggerated opinion of my own abilities as has the right honorable and learned member. I feel that I am justified in making these few remarks with regard to the position. I do not wish it to be understood for a moment that I regard this Tariff as being by any means perfect. There are certain very grave defects in it. If the leader of the Opposition had brought down a Tariff, I should very likely have been able to say the same of it. In the nature of the case, considering the circumstances under which this Tariff had to be framed, the unknown quantities with which those framing it had to deal, the new problems with which they had to grapple, and the fact that they had necessarily only the advice of their officers to fall back upon, it followed that many incongruities and mistakes must creep in. Now that we have the matter before the House, and the Government have the benefit of the information which they could not previously obtain, we shall be in a position to see that the inequities and mistakes of the Tariff are properly remedied. Honorable members opposite have said that this Tariff is the Victorian Tariff. I say it is not the Victorian Tariff. There are great reductions made on the Victorian Tariff, and in some cases made at both ends, if I may use the expression, because the rate of duty has been reduced and a duty has been put upon the raw material in many cases. That has led to serious mistakes which will have to be remedied in committee. But taking all the circumstances into account I believe it is a fair and honest attempt to carry out the obligations which the Prime Minister undertook in his speech at Maitland and in the Town Hall at Melbourne. As I have said, it will have my support, but I retain to myself the right which I believe other honorable members will claim for themselves, to give my opinions upon the various items of the Tariff as they come up. If we cannot pass a perfect measure we should at least endeavour to make this such a Tariff as we would like it to be. It must be remembered also that this Tariff is to some extent a tentative measure. We cannot expect it to be a permanent Tariff because as the first Tariff which brings all the States on to a common platform its various effects will not be at once perceptible. However, Parliament will have the power to amend it at any time in such directions as will make it answer the purposes for which it was introduced. At this late hour I do not intend to trespass further upon the time of the House, but I desire to say a few words with reference to the very extraordinary line of action taken by the right honorable the leader of the Opposition when making his speech in moving this vote of censure. One might have expected that a speech upon such a motion, dealing as it does, or ought to do, with the existence of a Government, would be above all paltry or personal motives ; but, to my surprise, I found the right honorable and learned gentleman breaking all the traditions of Parliament so 'far as I have been acquainted with Parliament. </para>

The right honorable gentleman brought my name into the discussion in a manner which I say was unwarrantable. I am a member of this House, elected by a constituency to whom I expressed my views, and by whom I was returned as representing them in the same way as the right honorable gentleman was returned by the constituency he represents. I submit that he had no right whatever, under any circumstances, to allude to private business or private matters in the way he did. </para>

                        <para>- Had the right honorable gentleman's insinuations been true, his references would still have been unjustifiable, and how infinitely less justifiable were they when, as I shall proceed to show, they were incorrect. The right honorable gentleman, ostentatiously said that he did not know anything of these matters himself, and he spoke upon the information of a certain gentleman whom he considered an authority. I submit that he has no right to come to this House with the gossip he may receive. He is essentially a pleader, and when he pleads in a law court he has a lawyer to make up his brief for him. It seems to me that whenever he goes on the stump, or comes to the House, he brings a brief to which he allows any one to contribute. Sometimes his brief is " made in Germany ; " at other times it is supplied by gentlemen whom he considers to be reliable authorities, but he is so keen a partisan that he never waits for one moment to consider whether his informant may be disinterested, whether he may be an expert, or whether, in adopting the information he gets in this casual manner, he is not contributing to a base form of business rivalry which causes gentlemen to give him information of a more or less reliable character in order to damage a business opponent. </para>

                        <para>- I must apologize, sir, for rising while you were on your feet. I was not aware that you were addressing the House. The first statement of the right honorable and learned member was in reference to my firm, and in connexion with the matter of rice. I am not going into the question in detail. When he talks of one man and two boys and a machine being fall that was necessary for this manufacture, it is out of place in Parliament, though it would be very good fun on a variety stage. He showed that he knew nothing of what he was talking about. He said that he gave that information on the authority of an expert, but it was a case, so far as the expert and he were concerned, of the blind leading the blind. He ought to know that it is a large manufacture. When he says - and it is characteristic of all his statements about them - that the Victorian industries are all shoddy industries, or unimportant industries, he shows his ignorance, and nothing more. He went on to say that there was a differential duty in the Tariff and he informed the House that my firm, and two others which he did not name - why did he not name them all, when he named my firm ? - were netting from this differential duty Â£10,000 a year. It is an absolute fabrication. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely without foundation. If the honorable and learned member or his informant had knowledge, as they profess to have, they would know that this is purely a compensatory duty in consequence of raw material being imported, which turns out a very much smaller quantity of the manufactured article. One hundred tons of rice imported in a raw condition and dressed here turns out about 80 tons, consequently about 20 tons is gone to waste, and that accounts for the difference. Without that compensatory duty it would be impossible to carry on the manufacture in this country. Certain remarks made by the honorable member for North Sydney, exactly cover the case : - </para>

                    <para>It had been said that a free-trader must put a duty on raw material as well as the partly or fully manufactured article. Nothing of the sort, that is not free-trade ; that is protection, and a worse sort of protection even to a free-trader because it is protection of the outside manufacturer. If the raw material is charged by weight, and the weight is larger than that of the manufactured article which is usually the case then to put the same duty on that material as on the manufactured article is a protection, but a protection to the outside manufacturer. </para>

                <para>These are the words of a man who understands what he speaks about, who does not come to the House and make statements without inquiry. In every case before he does make a statement, even though he gets information which may favour his view, he is at pains to see that it is true. In that respect his conduct stands out in a bright and shining way in comparison with that of the honorable member whom he follows. I have never been placed in such a position before as to have to discuss a private personal matter on the floor of the House. I ought not to be called upon to do so on this occasion, but I cannot allow the opportunity to pass, because the clear intention of the right honorable and learned member was to cast a stigma on me as a public man, and also to cast a stigma on the Government as favouring me because I am a member of the House. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman referred to a controversy, and I am stating the facts in order to lead up to what occurred in the House the other night. The right honorable gentleman made a statement then which I refuted- I showed clearly that, so far from the starch manufacturers of Victoria taking the highest amount they could under the Tariff duty, they were, owing to internal competition, selling the starch at an advance of onlyÂ¼d. per lb. out of the 2d. The right honorable gentleman entirely abandoned that line of argument, and why he brought up the subject again I cannot imagine, because he in his heart knows he was wrong, and that he made a statement he could not maintain. The right honorable gentleman, however, brings the matter up in another form, and makes a series of statements which I say are incorrect - incorrect - incorrect. </para>

                        <para>- I can only say that I took measures, after the controversy with the right honorable gentleman, to ascertain in London what the exact position was, and my information illustrates one of the difficulties in establishing industries in this country without protection. I have, through my correspondents in London, ascertained from Colman and Co. the price at which they supply shipments of starch for Australia, and simultaneously, through another London firm, I have ascertained the price at which the trade in London is supplied. The remarkable result is that, while the price free on board for shipment to Australia is 22s. per cwt., the price for use in London is 34s. per cwt., a difference of no less than 12s., or nearly 1Â¼d. per lb. According to the free-trade argument, the consumer's only safety and salvation against the rapacity of traders . and manus- I facturers is to have the competition of the wide world. And yet here we find one- of the largest firms in Great Britain charging 1Â¼d. per lb. more to the London trade than they charge to the shipping merchants who export to Australia. The argument of the free-trader is that the legitimate price is the competition price.. If that be sos how comes it that this commodity is- sent from England, and after paying freight, duty, and all other charges, is sold in Melbourne at 4s. or 5s. per cwt. below the price at which it is sold to the London grocers? Germany does the same thing; and the question is - how is it done ? The right honorable gentleman talks about free competition being the only means of protecting the consumer; and here we have the London price fixed by competition at lÂ¼d. per lb. less on the shipment. When we find gentlemen talking about 15 per cent, and 2.0 per cent, duty on an article on which the shipper can afford to give away 50 per cent., we see that it is of very little use to think of getting protection with such rates. In Victoria, under the protective system, an industry has been raised up which enables the trade to be supplied with starch at a price less, to the extent of 2s. or 3s. per cwt., than, that at which the grocers in London can buy. I have the price lists of a number of the leading houses in London, and I find that the Army and Navy Store charges 4Â½d. per lb.forColman's starch loose, and 5d. per 1-lb. box ; the Civil Service Stores supply at the same prices ; Herrod's, 5d. per lb ; the Civil Service Association, 4Â½d. per lb. ; Spiers and Pond', 4id.; and the new Civil Service Stores, 4Â½d. per lb. The right honorable gentleman told us last night that according to his circular starch was sold in London, for a less price than in Melbourne ; but from the latest price lists, which came out by" the last mail, we see that the article is sold to the consumer in London at a higher price than that at which the colonial product is sold in Melbourne. </para>

                        <para>- I do not care how many shops he has. The right honorable gentlemen added that a gentleman in Melbourne had told him that Colman's starch in 28-lb. boxes could be had in London at 3d. per lb., but I have Colman's private price list, which shows that the lowest price is3Â¼d. per lb.; so that it is absolutely impossible the right honorable gentleman's information can be correct.. This shows that honorable members, who talk freetrade, and who seek to lead Australia in a freetrade direction, have-absolutely no knowledge of what goes on in commerce. I tell the right honorable gentleman again, and I wish it to be reported throughout the length and breadth, of the land; that the London firm makes a difference of 50 per cent, between the shipping price and the price to the London consumer, with the result that firms under the system of protection are supplying grocers in Melbourne at 2s. per cwt. less than Col'man is supplying the London grocer. </para>

I cannot believe that, the right honorable gentleman was so innocent as he pretended to be. In his statement here he was most disingenuous. The right honorable gentleman concealed the fact - and has persistently concealed it - that the rise in the price of starch in Melbourne has been brought about by the countervailing duty on; the raw material for the production of starch, namely, rice. The new duty on rice is equivalent to something over1d. per lb. upon the starch produced in that way. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable and learned gentleman, is now raising a question which he did. not refer to on the previous occasion.. However, I. aim going to deal with that, because I am not at . all afraid of the honorable member. He is all, right on the Town-hall platform, where he cannot be answered, but I am thankful to have him here, where I can show his absolute incorrectness and unreliability as a public man. It is a peculiar thing that a comparatively small article, the consumption of which does not exceed 2 lbs. weight per annum per head of the population, should be made so much of in the light between free-trade and protection in Australia. It is the irony of fate - I think it is the absurdity of fate - that the right honorable gentleman should' pursue such a course as he has done at the instance of interested and designing parties outside, who have made him the medium for trying to injure those to whom they are opposed in business. I know the man who gave the right honorable and. learned member his information on this subject. When the right honorable and' learned gentleman, spoke, I knew by the language he used who had told him. I shall not name him all the same. </para>

                        <para>- No, it was not true; but it was one of those untruths that are the worst of all - which are half truths; and which tell only a little of the story. I think I have made it clear to honorable members that the position is very different from that which was stated by the right honorable gentleman. With regard to this additional' Id; per lb., let me make it clear again that the right honorable and learned member must have known that since the 10th of this month a duty has "been imposed upon rice which has added Id. per lb. to the cost of starch. The honorable member now raises a new question by stating that we have raised the price of the starch that we had in stock. All I can say is that any firm would have done that. </para>

                        <para>- I wish the right honorable gentleman were blue. Fortunately, I have nothing to do with blue, but I think that the conduct of the right honorable and learned gentleman is very blue, indeed. The next item that was referred to, and in regard to which the leader of the Opposition showed his unreliability, was that of preserved milk. The light honorable gentleman, used the name of my firm in connexion with that article. As a matter of fact, my firm does not make preserved' milk, but we happen to be the agents for a small company, with which I am connected as a shareholder. The attack which has been made in connexion with this item of preserved milk, is a malevolent one, and proceeds from interested parties, and it is very discreditable that the right honorable and learned gentleman should allow himself to be made the medium for delivering attacks which are instigated by ill-feeling on the part of some one in the city. The company to which I have referred is an extremely small one, which has done very little business, and all attempts to extend operations to the other States have been pretty well throttled.. The statement was made by the leader of the Opposition that this article was sold at 6s. in Melbourne, and 4s. 6d. in New South Wales. All I can say is that the whole export business done by the company does not amount to- more than 100 cases per month, and that the prices for the product outside of Victoria have been regulated by the rates charged by importers of European brands of a similar article. These prices have resulted in a heavy loss. It does not require much consideration to enable any one to realize that in introducing a new article it is very often necessary to accept a price which is not remunerative. </para>

                        <para>- The duty on preserved milk under this Tariff - although a great noise has been made in this House about it - will be lower in Victoria than under the State Tariff. The duty under the Victorian Tariff was 2d., under the Queensland Tariff 2d., under the South Australian Tariff Id., under the Tasmania Tariff 25 per cent., and under the Western Australian Tariff 15 per cent., whilst in Canada the duty is lÂ¾d. This matter is no concern of mine, and is of no great magnitude, but a large industry is springing up in the other States - in New South Wales and Queensland - and I would ask those honorable members who talk about the primary industries whether this is not a primary industry? Everything that is contained in the manufactured article comes from the soil, and is produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Sugar and milk- nothing else. As a matter of fact it seems to me that this discussion is being reduced to an absurdity. The attacks which have been made have been most unjustifiable, and I am perfectly conscious that whilst they will not injure me, they will recoil upon the heads of those who have made them. I hold in my hand the price-list of a leading firm producing condensed milk. It contains a list of places to which this firm ships, and I find that while the price is 18s. 6d. a case, they reduce it to 15s. when the article is exported to certain places. Then at the bottom of the list they inform the public of Australia that they will not enter into any proposals for the purchase of their commodity in London for shipment to South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland, or New South Wales. That is just like the case of the proprietors of the reapers and binders. Those who sent for reapers and binders could not buy them in America. They have been told that they must buy them in Australia through agents, and the purchasers here have been made to pay 125 per cent, profit. And so in the case of this condensed milk, it cannot be bought in London for export to certain Australian States, but is sent out here to agents, who are informed that wherever a local article is springing into Consumption - and it is a natural industry of this country - the price is to be kept down to a non-remunerative point. When free-trade agents claim that we manufacturers in this country are extorting money from the public, or as an honorable member opposite unfairly said, putting our hands into the pockets of the people of the Commonwealth, I say that it is high time that this line of argument were discontinued. As a matter of fact, these industries have great difficulties to contend with. In the first place, they have to meet the prejudice which always exists against any new thing. Then again, some of these articles are difficult to produce in this climate. Such is the case with preserved milk. Climatic conditions have to be overcome, and I maintain that if that industry is established in this country by the duty which the Government proposes, within five years the whole of the continent will be supplied with preserved milk of local manufacture, and that means from 250,000 to 300,000 cases a year. I further believe that we shall be in a position to export it as we do butter, and other commodities. I can remember the time when nearly all the butter which was consumed in Australia came from Cork, in Ireland. In Victoria we put on a duty of 2d. per lb., which led to the article being produced locally. Within a few years we were able to supply the whole State with butter, and to export the article, and the dut)r of 2d. still remains on the Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the right honorable member's allusions to me were certainly not justifiable, because they were not correct ; and, as I have said before, the imputations and insinuations were calculated to lead to incorrect conclusions in the public mind. I think that as a gentleman, it is the place of the right honorable member to withdraw them. However, that is a matter which lies with himself. </para>

                        <para>- As I pointed out at the time of the controversy with the leader of the Opposition, the Sydney price was to some extent shaped by the opposition we met with from the importers of English goods, who give off ljd. a lb. ; and we had, in order to introduce our goods, to reduce our price to a small extent - perhaps 2s. or 3s. per cwt - to meet that competition, and to get a chance of having the article introduced into that State. That, as I said in the newspaper controversy at the time, was perfectly reasonable. It is the only way in which any firm could carry on its business under the circumstances. But the inference which the honorable member seeks to draw, is that when a firm exercised the same right of dealing with its goods as English firms under free-trade did - neither more nor less - only using it to nothing like the extent that English firms do - because they were under a protective policy, they were doing wrong, whilst English firms were charging something like 50 per cent, less for shipments than for the locally sold article. I can only Ray that these matters are pure matters of business, and every one knows that. But what I object to was the insinuation made by the right honorable member that this was owing to improper action, and that, as a matter of fact, the protective duty was responsible, whilst in reality the protective duty had not been availed of to anything like the extent to which we might have availed ourselves of it. I will say this further - that the whole of this matter has caused me considerable annoyance, and if I have spoken more heatedly on the subject than I should prefer to do, it was because I feel deeply that a very serious wrong has been done to me. </para>

                    <para>I hope I may say, in moving the adjournment of the House, that most if not all of the arguments that can' advantageously be used on such a motion have been used in the course of this debate. What will happen hereafter, will be within the rights of honorable members, but must largely consist of the reiteration of the arguments already advanced. That being taken into consideration, without any desire in the slightest degree to dictate to the House, I may venture to express the hope that we shall come to a speedy termination of this debate. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether, in view of the difficulties that honorable members have in obtaining statistical information, he will make available to the House information which must be in the possession of the Ministry, showing the Inter-State trade and the over -sea trade in detail, in order that we may be able to see of what this Â£29,000,000 of trade consists- whether it consists entirely of the products and manufactures of the States, or whether, as it has been said frequently, a large portion of it consists of Inter-State trade in imported goods. Honorable members are not in the position of the Government. They have not had a staff of clerks to ascertain the whole of the figures for them, and if this debate has been somewhat prolonged, owing to the fact that we have not had all the information which should have been before us, that roust be our excuse. I would ask the Prime Minister whether the figures showing the Inter-State trade, and showing also not only the amount of duty obtained from each of these articles on the present Tariff in each State, but the quantities imported cannot be put before us. All these figures must be in the possession of the Government. If they cannot be given to the House before the conclusion of this debate, they should be available at any rate for the use of honorable members during the debate on the various items of the Tariff. They would be of great assistance to us. </para>
