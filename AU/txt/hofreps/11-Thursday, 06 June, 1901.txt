The practice which is now being followed is not the practice of the House of Assembly of the State of South Australia. I am quite aware that whore the passing of a Bill will require the appropriation of revenue, a message from the Crown must precede the action of the House in regard to that Bill ; but we are now asked to authorize an appropriation without knowing exactly what it is for. </para>

                        <para>- No. In New South Wales the message is referred to the committee on the Bill, and when, after the second reading has been passed, the House goes into committee for the consideration of the Bill in detail, the message is read, and nothing more is done with it. In Victoria, however, the practice is for a committee to come to a resolution upon the message, and to consider the Bill afterwards. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to again call the attention of the com- mittee to this practice. The resolution expressly says that an appropriation is to take place,, and whether it is afterwards referred to a Committeee of Supply or not, by carrying it we affirm the expediency of an appropriation, the amount of which and the purposes of which we are ignorant of. I do not think there is any obligation upon us, because Melbourne is our present habitation, to follow the procedure of the Victorian Parliament. The usual constitutional course is to have a measure requiring any appropriation of public money heralded by or afterwards supported by a message from the Crown j but if we pass this resolution, we shall have affirmed the expediency of expending money for purposes of which we are, at the present moment, absolutelygnorant. I I suggest that the South Australian practice be adopted. </para>

                    <para>. - It is a most natural thing for any honorable member coming from any part of the Commonwealth to wish to see the procedure of his State Parliament adopted here ; but if we adopt the procedure of the South Australian Legislature, we are confronted with the difficulty which arises out of the non-adoption of the procedure of five other State Legislatures. The practice of the Victorian Legislature has been adopted in this instance because it is the practice which has been formerly followed in this Chamber, and to which a large number of honorable members are accustomed ; and because it does not radically differ from the procedure of other State Legislatures. I must demur from the doctrine that because a procedure lias prevailed in South Australia it must necessarily prevail hero. The authority for this practice is laid down in section 56 of the Constitution which says : - </para>

                        <para>- That is quite true, and I am to a certain extent responsible for the provision being worded in that convenient manner. If I may mention it " with bated breath and whispering humbleness " before the honorable members for South Australia, the invariable practice of the New South Wales Parliament has been that the introduction of a message from the Crown shall precede the presentation of any measure ; and Bills have been thrown out there by the score because their presentation has not been preceded by the introduction of a message from the Crown. I ask honorable members if it is not the more proper and fitting coUrse to have messages introduced before the introduction of a Bill, even though it may be constitutionally right to bring down a message at the tail cud of om; dealings with any measure ? </para>

I am simply adopting this practice because it happens to be a convenient one, and for the additional reason that it seems to pay the most attention to the privileges of the House. </para>

                    <para>It appears to me that that raises a kind of discussion which may well be left until the Standing Orders Committee take up their work. Therefore, nothing more is needed than a reasonable time limit to the length of speeches. I propose to abandon the last part of that standing order, and to avoid at present any limitation of the length of the discussion. The next paragraph to which I will refer is No. 62. This concerns fees for arrest and commitment, and says that honorable members shall be fined ?5 for arrest and ?10 for commitment. I think we might do without that standing order at all for the present, especially as the tone and temper which the House has shown do not indicate that there will be any necessity for an appeal to such a drastic regulation. In the next place the Serjeant-at-Arms, if there happen to be an arrest, which I do not anticipate, is entitled to some remuneration for his care of the honorable member whose company may no doubt be very pleasant, but for whose keep it is necessary there should be payment. I have, however, reduced the charge from ?2 2s. to £1 1s. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure the honorable member will not run the least risk of having to pay. Standing Order 129 has reference to the superseding of questions ; but it was found, on revising the standing orders, that the ordinary unwritten practice was quite sufficient, and so 1 have omitted that standing order. Standing Order 211 is next, and deals with the method of printing, presenting, and certifying Bills that are passed ; and I have adopted a more convenient course by the striking out of certain words, lt is really a clerical alteration with the object of making the proceedings less formal and more prompt. Standing Order 217 deals with the appointment of the Chairman of Committees. Originally the standing order provided that the Chairman of Committee should hold office during the Parliament, and until he ceased to be a member. As the Standing Orders Committee will have the whole question of this appointment before them in framing the permanent standing orders, I considered it quite sufficient to make the first appointment - until the committee reported - an appointment for the session, and therefore I have altered the standing order ito read in this way - </para>

                            <para>- I certainly think there ought to be a certain number of members rising to support a motion for adjournment.

                            <para>- This standing order is adopted from a Victorian standing order which has been found most beneficial, because while motions for adjournment have been put under some limit, this " grievance day," as it is called, every third Thursday, has enabled members to raise any urgent question of which they have not been able to give notice. It has afforded a safety valve for honorable members of the House on one of the three Government nights, and experience in Victoria has shown that the privilege has not been abused. </para>

                            <para>- From that point of view I rather agree with the standing order, but I was not quite sure what the intention was, because in the State of New South Wales the practice is quite different. There we have had to rely solely on moving the adjournment of the House for the ventilation of grievances, until the transaction of financial business proper comes on. </para>

                            <para>- - I do not wish the standing order left out, but only wanted an explanation of how it was going to work. I take it that it is not intended to proceed with financial business only on the third Thursday, because it would probably lead to some confusion in the conduct of other business and in regard to Bills in hand if we proposed to abandon them every third Thursday,' leaving of course only two days in the week for pushing forward large measures of policy other than those of finance. I know of no objection to the course which is now proposed. It would be most unwise for us to adopt the standing orders of any one particular State in preference to the proposal which is now before honorable members. I have gone through the temporary standing orders very carefully, and I can see- especially with the alterations that are now proposed - nothing of vital importance to which, objection can be taken. At the same time I can see some things, which if they are allowed to remain in the standing orders will be discussed by the House, and probably rejected. There are two or three things to which objection may fairly be taken, but the committee may see the unwisdom of allowing them to remain in the standing orders, and wo may save time by passing them tentatively now. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to direct attention to Standing Order No. 38, which certainly contains a restriction of the rights hitherto enjoyed by members of the State Parliament of South Australia. It seems to me that the provision referred to deprives honorable members of a right which they should always possess. Why should I, if I feel strongly on a particular subject, have to ask the permission of any other honorable member to bring that matter under the notice of the House? The utterances of the Prime Minister lead one to suppose that in reducing the number of members who will be compelled to approve of a motion for an adjournment being moved, from 12 to 5, he looked upon the only question which could possibly arise as being a State question. </para>

Moreover, what may appear a grievance to one honorable member may not appear so to another.

                            <para>- I do not know what the Government have had to do in New South. Wales, but certainly two wrongs do not make a right. There ought not to be any provision in the standing orders which will prevent an honorable member from bringing forward any question upon which he may feel strongly, even if he has to go to the extent of moving the adjournment of the House. I protest against this clause, and I trust that the Standing Orders Committee will seriously consider whether there is any necessity for the restriction. </para>

I repeat that if these- standing orders were gone into in committee,, the great bulk of them would pass without, question. Many honorable members may make a keen study of the standing orders,, and may help discussion in the House, but they will not have an opportunity of doing so in the Standing Orders Committee. I ask. the- Prime Minister to put a time limit on. the operation of these temporary standingorders. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps we can amplify that care by one or two more suggestions. With regard to the 38th standing order, I do not know whether.it is advisable to mix up the two adjournments that may take place on motions. One is the adjournment of the House, and the other refers to a motion for adjournment when the hour of assembling ou the following day is varied. That is really an informal motion. "That the House at its rising adjourn until a certain hour," which is not the ordinary hour of meeting, is the usual form of motion upon which a discussion upon a matter of urgency takes. The adjournment of the House is moved in the form " That the House do now adjourn," but there is another motion which gives honorable members an opportunity for discussing a matter of urgency, and that is " That the House at its rising adjourn till a certain hour." Last Friday it was moved " That this House at its rising adjourn till 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday," but when the sessional order was passed yesterday the motion was in the form " That this House do now adjourn." The sessional order fixes the hour at which, without a motion varying it, the House will meet. If an honorable member wishes to move an informal motion he varies the hour at which the House ordinarily meets. </para>

                            <para>- Irrespective of the difference in practice, I say that the better practice, even from the point of view of conserving the privileges of the House, is to have different motions. Why should the standing orders not allow a private member to move the adjournment of the House ? Under Standing Order No. 38 the only person who can move the adjournment of the House is a Minister of State. That is a bid practice. It is not the practice in England, and it is not the general practice throughout the States. Why should any honorable member, feeling that Ministers have lost the control of Parliament, without the suspension of the standing orders, not be allowed to move the adjournment of the House ? It is sometimes a speedy method of execution that is really merciful to Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. We may confer a power on the Governor-General, but we may establish a practice to which he is obliged to bend. The Crown in England has the right to suggest amendments, but as a matter of practice it is not allowed to do so. The practice has been abrogated. As this is a matter that affects the privileges of the Houses, if the Prime Minister does not wish to deal with the question now, it can be considered by the Drafting Committee. But 1 suggest that it is possible to amend the standing orders so as to immediately deny the right to which I refer. </para>

                        <para>- It would be better to have a standing order providing how secret committees are to be appointed, and for what purposes. Then Standing Order 264 says that the name of His Majesty or of his Representative in the Commonwealth shall not be used " irreverently" in debate. I think that the term "disrespectfully" would be abetter one to employ. </para>

                            <para>- There was such a limitation in the standing orders as originally drafted. Those standing orders provided that no member except a member holding office should be permitted to move the increase of a tax in committee on a Bill ; but I am glad to see that that restriction has now been removed. But, under this drag-net provision to which I refer, we may be bound by the disability which binds members of the House of Commons. There is no Constitutional restriction upon honorable members in regard to the increasing of taxation, though there is a Constitutional restriction upon them in regard to the increasing of appropriation. I hope that our standing orders will not limit the rights and privileges of honorable members in regard to matters of taxation. When we go into Committee of Ways and Means on the Tariff, we should have a free hand to propose, not only the reduction of proposed duties, but also the substitution of other duties, and, if necessary, increases of duties. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is something in the contention of the honorable member for Macquarie. The usual practice is to record an honorable member's vote on the side on which he gave his voice. If he called for a division on the side of the ayes, his vote is recorded with the ayes, and if he called for a division on the side of the noes, his vote is recorded with the noes. In my opinion that is how the standing order should read. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that the measure is regarded as a treasure by some acquisitive persons as being the first measure presented to this House; I can find no other explanation of the accident which has occurred. The Bill, which involves no principle other than has been universally accepted, is a measure providing for the simplification of the language of Acts of Parliament, and the shortening of their terminology. It constitutes in a sense a legal dictionary, particular meanings being assigned by it to particular phrases, which must be used over and over again in almost every Act of Parliament. Instead of repeatedly defining these familiar phrases in every Act in which they occur, definitions of thom are gathered together in the sections of the measure which honorable members are now asked to consider, so that when these phrases are met with in other Acts, reference may conveniently be made to this Act for their definition. The measure is necessarily a compilation, and possesses scarcely an original feature. But it may assist honorable members to proceed with what will be essentially a committee discussion if I, for a moment or two, direct their attention to one or two provisions to which they may wish to devote special consideration. First of all, honorable members will find it provided in Clause 2 that - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, in a particular connexion, because then it applied to the whole Constitution, and the Home authorities naturally said that the introduction of such a phrase might seriously affect a measure so far reaching in its effects as that which established the Commonwealth of Australia, giving these States new powers in regard to external affairs which might involve relations with foreign countries. Of course the immediate aspect which occurred to them had reference to the proposed limitation of judicial authority in connexion with appeals to the Privy Council. In addition to that construction, the law officers of the Crown dwelt upon the fact that a measure such as the proposed Constitution touched the foreign and domestic interests of the Empire at so many points that it was hard to see how far the phrase might riot carry them. </para>

                        <para>- We have also the Canadian instance. Honorable members will see that the next group of clauses, 3 and 4, are taken directly from the English Act. Clauses 5 and 6 are purely formal. There is nothing calling for further notice until we come to clause 11, where we have taken advantage of some provisions which will be familiar to my honorable and learned friends from New South Wales. They are used in their interpretation of Acts in connexion with the expiration of enactments. The clause speaks for itself, and will probably prove to be useful. The subsequent clause relates to the interpretation of an enactment for continuing a temporary Act. These clauses, I understand, have been approved by professional opinion in New South Wales, and have been of some service in that State. Clause 14 is a provision which to some honorable members may appear superfluous, but is to be found in the Victorian Interpretation Act. It provides that the headings of the parts, divisions, and subdivisions into which any Act is divided shall be deemed to be part of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I should be happy to hear the honorable member on the point in committee. I call attention to 'clause 14. It is taken from the Victorian Act, while clauses 16 and IS are taken from the New South Wales Act. These clauses practically embody what we all know to be law already,- but they have been placed in this Interpretation Bill to put the matter beyond all question, so that any person who may read them may, without any knowledge of constitutional law, understand them. Then I come to what may be termed an original element in the Bill. I allude to clause 20. Here we are called upon to give a certain number of definitions of what must be very .familiar terms in all measures passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. They amount to little less than the application of familiar terms to federal conditions, and I pass them over as not calling for special notice at this stage. </para>

                        <para>- The reason the definition requires to be given is that the word "Australia" is a very convenient and short term to imply the whole territory of the Commonwealth. We adopt it because it has a well-understood meaning in the public as well as the legal mind. Passing over this definition clause as not calling for special notice, I direct the attention of honorable members to page 6. The definitions there relate to such judicial expressions as "The High Court," "The Federal Court," "Court of Federal Jurisdiction," "Court of Summary Jurisdiction," and as to what is meant by "Federal jurisdiction." That is defined to mean " Jurisdiction as to matters in respect whereof the High Court has or is capable of being invested with original jurisdiction." Honorable members will have in their minds two important sections of the Commonwealth Act, one of which endows the High Court under the Constitution itself with an original jurisdiction, while the other allows an extension of the original jurisdiction in certain defined directions. The words "Federal jurisdiction " here used are to be taken to embrace the whole of the original jurisdiction - either that conferred by the Commonwealth Act or that which may be conferred by subsequent enactment upon the High Court or Federal tribunals. The definition will be found very valuable in connexion with the measures which will shortly be laid before the House for the establishment of the judicial powers of the Commonwealth. Then there arc more English clauses until we come to pages 8 and 9, where honorable members will notice that a part of clause 35 and the two following clauses are taken from the New South Wales Act. Some honorable members may wish their attention drawn particularly to clause 38, in which we accept the English plan of measuring distances for the purpose of any Act. We say that the distance shall be measured in a straight line on a horizontal plane. This differs from the plan in force in New South Wales, and there is a good deal to bc said in favour of that as more convenient than the method proposed by the Bill It would certainly be a more convenient mode of measurement under Australian conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Still we think it better to apply to all Federal Acts, the English plan of measuring in a straight line. Finally, honorable members will see in clauses 41 and 42 provisions dealing with the citation of Acts 'of Parliament. We have adopted the plan of citation used in New South Wales, giving the secular year and the number of the Act passed in that year. This plan of citation appears to be more convenient than that adopted in Victoria, where we have adopted consecutive numbers for the Acts and the year of the reign in which they were passed, giving no other clue to the year in which they were passed. Honorable members will therefore see that this Bill is a stepping stone and a convenience intended to simplify legislation in the future, and to shorten its expression. These are two objects which need not be further commended to honorable members. I shall welcome criticism in detail when wo get into committee. It is needless to say that there is no possible party complexion in the proposal, and that all the assistance that honorable members can render in perfecting what ought to be a very useful if modest measure will be welcomed. </para>

                    <para>. - I think an alternative course can be adopted which will meet the convenience of honorable members equally well. There is no desire to rush the Bill through, though the Ministry wish to have it passed as soon as possible, because it enables an interpretation to be placed upon certain terms and provisions of various Acts which it is necessary to pass, and because until it is pissed there will be a doubt as to what interpretation ought to be placed upon those terms. I suggest that we should go into committee upon the Bill now, and that afterwards if honorable members opposite desire to have any clauses recommitted, that course should be taken. </para>

                    <para>- Speaking as a layman I should like to make a suggestion with regard to this measure. I have had a copy of the Bill for a week, but it was not sent to me. I picked it up. I have read it several times, and I see the immense importance of it. I think we might make some improvement in regard to the practice in connexion with the repeal of Bills. We might, for example, repeal the whole of a Bill when it was necessary to repeal only a portion of it, and then re-enact the portion which it was desired to retain. That would be better than having a number of amending Acts, which tend only to cause confusion. We could say that any Act to repeal part of an Act should repeal the part in question, but should, at the same time, re-enact the remaining portions of the Statute. We should then only have one Act upon the subject, and there would not be the complications which arise under the present practice. I merely throw this out as a suggestion for the consideration of the Attorney-General between now and the time when we shall finally deal with this Bill. If we adopted the suggestion, we should not have upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth the large number of amending Acts which we have upon the statute-books of the States. </para>

                    <para>- This Bill will undoubtedly be very useful. It seems to me to be very well drawn indeed, and I have great pleasure in complimenting the draftsman on its preparation. There are, however, several clauses in the Bill we ought not to adopt without deliberation, and with respect to which there may well be a considerable amount of discussion. I merely wish to draw attention to some of them at the present stage. Not that I desire to oppose the Bill. My sole object at this moment is to direct attention to clauses which are deserving of special consideration. Some of them go further than I think they ought to go in an Interpretation Act. This is intended, as I understand, to be an Interpretation Bill, and not a legislating Bill. It is not a measure altering the law or introducing new constitutional provisions, but is merely for the purpose of interpreting words and expressions. The Attorney - General has very properly drawn attention to clause 2, and lias referred to the expression, " shall bind the Crown." I do not wish to say at this stage that I am opposed to that provision, but it appears to me to be open to discussion. On turning over the pages of the Bill, it will be noticed that there is not a single clause in it that affects the Crown. There is not a single expression that' seems to be intended to regulate the powers of the Crown, or in any way to affect the Royal prerogatives. Consequently, I do not see that there is anything in the Bill on which this phrase "shall bind the Crown" can operate. If there is nothing in the Bill upon which the mandate "shall bind the Crown " will operate, I do not see the use of having it in the measure at all. There is no doubt that in certain Acts of Parliament there are provisions which are intended to bind the Crown. It is a well-recognised principle in the construction of Statutes, that in order to bind the Crown, the Crown must be expressly and clearly mentioned in terms. If, in the course of our legislation in this Parliament, it becomes necessary to introduce any provision to bind the Crown or affect the Royal prerogatives,, it will then be incumbent upon us to use expressions clear and unqualified, by which the Crown will be bound. The Crown will not be bound in an indirect way in an interpretation clause. If the Crown is intended to be bound, it must be bound in an Act which is passed affecting its rights, powers, privileges, and prerogatives. Consequently, without' wishing to go so far at the present stage as to, say that this clause is absolutely unnecessary, I would suggest that the Attorney-General consider the propriety of omitting it, because it may lead to complications and difficulties hereafter. It is difficult to perceive, at the present stage, how the clause is to be operative, and if it is not operative, I apprehend it is unnecessary to introduce a provision which is not really required, and the effect of which hereafter we do not know. I would like next to draw attention to clauses 17 and IS, which seem to contemplate the differences between what are known in parliamentary language as public Acts and private Acts. Clause 18 conveys the impression that the Parliament of the Commonwealth has constitutional power to pass what are known as private Acts of Parliament. With reference even to that, I would not like to say the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not the power to pass private Acts, but I draw attention to it as a moot point, and a point which may be raised hereafter, in the construction of the Constitution itself - whether the Federal Parliament has power to pass a private Act of Parliament. The point was disputed for a considerable time in Canada, and I am not quite certain whether it is settled now that the Dominion Parliament can pass private Acts. The power has been challenged, and it lias been said that the Parliament of the Dominion can pass only general laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada. So that, hereafter, the point may be raised as to whether the Federal Parliament has the power to do more than pass such general laws, and the Contention may exclude the right to grant private Acts to interested persons. As I have said, I do not wish to pronounce an ultimate opinion on the point, on which I have an open mind. I do not wish to suggest any contention to limit the powers of </para>

The term federal jurisdiction under the Constitution covers both the original and the appellate jurisdiction; but in this Bill there is a limitation to the original jurisdiction. The State courts can be invested with appellate jurisdiction, or it may be that they already have that jurisdiction, irrespective of any Act passed by the Federal Parliament. However, I would ask honorable members not to insert these words. The term "federal jurisdiction" must bear the construction given to it by the Constitution itself.

                    <para>- I did not hear the honor able member, but if it be as I understood, that the honorable member thinks that all Acts bind the Crown, by the Constitution, these words can do no harm. I recollect that when the Commonwealth Act was under consideration in England, those words. " bind the Crown " were deliberately omitted. I thought they were left out because the Imperial authorities did not like them, and considered them to be an interference with the Royal prerogatives. But looking at the nature of this Bill, and considering that it is a mere Interpretation Bill, I say that you may express in a few words what otherwise you would have to express in a dozen, and to that there should be no objection. If the words have the same meaning as applied to the Crown, as if applied to a subject, there is no objection to that. I am sure that the Crown has no wish to assume that words mean one thing from the point of view of the Crown rights, and another thing from the point of view of subjects rights. But if the honorable member feels strongly upon the clause, the proposal of the Attorney-General should be accepted, and it should be postponed. </para>

                    <para>- I see great danger in passing this clause hurriedly. Unless the Attorney-General can point to some provision whereby, if an Act purports to be printed by the Government Printer, it shall be taken as having been so printed, it might be very well held that the burden of proving that the Act was printed by the Government Printer lay upon the person seeking to avail himself of it. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me to be very necessary for great care to be taken by honorable members with regard to clauses of this kind. A Government, five of the members of which are lawyers, should know better than to hurry such provisions. There are some clauses in this Bill which should be omitted altogether, and others that cannot be allowed to pass as they stand. If I come to such a conclusion after a hasty examination of the Bill, what might honorable members think if they had an opportunity of carefully examining its provisions ? We are here to legislate, and not to rush Bills through. This Bill is simply creating work for the lawyers. </para>

                        <para>- It is my misfortune as well as that of my honorable and learned friend, the member for Werriwa, that he was not present when I pointed out the peculiar nature of this Bill, and that it was one in regard to which the assistance of the House was invited. On many of the clauses, very reasonable differences of opinion may be entertained as to whether we are going too far or not far enough. The Bill was circulated six days ago, but unfortunately some honorable members did not get their copies until this afternoon. We welcome the criticism of honorable members, and if any clause is seriously challenged it is to be postponed. There is no attempt to take an advantage of any one, except so far as advantage can be taken of the advice and knowledge of honorable members on the matters involved. </para>

I believe there has been a decision that the courts will take judicial notice of the Acts as printed. I do not think this clause embraces everything. It does not cover an Act coming into force under a proclamation. The Royal assent may be given to an Act on one day, and there may be another date upon which it will come into force. The latter date may be fixed by a proclamation. The clause should cover everything. There is at present a leakage in that respect. </para>

                    <para>- I have made a note of the point, and shall be pleased to give it consideration. Honorable members will notice that one case is that of an Act repealing the whole or part of a former enactment, and the other is simply the expiration of an enactment as, for instance, when an Act is passed for three years, or some fixed time. I see the honorable member's point. The drafting might have been more artistic if there had been another sub-section ; but we have accepted clauses which are time honoured and well known without endeavouring to transform or amalgamate them. </para>

                    <para>- I take the opportunity of drawing attention once more to the point I raised on the second reading in connexion with clauses 17 and 18, which draw a distinction between public and private Acts of Parliament. The Bill as it stands assumes that the Federal Parliament may pass what is known as a private Act. If the Federal Parliament can do so, all very well, but if it cannot, this clause will not in any way affect the powers of the Parliament. "When a private Bill is brought . in, the right to introduce it may be -constitutionally challenged, and then reference will be made to this clause as a decision on the part of this Parliament, perhaps an imprudent decision, that there can be such legislation. As I said before, it is still a moot point in Canada whether there can be private Bill legislation under the powers to legislate for the peace, order, and good government of the Dominion. </para>

In our Victorian legislation we have no. private Acts in a technical sense ; and I do. not see that there is any gain in having any other than public Acts. In Victoria, we have what are called private Acts, "but . they are proved in the same way as are public . Acts, and are called private Acts for convenience, in order to show that they relate to some limited subject. </para>

                        <para>- A Bill maybe introduced by private individuals, but once it is passed it always, in Victoria, becomes a public Act. In the other States, I believe, public and private Bills are distinguished, and although fees may be paid in Victoria for introducing a private Bill, once the measure is passed, I can state on good authority that it becomes a public Act. Clauses 17 and 18. appear to me to be very dangerous. Clause 18 says that nothing in a private Act " shall affect the rights of any person other than the persons named in such Act, or persons claiming by, through, or under them."' If we read that literally, it means that a private Act will not be binding on any person, unless his name is actually inserted in such Act. Of course, the Attorney-General will understand that I do .not wish to be critical about the drafting of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I see that, and I should very much like to understand how it has worked in New South Wales. It is only four years old there I find, so that that State has not had much experience of its operation. At all events, what I wish to put is this : If we call a private Act an Act which gives a syndicate or corporation power to lay down a tramway, and then, in some way or other, that tramway interferes with a householder's ease by making a noise and emitting smoke, on the assumption that the householder is not mentioned in the Act, is the tramway company liable to an action ? The answer according to this Bill would be, that no provision in any private Act shall affect the rights of any person other than persons named in such Act. </para>

Of course, in England, there is a very different provision. There a distinction in England arising from the county Palatine that does not arise here. </para>

                    <para>- I had made a note of a similar objection to that which has been advanced. We certainly cannot bring in the territory in which the seat of Government is established ; there will be a special management of it ; and we shall need a special Act of Parliament. We cannot possibly have anything different from the geographical areas of the States, because they constitute the Federation. The Constitution Act defines the territory for general federal jurisdiction as the geographical area of the various States, and if the honorable member for Corio will follow the definition as far as possible, I think he will secure what he wants. </para>

                    <para>- Of course the ideas conveyed by the word "territory" are well known and understood. In the abstract application, I take it that the sub-clause as it stands is accurate and could hardly be otherwise expressed. But, on the other hand, I admit that the word " territory" has been used in special senses in the Constitution, and it may be advisable to put it beyond all question as to whether any one of those senses was excluded. I am indebted to my honorable and learned colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, for a suggestion which I will take time to consider, and which would make the clause read - " Australia" shall mean the whole of the Commonwealth, and shall include all parts of the Common wealth. </para>

It cannot have any meaning. except that which the context of the judiciary sections of the Constitution Act give it. There cannot be any reference to federal jurisdiction, except to such federal jurisdiction as is meant by section 71 of the Constitution Act. Why then should we define a term which is already defined in the Constitution, and give it a limitation which may lead to confusion ? </para>

                    <para>- I will deal with the contention of the honorable member for South Australia first. I altogether differ from the opinion expressed by the honorable and learned member. The provisions of the Constitution Act are certainly beyond our power to amend, and we should not attempt to amend them ; but we are now passing a Bill, by virtue of the authority given to us under the Constitution Act, which, when it is passed, will be an Act of the Federal Parliament, and in it we can assign whatever meaning we like to any words we choose to employ, whether those words have or have not been used in the Constitution Act. Of course, as bearing upon the question of convenience and propriety, I recognise the force of the honorable member's objection. In reply to the honorable member for Bendigo, I would admit that any jurisdiction which is capable of being exercised by any Federal Court or with which the Federal Parliament has power to invest any court is, in colloquial phraseology, federal jurisdiction; and the words in the Constitution may be taken to be used in that wide sense. But they may be also used for the purpose of classification. The widest words used in the Constitution - and, if my memory serves me, they are the words employed in the Constitution of the United States - are " the judicial power of the Commonwealth." Those words appear to me to embrace the jurisdiction of all the Federal Courts, and to sum up in the widest possible way all phases, degrees, directions, and developments of its judicial authority. Under that term you have an original jurisdiction of the High Court which you may confer upon such Federal Courts or State Courts as you please, and you have also an appellate jurisdiction. It is true that, as a matter of appropriate terminology, you would be perfectly entitled to refer to appellate jurisdiction and to all matters within the exclusive power of the Federal Courts as being within the federal jurisdiction, yet the idea that underlies our use of the term is that the judicial power of the Commonwealth may, for the purpose of convenience, be divided into two parts, one to be referred to as the appellate jurisdiction, and the other as the federal jurisdiction. The term federal jurisdiction may be then taken to refer to the original power conferred upon or which may be conferred upon the High Court or any other Federal Court. The expression does not apply to the jurisdiction of the High Court itself ; it is a limitation to the matters which the High Court has, or which may be referred to it by way of original jurisdiction. I do not present this terminology to honorable members as the best that could be obtained, but it is convenient. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to draw attention to sub-clause4, which is taken from the New South Wales Act, section 30. I am quite sure we should not adopt this sub-clause, which practically enlarges the scope of every Act of Parliament. We may have an Act of Parliament making an appointment to an office; and if in addition such an Act is to confer the power to remove or suspend the officer appointed, the Act itself should say so. We should not make provision now, in this Bill, to enlarge the scope and effect of future legislation. Let the legislators of the future give the effect they contemplate to their own Acts of Parliament. This sub-clause is legislation, not interpretation, and that is an objection. The sub-clause practically invades the domain of legislation. </para>

                    <para>- I should like the Attorney-General, when the Bill comes up for reconsideration, to pay close attention to this clause. It is a very risky clause indeed. The word " may " is frequently used in connexion with Courts of Justice, and has frequently been decided upon by the Privy Council, the House of Lords, and by our own courts. It means that when conditions of jurisdiction are satisfied, in a number of instances the parties have a right to the action of the Courts of Justice. If the word "may" is always to be interpreted to mean that the courts may or may not give those rights, leaving the matter to the discretion of the courts, then a very considerable change will be introduced into our law. I do not think it will be a change for the better. The case I have in my mind is that of Julius and the Bishop of Oxford.

                    <para>- I should like to see this clause retained in the Bill. The honorable and learned member for Indi speaks as a lawyer who is in the habit of appearing before the Supreme Court Judges. This measure, however, will come before people who do not know the meaning of legal terms so well as do the Judges. If it is understood at the time legislation is introduced that the word " may" is only to mean an option and not a compulsion to the person, it is a wise provision, and ought to be retained. </para>

                    <para>- I think the contention of the honorable member for Bendigo is quite arguable ; but this clause is in the Queensland Interpretation Act; I think also in that of New South Wales, as well as that of a third State. The clause is included for the purpose of shortening language as well as for its interpretation. In the Queensland Act, which is sure to have been carefully drafted, it has been in existence for some years. The clause is to cover the provisions in various Acts that certain bodies shall have power to administer the oath. Instead of saying that in every Act, we say it once for all in this measure. I was fortified in my disposition to put the clause in the Bill by the fact that I find it in several Interpretation Acts of the States. </para>

The Commonwealth Act, being an English Act, required to be interpreted by the terms of the English Interpretation Act. This is the same definition as that given in the English Act. It is not the definition they have in New South Wales. Taking Australian circumstances into account, there is a great deal to be said for the New South Wales interpretation. </para>

                    <para>- I think the use of the word " such " is to meet a difficulty we have in local Victorian public holidays and bank holidays. The word is intended to refer to the place where the thing is to be, or may be, done. It is necessary to remove the possibility of such a construction as that if there is a public holiday any where in the Commonwealth the clause operates everywhere. The holiday has to be pinned down to the particular holiday and particular spot. </para>

If " a" were used instead of " such," the clause might be held to refer to one of the particular class of holidays instead of covering the whole. I I think it would be better to retain the word " such." </para>

                            <para>. - The honorable member for Bourke has expressed some surprise that the Government have not moved in this matter. But there are a great many matters in which the Government have not had time to move. Honorable members will quite recognise the way in which time lias been filled up by the electoral campaign, by the Royal celebrations, and various other circumstances, which have made it impossible for a human Minister to deal with the whole of the many subjects placed before him. I welcome the motion of the honorable member. Whether or not it be expedient to adopt a decimal system of coinage - and that I. take to be the principal portion of the motion - this is certainly a subject on which the Commonwealth in its early days should make inquiry. If I may express a persona] opinion without binding the other members of the Ministry, I should say I lean strongly towards a decimal metric system, not only for Australia, but for the whole of the Empire. I believe that if Australia follows Canada in the steps she has taken, it may be expected that added force will be given to tins movement. The separation of the system of the United Kingdom from that of the rest of the world imposes very strong disabilities upon business people in the conduct of their business with foreign countries. Wherever English bred men meet in other countries, men who have learned the metric system - which they can do in their school days without very great difficulty, whereas the adult Englishman in middle life might find some trouble in mastering it - the Englishman regards the problem as one which ought to be solved in favour of his own race. </para>

                            <para>- Canada practically adopts the United States system. In point of fact, I found over there that the currency was really paper money. People rather stared at one, when one produced a five-dollar piece or anything in the nature of metal money, because nearly all trading is done in paper. But I welcome the honorable member's motion for another reason, and that is because I think it is time that the question of coining copper and silver was inquired into. I am happy to say that I received a note from my honorable colleague, the Treasurer, to-day, from the contents of which I am able to say that he is in possession of information which shows the entire willingness of the Imperial Government that we should undertake at least silver coinage, if not both silver and copper coinage. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the select committee will have something to say about that. There is not only propriety in having this inquiry, but there is also a leaning on the part of the British Government to grant us what we ask, and if, on the report of the committee, we have something to ask, so much the better. I think, therefore, we may save time in discussion by at once assenting to the motion. </para>

                <para>In doing so I have to say with some regret that the difficulty of obtaining some complete accounts has made it impossible for the Treasurer to introduce his Supply Bill tomorrow. While my honorable colleague has obtained his order for Supply he, nevertheless, has not the entire materials for the Supply Bill. The effect will be this : That as the Supply Bill should have been passed by the 9th inst. in order to utilize the authority given by the Constitution from the beginning of the Constitution until a month after the meeting of Parliament, when the Supply Bill is passed it will have to account for three days from the 9th inst., or in other words up till next Tuesday. I am afraid we shall have to undertake that very serious responsibility on behalf of the Commonwealth. Under the circumstances I am quite sure honorable members will understand the position of the Government in the matter. We could have brought in the Supply Bill earlier, but not with the information which we believe to be due to the House. </para>
