            <para>- As I understand that the Government are anxious to close the debate as soon as may be convenient to honorable members, my remarks shall be as brief as possible. I have listened with great pleasure and interest to the excellent speeches which have been delivered by honorable members on both sides of the House, and I think that this body is to be congratulated upon the spirit in which those speeches were made. As this is the first debate of the first Parliament of Australia, I think every advantage should be taken by honorable members of this opportunity to express their views. The discussion must already have been of very great assistance to the Government, inasmuch as they must now have learned the opinions of representatives from all parts of Australia upon the various questions which are referred to in the Governor-General's speech, and this knowledge should be of very great assistance to them in framing the measures which they propose to put before us during the session. I have noticed, however, that comparatively few of the members who sit immediately behind the Government have addressed the House. We have had very few speeches from honorable members who were returned by the State of Victoria to advocate high protective duties. We have had speeches from members of the Opposition in favour of free-trade, and from a large number of honorable members who sit on the Government side of the House in favour of protection ; but, so far as my memory serves me, none of those honorable members who advocate protection have stated what measure of protection they actually desire. </para>

              <para>- I hope that honorable members will be satisfied with what they get, and that they will not get very much. It seems to me that the Government are in rather an awkward position in regard .to this very important question. To use an old phrase, they appear to be "between " the devil and the deep sea." Honorable members on the opposition side of the chamber urge the adoption of a free-trade policy, while honorable members who sit behind the Government are, we know, in favour of the imposition of high protective duties. If we are to take the speeches delivered by these honorable mern.bers during 'the elections as a guide to what they require, it seems to me that the Government must depend, to a very large extent, upon the assistance which they will get from honorable members sitting upon the cross benches who are in favour of moderate and reasonable duties, and of honorable members sitting on the opposition side of the chamber, who will vote for moderate protection rather than have a high Tariff. I wish to make my position in regard to the Tariff question as plain as possible. I am in favour of the imposition of moderate and reasonable duties, and I think that the Government should carry into effect the language used in the Governor-General's speech, making revenue the first consideration. If we can, in providing for revenue, give our industries fair and reasonable protection, we should by all means do so ; but when I consider the composition of the Ministry, and remember that all its members, except one, are pronounced protectionists, I begin to have doubts as to whether the expressions contained in the speech are. really genuine, and I feel inclined to say, like the patriarch of old - </para>

              <para>- I hope that events will prove that I am mistaken, and that the Government will stand by the language used in the speech. If they do, I am sure that they will receive the hearty support of the majority of honorable members in this Chamber. Honorable members who are in favour of high protective duties must surely by this time have seen from the expressions of opinion by various speakers that a policy of high protection for the Commonwealth is utterly impossible, and that nothing but a policy of moderate protection will satisfy a Chamber composed of honorable members of the opinions which are held by the majority here. </para>

              <para>- I shall define it in a minute or two. It is a most astonishing thing that nearly every honorable member on this side of the House is now a moderate protectionist. If we had judged by the lion-like expressions in favour of high protective duties which were launched forth by a large number of those honorable members on their various electioneering, platforms, we should have been led to understand that nothing but a policy of the very highest protection would satisfy them. But I suppose it is because the conviction has been forced upon them that a high protective policy is now impossible, that they are lying on their oars, as the saying is, and recognise that it is not wise to be rash at this juncture, that it is not wise to say too much, and that they had better wait to see how the proverbial cat is going to jump. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad to hear that, and I hope that the Government will stick to their guns. If they do they will have my hearty support. I wish to define my position most particularly and exactly, and to lay it down, as I said on every election platform throughout the length and breadth of my constituency, that I am in favour of moderate duties - duties as low as we can possibly impose, in order to obtain our revenue ; but I desire these duties, as far as possible, to he protective, and the highest duty to which I would consent on .any single article coming into the Commonwealth would be 25 per cent. </para>

              <para>- A large number of honorable members apparently have been led away by the idea that we can have a uniform duty of about 15 per cent. I have studied the question very carefully, and I do not see how we can have it. In the first place, we require a revenue, I understand, of about £8,500,000. How are we going to obtain it ? It is acknowledged on all sides that we cannot touch direct taxation in any form. .'Direct taxation, as we know it, belongs to the States, and to the States only. Any new income tax or any new land taxation would necessarily have to be altogether different from the direct taxation obtaining in the States ; it would have to be extra taxation. Therefore, the Government have necessarily to fall back on the Customs for their revenue. If we are to believe our statisticians, our imports from foreign sources in 1899 were, as nearly as possible, £33,000,000. Of that amount between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000 came u rider the head of spirits, narcotics, and tobacco. </para>

              <para>- I referred just now to all the imports which come from foreign sources only, and I stated that the imports which came in from those sources amounted to £33,000,000, or thereabouts. I have nothing to do with the imports, and we have nothing to do with the imports which come from the various States and 'are not dutiable. Therefore we discard that altogether, and we take the actual amount of imports from foreign sources a,t £33,000,000 The whole amount which comes in under the heads of wines, spirits, tobacco, cigars, and narcotics is between £2,500,000 and £3,000,000. The amount of duty that was collected on those imports was £3,118,.000. AVe know that we have that revenue certain. That leaves us £30,000,000, less the amount of the free list, on which to calculate our duties. When we take off one-third, it leaves us £20,000,000 of imports on which to pay duties . which will give us the revenue we require in addition to the excise. If we have an average duty of 20 per cent., it will give us £4,000,000. Add that to the £3,118 000 on the imports of wines, spirits, and narcotics, and we have £7,000,000, leaving about £1,500,000 to be collected by excise duties in the various States on the manufacture of wines, spirits, tobacco and cigars, and on the manufacture of sugar. It seems to me these duties will have to be raised somewhat in that ratio. </para>

              <para>- In my opinion, if our industries cannot maintain themselves on the protection I have named, then the sooner they die a natural death the better. I have never been in favour of high protective duties. I have always considered that the high protective duties which have existed in Victoria, especially during the last few years, have been far more to our detriment than to our gain. If we go back thirty or thirty-five years - to the time when Victoria first adopted protection - no doubt some of the honorable members here will remember that the great arguments which were used in favour of protection in those days were as follow : - First it was claimed that as our mines were failing, a protective Tariff would cause industries to spring up around us, which would afford a large amount of employment to the miners, to their sons, and to their daughters, at highly remunerative rates, the result being that Victoria would go ahead by leaps and bounds, that her manufacturers would necessarily prosper, and that she would become the great manufacturing centre of Australia, and the most attractive colony of the group. We must admit that, after the inauguration of that policy, a large number of important manufacturing industries did spring up around us in various parts of the State, and that they did afford a very large amount of employment to our sons and daughters, and that the wages which were paid in those days were good. And it really looked as if protection was going to do for Victoria everything that had been promised. In fact, protection in those days became very popular, and I remember the time when we used to point with a finger to our important industries, and say, "Look at what protection has done for Victoria." But a change came about in this way. </para>

              <para>- In every industry, more or less. It was felt that the higher duties were not giving the advantages for which we had hoped. I, myself, in those days, believed that the higher duties would benefit us to a large extent. I believed that our manufactures would prosper to a greater extent than they had done, but, owing to our high protective policy, more manufacturers entered into the various industries than the demand warranted. The result was that there was an over supply in the market, and prices came down. I have learned the lesson that high protective duties, such as we have known in the past, can never make our country great, for the simple reason that we never can develop an export trade with the goods produced in our protected industries. If we impose high protective duties against goods coming in from the various great centres of America, Europe, and England, we cannot export the same commodities to the markets of the world, and compete successfully against the countries from which we claim protection. We never can develop any great export trade in the particular goods which require protective duties. The result is that while moderate protection may be good in itself to keep on their feet those industries which it is necessary to maintain, still it never can make us great manufacturers, and can never make us a great nation. We are on an entirely different footing in regard to protection from America, Germany, and the great European countries, where there are large populations, simply because they have a greater number of people for whom to cater, and there is an unlimited demand for their productions. They can manufacture in greater quantities for export to markets which are close at home, and in regard to which there is no great cost in the way of freight. We are in a different position. The only markets we can hope to capture are those close to us, and there we should have to compete against the very articles for which we require protection. Therefore, I cannot see how protection is going to help us to any great extent beyond seeming us our home market, and that must necessarily be limited. What we require is to develop our great natural resources. We wish to see help given in regard to the exportation of the great natural products of the farm, the orchard, and the grazing paddock. Our producers need to be assisted to put those articles in the very best possible condition on the home market. They need the cheapest possible freight to enable them to compete in the markets of the world. Those are the directions in what a paternal Government can help us in the future, and in that way more good will be done than by " endeavouring to foist a highly protective policy upon the country. I intended to speak on other subjects mentioned in the Governor-General's speech, but I do not desire to take up much more time at present. I hope to speak on the defence question on another occasion; but, before I close, I will say a word as to the transcontinental railway. Personally, from the information I have been able to gather, and from that furnished by honorable members of this House, I am strongly in favour of that line. I should like to see it constructed, provided it is warranted. Before the House is able to decide that question, the Government must authorize a complete examination of the country to be traversed. </para>

            <para>- Like the honorable member for" Brisbane I exceedingly regret that Queensland was not represented at the various Conventions which were practically the means of bringing about our sitting here to-day, but my regret is for totally different reasons from those advanced by that honorable member. The honorable member for Brisbane said the reason he was sorry Queensland was not represented at those Conventions was because the black labour question and that of the sugar industry could have been dealt with by the delegates sent there. While to a degree I recognise that it would have been wise for the question to be thus dealt with, I at the same time would like to have seen Queensland represented, for another reason - namely, that the State at the time would probably have sent to the Convention ten labour delegates, who would have assisted the democratic delegates to make the Federal Constitution more democratic, if possible, than it is. That is my reason for desiring that Queensland had been represented at the various Conventions. I think it well the position of Queensland should be placed before the House, and the reason shown why that State was not represented at the various Conventions. It will be remembered that at the Premiers' Conference it was agreed that the delegates to the Convention should be elected by the votes of the people. The understanding was, I believe, arrived at among the Premiers, with the exception of the Premier of Western Australia, now the member for Swan in this House. However that may be, there was one State in which the compact then made was broken ; because the Premier of Queensland desired that, while any man in Queensland - at that time they numbered somewhere about 80,000 - whose name was on the rolls, could be nominated as a delegate, the electoral college for the delegates should be the Legislative Assembly. We maintained that that was unjust and wrong, and that it was breaking the compact entered into by the various Premiers ; and with the aid of the democratic portion of the Queensland Assembly, we were enabled to prevent the Government from carrying out. their plan on that occasion. It was a well-known fact that the Government could not then have carried any seat for the Convention, and that was the reason Queensland was not represented in the body which drafted the Constitution. I. merely make this statement so that honorable members, who are probably not acquainted with the politics of Queensland, may know exactly the position that State was placed in so far as the Convention was concerned. I should not have spoken in this debate, had it not been that one or two Queensland members from the tenor of their speeches, seem to have desired to leave the impression - or, at all events, left that impression on my mind - that they were speaking for the whole of that State. There was a time when some of those gentlemen could probably get up and talk on behalf of Queensland, because they usually got their politics from the Government of the day, and naturally thought that they were speaking on behalf of the whole of the people of Queensland. There is another section in Queensland who generally think that Queen-street is Brisbane, and that Brisbane is Queensland ; but this view is totally wrong. Those honorable members - I refer to the honorable member for Oxley and the honorable member for Brisbane - were elected to this Parliament only after a very hard struggle, and I notice that in their platform speeches throughout the campaign, they were very careful to keep the question of black labour in the background, never bringing it forward prominently. </para>

              <para>- And further, in spite of what is said by the member for Brisbane to the effect that the black labour cry was merely got up by the Opposition to catch votes, I can say that nothing of the kind was the case. The cry originated with the press which supported the two honorable members who have spoken in favour of black labour, and it was through the press that the labour question became prominent, so that we could not have made it so at the last election. We have had some most extraordinary statements. One honorable member has told us that there are 22,500 white men dependent on the industry. I have repeatedly asked where this information was obtained. I find, on looking through the statistics of Queensland in connexion with agriculture, that there are somewhere about 3,660 white persons employed in the 69 sugar mills throughout the State. I want to know where the honorable member got the 22,500 white workers who are dependent on the few kanakas employed. The member for </para>

I merely make" this statement to show that the various assertions made from time to time to the effect that there is such a large number dependent on the number of kanakas employed are not in accordance with the facts. Again, the honorable member made a statement which I take as a direct insult to the white workers of Queensland. The honorable member distinctly stated that the reason kanakas were employed was not because kanakas could be obtained more cheaply, but simply because they were more reliable - that if the white man were employed in the various occupations in which kanakas are employed the white man would go on strike and leave his employer in a hole, and would be able to obtain higher wages through taking that mean advantage. I take it as a deliberate insult to the working classes of Queensland. I say it is absolutely untrue, and that there is no foundation whatever for such a statement. </para>

              <para>- Just so. On that point it appears to me that there is good ground to consider whether it is necessary to perform this particular work, which the advocates of black labour say the white man cannot do, although I do not for a moment admit that the white man cannot do it. I believe there are occupations in the northern portions of Queensland in which white men are employed where far heavier work is imposed on them, not only in regard to heat, but in regard also to the laborious nature of the work. Take the sinking of a winze in a mine. I have seen men go down into places where they could not remain for more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time. The only air they could possibly get was, of course, that given to them by artificial means. Yet those men do their work effectually and well. We do not hear any talk about their being unable to do it, or any complaint that they are unreliable. I say that white men are just as able to perform any sort of work in the cane-fields as are black men or kanakas. Of course, we are told that if an immediate stop be put to the importation of kanakas the sugar industry in Queensland is ruined. A good deal of this feeling has grown up through the planters themselves. They have used every effort to discourage the employment of white men in the sugar-fields of Queensland. They have tried to create the impression that tropical agriculture should be looked upon as degrading, and as fit only for black men. This is why many white men have looked upon it as an occupation in which they should not seek employment, and it is this fact, together with the low rate of wages paid to white men who seek the work that has produced the present state of things. We hear men say sometimes - "It is of no use my going to the plantations because they pay such small wages, and expect me to live under the same conditions as does the kanaka or coloured labourer who is employed there." Having these ideas, white men strongly object to seeking employment amongst the sugar plantations, and the sugar planters themselves are therefore to blame for not having sufficient white labour with which to carry on the industry in different parts of Queensland. As far back as 1883 legislation was enacted to prevent the introduction of the kanaka into Queensland after the year 1892. During that nine years nothing was done by the planters themselves to provide for the employment of labour other than coloured labour, and thus when the time came for the introduction of coloured labour to cease, it was found that the planters had not the necessary labour available to carry on the industry, and that there was nothing but ruin staring them in the face. Already we find that, owing to a large number of the sugar planters in Queensland being in the hands of the financial institutions, some of those institutions have been trying to bring pressure to bear upon the farmers by refusing to advance money, and when the farmers ask the reason they are told the present Federal Government is going to stop the introduction of kanakas, the result being that the industry will be ruined. The financial institutions, together with the planters, have created the impression that in the north, centre, and south of Queensland the stoppage of the importation of kanakas is going to have the result of ruining the industry. </para>

              <para>- The conditions, I admit, within the last year have somewhat improved, but at the present time there are 47 or 48 per 1,000 of the kanakas dying, and that has given rise to the saying that the planters of Queensland are practically manuring their soil with the carcasses of kanakas. If we take into consideration the enormous death rate amongst these people, I think there are grounds for making the statement. When these people are brought to Queensland their lives are anything but what they should be, and in spite of the statement of the honorable member for Brisbane, that they are harmless, docile creatures, I wish to draw attention to some of the outrages that have been committed in Queensland from time to time. There is no need to go over the long list, but we know that outrages have taken place, and that in Bundaberg and Mackay a woman is hardly safe in leaving her home after dark owing to the presence of liberated kanakas. Under those circumstances I do not think they are at all a desirable people to introduce. A very large number of murders have been committed in Queensland, and although it has been generally supposed that the kanakas have had something to do with them, it has been impossible to sheet home the crimes. I do not wish to place the whole of them to the credit of the kanakas, but they are generally attributed to them. I think, apart altogether from the sugar industry, that the traffic in kanakas is an inhuman traffic, and the sooner it is stopped the better in the interests of Australia generally. " It has been said by one speaker that the fact that the Queensland Government have not passed an enactment prohibiting the traffic is a reason why this Parliament should permit the employment of kanakas in the sugar-field, but it is a well-known fact that the Parliament of Queensland to-day is elected on the plural vote, and the first time the people had an opportunity of saying whether the kanaka should remain in Queensland or not, they, by an overwhelming majority, decided that they did not want the kanaka brought into the State. On that occasion the only two seats out of the nine the Government secured, were the seats held by the two honorable members for Oxley and Brisbane. Under such circumstances, I think this House has an emphatic decision from the people of Queensland in. regard to the employment of kanakas in the cane-fields. I do not intend to take up a very great deal of the time of the House, because I understand there are quite a large number of honorable members who desire to speak. However, there is one matter I would like to mention in connexion with the black labour question, and it is this. There has been a general impression that there should be a Commission of Inquiry into the industry. I do not think there should be any such commission. I think the decision of the people of Queensland at the last election was the best decision we could possibly have, and I am pleased to learn that the Government themselves are not favorable to the idea of a commission. I think it was the leader of the Government in another place whom I heard say distinctly, that as far as the Government were concerned, they did not intend to have a Royal commission of Inquiry into the black labour question. I was very pleased to hear the statement, because there is an effort being made at the present. time through the Chamber of Commerce and other bodies to bring pressure on the Government to appoint a commission. Let me remind the Government that they have already had a very strong opinion expressed by the people of Queensland. I do not think any Government could earn the respect of the people of the State more certainly than by stopping the traffic in connexion with islanders from the Pacific. As there is a desire to get this debate finished, it is not my intention to say much more. I have been exceedingly pleased to hear the speeches from both sides of the House during the few days that it has proceeded. I certainly think they were good speeches and were worth listening to,more especially the speeches, if I am not going too far in saying it, of the honorable member for Parkes and the honorable member for Bendigo. They were two fine speeches, worthy of the gentlemen who made them, and certainly worth listening to. What struck me most has been that all through the debate the question discussed has been purely one question of free-trade and protection. The whole debate has developed into a controversy between New South Wales and Victoria. South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland have not been in it ; they have hardly been mentioned. I believe Western Australia was mentioned in connexion with some transcontinental railway, which I understand has already been promised to the people of that State. </para>

              <para>- I hope the Right Honorable the Prime Minister will not think for one moment that I imagined the Government had made such a promise. I certainly thought, however, from the tone of the speech made by the Minister of Defence the other evening, that that right honorable gentleman made a very distinct promise. When the matter comes up, I trust that the fullest possible inquiry will be made ; and that the House will view the question purely on its merits ; if it then appears desirable to construct the line I hope the House will have the courage to sanction it. During the whole of this debate, the question of free-trade and protection has been practically the only one which has been discussed. To my humble mind, however, there are other matters which are just as important to the workers of the Commonwealth. I do not believe that this question of freetrade or protection is going to affect the great mass of the workers of Australia to any great extent. We have been told on both sides of the House that we must gauge our prosperity by the amount of wealth we produce. If I may be permitted to do so, I should like to enter my emphatic protest against such a doctrine. We must judge the prosperity of the people by their happiness and contentment, and not by the question whether they have produced more goods this year than they did last year. That is a more just way of judging the prosperity of a people. A fact which has struck me as most peculiar is that while both sides of the House have been trying to show us what New South Wales is exporting, and what Victoria is exporting - and while we find that we are exporting wool, meat, hides, and other things which are necessaries of life - thousands of people in different parts of the Commonwealth are actually in want of these particular commodities. We find many people desirous of obtaining those commodities, but having no means to get them. Yet we are told we must consider ourselves prosperous, because we are enabled to export that which should be used by our own people. I think there are many matters which could be dealt with by the Government with benefit to the workers. We see in proposals of taxation - whether they are from a free-trade source or from a protectionist source - that about80 per cent. of the taxation falls on the working classes, and that only 20 per cent. is borne by the wealthy classes. I certainly think that a better and more equitable adjustment of taxation than that could take place. We always find, however, that whenever there is any question affecting the wealthy classes, free-traders and protectionists do not divide themselves at all. They are prepared to vote together to fight against what they call their common enemy - the working classes. </para>

              <para>- Have we not in Queensland seen the free-traders and protectionists combining and saying distinctly in their manifesto to the electors that they had only one object, and that that was to prevent the labour party from getting into the Federal Parliament. That is a well-known fact in Queensland politics, and I think the same thing has occurred throughout the whole of the Australian States without exception. Where the capitalistic portion of the community is concerned, both parties are always prepared to go hand in hand to fight against what they call their common enemy - the Working classes. </para>

              <para>- I see no difference between a revenue Tariff and freetrade. If honorable members spoke of a revenue-cum-protection Tariff I could understand their position. A revenue Tariff is the same as a free-trade Tariff. If honorable members insist that free-trade means a policy under which no customs duties are levied, I say that no country has ever had free-trade, though I believe that the Hanseatic towns of North Germany once had it. When we speak of free-trade England, we do not mean that England levies no customs duties at all. A freetrade Tariff is a Tariff for revenue purposes only - it does not matter whether the amount of revenue obtained is small, or so great an amount as £8,500,000. Unfortunately, at the present time there are in existence industries which are said to have been built up under protection, and I believe that some industries have been so built up ; and the question arises - what is to be clone with them ? If I were the head of the Government, and had a good majority at my back, I would remove all duties upon imported articles where I found that the local manufacture of those articles was a thriving industry, and that the locally-manufactured goods were being sold in other States of Australia besides that in which they were manufactured. I would in this way gradually remove all protective duties, except so far as revenue duties might incidentally be protective, and bring into existence a purely revenue Tariff. That, I hope, is a clear definition of the policy I favour. Honorable members may ask why it is that I am a free-trader. In reply to that question I am almost afraid to quote authorities, because they have been spoken of with such contempt by some honorable members. The honorable member for Echuca seemed to think that education in political economy is of no value at all, and that no professor of that science could hold a sound opinion upon fiscal matters. It is strange that, while in regard to other sciences the educated man is regarded as somewhat of an expert when he gives an opinion upon a question which he has studied, the student of political economy should be looked upon as one whose views are outside the range of practical life. "Let us go to the practical man ; do not let us go to the man who wears a black coat," said the honorable member for Echuca. That seems a strange thing to say. On all sides we hear a cry for more education ; but when educated men tell us that protection is wrong, and free-trade right - and I hold that the majority of educated men who write on the subject do tell is that - we are told that their conclusions cannot be accepted. </para>

              <para>- If a professor of political economy were sought for, either in the Melbourne or the Sydney University, not a man of any distinction would be found, capable of filling the position, who would be prepared to tell his students that free-trade was wrong and protection right. It is true that there are a few who have written in favour of protection ; but honorable members opposite have not had the courage to give us their names. The other side has not had the courage to name them. It began, I believe, with Hamilton at the end of last century, and was continued by Carey and a few others. </para>

              <para>- Gladstone does not say in England only. He is speaking of protection in. general terms, and he says that it is a fraud. Professor Pearson, one of the most radical politicians Ave have ever had in Australia, said that to his mind freetrade amounted to the truism that two and two made four. When I find authority, supposing that my reason does not lead me in that direction, thus teaching me, surely I have a right to ask for an authority from the other side. They have not got one. I do not want to go into statistics. It has been alleged by a, good many of what I would call croaking Cassandras, that Great Britain is decaying, that her trade is falling away from her. It may be, probably is the case, that in a good many of her industries she has been cut out by other countries. But I think that a country that has paid off a debt of £125,000,000 in 25 years, whose revenue increased in that period from £75,500,000 to £129,000,000, that has built a splendid navy, kept up a most costly army, and locally spent money largely, can hardly be said to be a country that is falling into decay. </para>

              <para>- I am only answering a statement that was made from the other side. I did not intend to refer to statistics at all, hut I found that a certain statement as to figures had been made from the other side. I do not think that in a general discussion of this kind one can, by quoting statistics, arrive at any fair conclusion. That, I hope, will show why I feel it incumbent upon me to sit on this side of the House. There is one other question on which I differ from Ministers, and from some honorable members also on this side of the House, and that is the question of adult suffrage. I do not believe in womanhood suffrage, and when the time comes to speak I hope to give reasons which, though not satisfying to the House generally, will, at all events, be sufficient justification for the faith that is in me. In all other questions I shall wait for details, but I think I am at one with the Government. With regard to a white Australia, my reading and my converse with men has taught me long ago that it is not good for any community that there should be large bodies of whites and large bodies of blacks. That has been proved to be the case in the United States of America. It has been proved to be the case, I believe, in South Africa. I do not believe it is good for even our white race in India, small though the number of white people may be there.- I believe it is not good for the dark race or the white race. Therefore, I shall give my hearty support to the proposition to eventually get rid of both Asiatics - if that can be done with the consent of the "Imperial Government - and kanaka labour. We must do our best to see that Australia remains as a possession for the white man, and the white man only. On other questions, such as railways and so on, I shall wait for further information. I can assure the Government that I shall give no fractious opposition to their proposals. -I have mentioned the only two questions on which I differ from them - all important ones to my mind. As to what is a proper fiscal policy for the country, I want free-trade started from the commencement. My objection to protection is not so much on economic grounds. It rests on far more important grounds than that. I think that the social and political evils that. arise from people having to depend so directly on the action of the Legislature for their means of living is bad both for the people and the Legislature. There is a pas- </para>

          <quote>
            <para>To these economical difficulties in the operation of protection we ought to add the social and political results of placing industry in such direct dependence on legislation. Where the imposition of a duty may make the fortune of a producer or owner of some natural resource, and its withdrawal mean lowered profit or rent, the employer becomes perforce involved in "politics," in the vulgar sense. The English corn laws, the French protective systems, and the various American Tariffs have all been in part the outcome of the exertions of interested parties. Such relations are evil both for industrial and political life, and have a disastrous tendency to demoralize those concerned. It is not well that a measure so vital as the conduct of industry should depend on political contingencies, nor that the work of legislation should be mixed up with questions of. commercial loss or gain. </para>

            <para>- I desire, in the first place, to congratulate those with whom I have laboured in the cause of union upon the successful consummation of our efforts. I trust this Parliament will be a model to others that will follow us. I. deplore the fact that we have had introduced into this debate the old arguments with which we have been familiar in the States, setting one State against the other. Being a member from New South Wales, some remarks are called for on my part in answer to many things which have been said in this debate. It is not my duty to sit here and hear statements from honorable members opposite, many of whom are colleagues from my own State, which will not bear the interpretation put upon them. I trust that the same good humour which has been evinced throughout this debate will be continued during the present Parliament, and that we shall be able to discuss measures from time to time without any indulgence in personalities or any conduct tending to cause ill-feeling or ill-will. I should like first to address myself to the fact that during the recent campaign and during the last few years of my parliamentary life in New South Wales I have been sitting in opposition to a party who call themselves free-traders. Now there are no free-traders, in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. </para>

              <para>- There are absolutely none. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat is not a free-trader ; he calls himself a revenue tariffist. Many authorities have been quoted from time to time in the course of this debate, and now I am going to quote from one of the greatest free-traders of whom I know. He is the only writer I have read who has clearly pointed out what that class of politicians are who call themselves revenue tariffists, and what justification there can be for a revenue Tariff. I am going to quote a writer whom no one will deny is a genuine free-trader, Henry George. This is what he says : - </para>

              <para>- The Braddon clause has been termed "The Blot." Never by me, however ; I do not consider it is a blot. As one who has always adopted the principles of protection, believing them to be for the good of the many, and who has felt that we can only give that protection which is needed through the Customs houses of the country, I am of opinion that the Braddon clause, so called, does insure for a time at least that the revenue raised through the Commonwealth Parliament shall be obtained by means of the Customs house. That is a guarantee at least that the industries and the welfare of the people will be studied under the clause. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member will pardon me for taking a different view of this matter from himself. At least this guarantee has been given so far as the Braddon clause is concerned, and although other means for raising revenue may be adopted, the policy of the States will demand that the necessary amount of revenue shall be raised through the Customs houses of the Commonwealth. Therefore there is a guarantee to that effect. I would like to reply to some statements made by the honorable member for Wannon in regard to pauperism in England and other places. We have two bases laid down for us to follow here ; one is the prosperity of England, and the other the prosperity of New South Wales. We have been told times without number that there is more wealth and a greater distribution of wealth, with more home comforts and less trouble and disaster, amongst the workers in England than in any other place. I will take the countries of England, France, Germany, and Russia, and compare them, in order to find how this statement works out ; and my authority is Mulhall, in his latest edition, of 1896. According to this authority the paupers in England number 810,000-- </para>

              <para>- The answer is very easily given. England is a small area, less in territory than the constituency I have the honour of representing in New South Wales, and with a population of teeming millions, it is natural there must be an overflow somewhere. Rut where do the people go from England ? Do not the greater number of them go to the greatest protectionist country in the world - America % I am as loyal to 'that State of New South Wales as is any member sitting on the other side; and I have no desire to decry her interests or to deal with her in any other but a friendly way. Duty demands, however, that I should speak the truth here, and I have no hesitation in saying that in comparison with other States, New South Wales has far more unemployed, and far more of those who might be termed paupers, than has any other State in the Commonwealth. Not that I glory in that fact - no one would glory in it - but any one who 'has studied history, and has had to take part in the making of history as I have in the adjoining State, cannot but come to ' the conclusion that, in consequence of her legislation, there must be a dearth of employment in New South Wales, magnificent as is her territory. So chronic is this condition in that State that there is, what I believe exists in no other State, a permanent labour bureau, with a number of officers permanently situated there to find something for the workers to do. If these men are to be employed, they should be employed on useful; practical work ; but my colleagues in New South Wales know that tunes without number the loan funds of the country have had to be resorted to to find temporary work in order to keep these men from starving. Surely that is not an example we want to hold up to members of the Commonwealth Parliament as one for Australia to follow. We want to provide by legitimate, honest legislation an industrial life in the Commonwealth that will, of itself, provide employment for the worker. We do not want relief works ; we do not want the class of work I have described. I would like to deal - and only here will I do so - with the question of closer settlement and agriculture, in reply to statements made by the honorable member for Lang and others, and lay before honorable members certain matters for their consideration. The honorable member for Lang, in speaking the other night, said that Victoria's closer settlement was brought about by natural conditions ; but I happen to know that Victoria's closer settlement was not brought about by local conditions, but by legislative conditions, and by the keen interest the people of Victoria have taken at all times in placing people on the soil. By a wise system of land legislation - by not only placing the farmer on the land, birt by seeing that the farmer's industry was protected when he was there - did Victoria rise to that prominent position in which she now stands in regard to agriculture as compared with the other States. </para>

              <para>- I took the honorable member's words down at the time he uttered them, and he said railways were of no advantage to New South Wales in consequence of the largeness of the territory, and the remoteness of the places to be served. Now, let me deal with the comparisons which have been made between the two States of New South Wales and Victoria, and 1 wish to follow them as shortly as possible. Let me say that, in my opinion, any such comparisons are very unfair. In the first place, New South Wales is the mother State, and is twice the age of Victoria. </para>

              <para>- Tes, from my own knowledge I do know, and I think that the honorable member knows as well as I do. I know that there are rings in New South Wales not only amongst the millers, but amongst the importers, and very strong rings they are. What I desire is, to be one of that little band which is to break down these rings, but if we are to have rings or trusts at all, let us give the benefits to the people - to the many - and not to the importers, who are the few. To deny that there will be rings or trusts would be folly, but there is far greater danger, and the rings are more numerous in a State where there is no protection than in a State where there is protection. It is a very easy matter at all times for two or three importers to agree to form a ring or trust and to fix prices, as they have done in many instances that I could cite. But it is very much more difficult for 40 or 50 manufacturers to form a ring. </para>

              <para>- Will the honorable member tell me how it is - if there are no rings in New South Wales - that whilst the reaper and binder can be purchased in America for £20 as a maximum price, and the freight is only a little over £4, that particular article cannot be bought in New South Wales for less than £55? On this point, I happen to know that in my. own electorate, in order to break down this ring, seventeen farmers determined to put the profit represented between the cost of the article in America and its cost to them in Australia in their own pockets. Therefore, they said - "We will go outside of the New South Wales ring, we will send to America and get the articles out for ourselves." They sent their order to America, and received a reply that the articles could be got only through various agents in New South Wales. The agents have themselves formed a ring. </para>

              <para>- I say the importer is the greatest monopolist of whom I have had experience. There is no question about that. In internal manufacture or production the raw material is here ; we know what the cost is ; we know what the cost of labour and production is ; and when the article is put on the market, if it is not put on at a fair price, we know somebody is putting a large profit into his pocket. My honorable friend is a member of the association to which I refer, and knows exactly what is paid for the articles. As I look round the palatial dwellings of those engaged in the business in the city of Sydney, I am led to the conclusion that the profit is not a small one. </para>

Now, a great deal has been said also about the advantages that New South Wales has at the present time over the State of Victoria, and if the legislators of the State of New South Wales goes on year after year in the same direction it has taken in the past, apparently those advantages will remain ; but when they are taken away, and when we go into the matter closely, we will find that the people of New South Wales have now nearly arrived at that position, or, if not, they shortly will, when they will demand at the hands of Ministers a different principle altogether in the legislation of that State. t New South Wales, as has been said by some honorable members, has been living on her capital. Victoria has never been in that position. </para>

              <para>- I think there is no doubt that the honorable member is in no more hurry than is any one else to get to the federal, capital, which, we are told, is to be established in snow country. During the ten years previous to 1899, the territorial revenue of Victoria was £4,000,000 odd, and of New South Wales £19,00.0,000 ; that is, New South Wales had to expend £15,000,000 which she did not put into a sinking fund or into a fund for the reduction of her loans. Her loan expenditure during the same period was £20,000,000, against £14,000,000 in Victoria. </para>

              <para>- I know, perhaps, as well as the honorable member that previous to 1893 Victoria was just as great a sinner in this respect sis New South Wales ; but when the boom burst here, and it was demanded at the hands of legislators that severe retrenchment should take place, the pruning knife was put in, and borrowing was practically stopped, and has been stopped ever since. Victoria has ever since been living within her means and on her own resources. She has attained her present position by the activity and industry of her own people. </para>

              <para>- The greater portion of the male population who have left Victoria during that period have gone into New South Wales, and the portion of New South Wales they have gone to is the Riverina district, which belongs commercially to Victoria. That territory has been developed by Victoria, although it is a portion of the State of New South Wales. And why should the Victorian people not go to one of the sister States ? Are they not all Englishmen, or the descendants of Englishmen? Is it a crime to go from one State to another ? I hope that healthy spirit of rivalry between the States will always prevail, but where ever the people go I hope their emigration will not be reckoned against the State from which they have come. Why did our fathers leave England and come here? If that argument were to prevail at all times many of us would not be here. Our ancestors would be in England, treading on one another's toes, instead of enjoying freedom in a God-given land such as this. When Victoria wanted more room, what more natural than that her sons should go to some other part of the Commonwealth of Australia. But what is her position in that respect ? To every square mile of her territory she has thirteen persons, whereas New South Whales has only four. When the State of New South Wales, which is four times- the size of Victoria, can get into that position, there may be less justification for challenging its policy. </para>

              <para>- I could keep up a very grand position if I had a number of friends who would lend me the necessary money, and would be willing to trust to posterity for its repayment ; and it is a very easy thing for a community to do the same. New South Wales has lived upon that principle so long that, on the 30th of June of last year, her indebtedness was- £65,332,903, and her total debt is now nearly £70,000,000. The public debt of Victoria, however, is only £49,324,885, or £42 4s. 6d. per inhabitant, as against £48 per inhabitant in New South Wales. Victoria is called upon to pay an annual interest charge of only £1 12s. 3d. a head as against £1 18s. 6d. a head in New South Wales, her total interest charge being £1,887,355, as against £1,369,392 which is the total annual interest charge of New South Wales. New South Wales has built up her prosperity by the expenditure of loan moneys until she has now to raise nearly £2,250,000 a year from, her people in order to pay the interest. </para>

              <para>- In my parliamentary career of sixteen years, the-only member of a Government who ever approached the question with a determination to see justice done to the territory was the honorable gentleman sitting at the table - the Minister for Internal Affairs, who was always a Minister in a protectionist Government. When the chair he vacated was filled, can I forget what his successor did ? There are honorable members here who cannot forget that when tenders were called in the press of Melbourne, as well as other places, for the construction of a bridge at Gundagai, and a gentleman named McKenzie sent in the lowest tender, after complying with all the conditions, it was refused. </para>

            <para>- I am very pleased to have an opportunity of expressing my views upon the questions set out in the speech presented to Parliament by the Governor-General. At the very outset, I wish to emphasize a matter that appeals to me very strongly as a man coming from the class who are the bone and sinew of the land. We are at the beginning of things so far as legislation is concerned. Hitherto the people have had the greatest difficulty in understanding the laws they were supposed to obey. I trust that the Government will see to it that the laws they introduce to this House, and that are to be imposed upon the Commonwealth, will be set out in such language that the ordinary people may understand them. </para>

              <para>- Hitherto, in drafting legislation, the language used has been of such a technical character that even legal men have been unable to understand it. How is it possible, when men educated in the technicalities of legal language are unable to understand it, for the common people who are supposed to obey the laws to understand them? I trust the Government will see that the new laws they propose will be framed in language that will be sufficiently clear and explicit, so that he who runs may read, and not be couched in terms of such a highly technical character that the Judges of the Federal Supreme Court will not be able to understand them. It has been said - I do not know to what extent it may be true - that parliamentary draftsmen are something like poets, " born, not made." If that be true, I hope that the head of the Government will discover a born parliamentary draftsman to frame the legislation of federated Australia. Whether he be born or made, I hope he will so perform his work that the people of Australia may be able to comprehend the laws which Parliament makes. </para>

              <para>- In the electorate which I have the honour to represent, through the bungling, or worse, of one of the Government officers, no less than 200 voters were disfranchised. In another electorate, through the fault of an officer in not returning the proper papers to the revision court, some 60 names were left off the roll. Then, again, in an electorate some 60 men applied to be enrolled, and their names should have been submitted to the revision court. These men did everything they were required to do under the legislation, but when the rolls came to be made up it was found that while some who applied subsequently were enrolled, the names of those 60 men had been omitted. In other places it was discovered that electors who were on the State rolls found no place on the federal rolls. These are matters of administration rather than of legislation, but they show a deficiency the Federal Government would do well to look into and remedy as speedily as possible. In other States there is the same difficulty and the same trouble; and I suppose that in no State of the Commonwealth at the present time can it be truthfully said the whole of the electors, or the whole of the men entitled to take part in the constitution of the first Federal Parliament, had an opportunity of voting. Such an important occasion would naturally call up the patriotism of every man, and yet in each State largo numbers of electors were disfranchised or disqualified through the faultiness of legislation or of administration in . some respect or other. Then, in some of the States, the women's vote is allowed, whilst in others there is only one man one vote, and in very many there is not even one man one vote. The federal franchise should be based on the recognition of the principle of not merely one man one vote, but one adult one vote. I am not like the gentleman who spoke a little prior to myself this evening, and who intimated that he was opposed to giving the franchise to women. I am prepared 'to extend the franchise to women, and I say we cannot get uniformity in our federal elections until we are prepared to grant the extension. Some of the States have secured recognition of the female franchise, and their experience of it is, or, .at least, it has been shown in practice, that they are not going to abrogate the principle for the sake of uniformity ;'so that uniformity can only be obtained by bringing all the States up to the level of- recognising the principle of one adult one vote in the federal franchise. We should strive, as far. as the Constitution will permit, to. aim at making every vote in the Commonwealth of equal value, so that every Australian may have equal weight in making the laws of the Commonwealth. I know there are constitutional difficulties in the way of this consummation so far as the whole of the Federation is concerned, but we .must- aim, within' the Constitution, at making every ' vote of equal value in- -a particular State. There is at present ari absence of uniformity in this -respect. Some of the State Parliaments split up their respective States into electorates for the return of members to the House of Representatives, but in other cases the whole of -.the State constituted one electorate for that purpose. These are only a few of the instances that can be quoted in support of my contention that our first Federal Parliament has been constituted under a form such as no other Parliament has been constituted under. There have been so many differences and varieties of procedure and so forth. It seems to me that we should aim - now that we have the matter in our own hands - at getting a federal franchise that will enable the people of Australia to constitute the National Parliament upon uniform lines. I have indicated what I consider those lines should be, and I certainly think they must embody the principle of one adult one vote. </para>

              <para>- The State should not be put in the position of being a beggar or dependant on the Federal Treasurer. I admit it cannot now be helped, but I think that the States in the interests of good, sound, financial government will "have to come to our assistance in this matter. However, I am prepared to take the Constitution as I find, it, and endeavour to make it as workable as I. think possible ; but in order to attain that ideal I do not hold that J should be asked to make it a primary condition of taxation that I should provide for State as well as for Federal expenditure. I want to see the Federal expenditure made the primary consideration, and cut down as low as possible in accordance with sound and healthy government. </para>

              <para>- I am not so foolish as to say that protection was responsible for it. It was due to the fact that the millers having secured a market from exporters, also formed their rings, got us within their clutches, and kept us there. What is more is that whilst we had to sell our wheat for ls. per bushel that year, and were glad to get that for it, yet when we came to buy seed wheat we had to pay 7s. a bushel for it. We have learned that protection does not assist the farmers. We assist ourselves by forming co-operative companies to burst up rings. It is that, and not protection, which assists us. It seems to me that protection, instead of bursting up the rings my friend talked so much about, is just the one tiling that the rings fight for. Our honorable friend opposite was talking about machinery for farmers. He led us to understand that because of free-trade what we could buy in America for £20 or £25, we had to pay £50 for in Sydney. The honorable member led us to understand that was because of the ring formed in Sydney, and inferentially because of free-trade. Let me say this, that the ring is not a Sydney ring,' but an American ring, a ring formed in protected America, and the agency in Sydney which dares to sell a machine under the £50 fixed by the ring is cut off the list, and is supplied with no further machinery. We did not create this ring in free-trade New South Wales. It is the growth of America, and one of the natural growths of protection. I have had catalogues sent to me, in which I have been shown that certain articles that are-sold in America at a certain rate could be landed to order in New South Wales at half that price. In other words, I have been offered the right to purchase the article at half the rate which is being asked of American farmers, according to the catalogues of the company. Protection, it is claimed, makes a country wealthy, and brings about progress and prosperity. I have been looking for a country that has had progress and prosperity as the result of protection, but I have not yet found it If any honorable member can show me where such a place can be found, I am prepared to take a pilgrimage to it for the purpose of getting enlightenment. I was told in New South Wales to look at Victoria, where I would find factories with smoking chimneys, and that it was because we had not got protection in Sydney that we do not possess the same tiling. I have come to Victoria, but am not at all convinced. If anything, Victoria is behind New South Wales. I have been looking at statistics, because I thought it was just worth while to have a look at them, and see where some of my honorable friends have been getting their information from, and whether their statements are borne out by facts. </para>

              <para>- If protection is to do anything for a country, it must find increased opportunities of employment for the population of its big cities, and I understand it to be the contention of the advocates of the policy that it has that effect. But the fact remains that while the population of the capital of New South Wales, where natural conditions have been allowed to undergo their natural development, increased by over 100,000 in ten years, the population of the capital of Victoria, notwithstanding the artificial assistance given to the development of its resources, increased by only 3,000, and the population of the capital of South Australia increased by 28,000. </para>

          <para>But .Englishmen may take some comfort from the above comparisons, which serve to show the enormous bulk of trade which still fulls to the inhabitants of the United Kingdom. It will be seen that the United Kingdom imports per head of her population more than the United States, France, and Germany together, and that she exports of her own produce mid manufactures nearly as much per head as the people of France and Germany taken together, or as the people of the United States and Germany taken together. It may also be noted that, whereas England depends on the United States for 32 per cent, of her trade, the United States does 57 per cent of her total trade with the United Kingdom. </para>
          <para>New Zealand to trade with each other, why is it not equally good for the people . of the mother country and the people of the race from which we have sprung? I know there are those who say - "We agree in sentiment with that, but what we want to provide against is the competition with pauper labour and foreign labour." Let honorable members look up their statistics and they will find that the trade which the people of Australia do with foreign powers is infinitesimal. The bulk of our trade is done with the people of our own race, and I believe in making that trade free, and in opening up the natural opportunities of our country ; and we cannot open up those opportunities and make them available unless we have free intercourse and freedom of commerce and trade. It is in that way that we shall build up a nation here which we can very well be proud of, and which the race from which we have sprung may well be proud of. I am very pleased to have had this opportunity of addressing these sentiments to the House, and whilst there is much more that can be said on the matters set forth in the opening speech, I am not so hide-bound to any party as not to recognise good measures when I see them. If the Government bring down good measures I shall judge those measures on their merits, and assist them to put their Bills on the statute-book as loyally as I would assist any other men in the House to do so. But, when I see measures or matters of administration which do not commend themselves to me as being in the best interests of the people of Australia, they shall receive my opposition, I care not from which side of the House they may come. Whilst there are many matters in an address like this which invite attention, still some consideration must be had for my brother members. I will not, therefore, inflict myself further upon . their time and attention, but will simply express my thanks to them for the very patient way in which I have been listened to. </para>

            <para>- I do not propose at this stage of the debate to take up very much time, nor indeed would the condition of my health allow me, even if I wished to do so. Some remarks . fell from the honorable member for Deniliquin in connexion with revenue tariffists and protectionists. I stood before the electors of Illawarra as a revenue tariffist, and I held that a revenue Tariff meant this - that we thought that all the money coming from the Customs of the country should go into the public Treasury, be treated as public money, and be spent for the benefit of the people, whereas those who advocated the system of protection advocated that the whole of that money should go not into the Treasury, but should filter into the pockets of private individuals. I and the party to which I belong strongly objected to any part of the money coming from the Customs of the country going into the pockets of private individuals to enable them to become rich at the expense of the great masses of the community. </para>

              <para>- I think it has always been recognised as the result of protective duties that the bulk of the money, at any rate, goes into the pockets of private individuals. There is one matter to which I wish to refer, and which recent events have brought prominently before the people of Australia, and that is the question of the quarantine regulations. During the last few days we have had a state of affairs happening in Sydney Melbourne, and other ports of Australia which has brought this matter very prominently before us. Luckily for the people of Australia, we have a strong and determined man in the position of Minister for Internal Affairs. I trust, that the Government will, as Soon as practicable, take over the quarantine departments in the whole of the States, so that we can have one uniform system in the Federation. It has been pointed out by those in charge of the quarantine station in Sydney that if certain ships - had been properly inspected at the various ports they visited, this serious outbreak in Sydney and Melbourne would not have occurred. Nor, indeed, is this the only occasion on which a similar </para>

              <para>- I repeat that it was the necessitous condition of Victoria at that time which brought about the establishment of the dairying industry here, and I am glad to admit that it has increased by leaps and bounds, and has far outstripped the dairying industry of New South Wales. But how can protection help the dairy farmers of New South Wales? We exported last year over 7,000,000 lbs. of butter to London and other, markets of the world. From Victoria there went over 26,000,000 lbs. of this article, and the export of butter from Australia altogether amounted to about 53,000,000 lbs. There was no butter imported into Australia, so that the dairy farmers had to contend with no competition in this article. How can there be any system of protection which will raise the price of butter to the dairy farmers ? We are dependent upon the price it brings in London and the other markets of the world. We have to send our produce over 16j000 miles of ocean, and when we get it to London have to compete with Denmark and other countries which are only a few days' sail from that great market. If you are to have a system of protection by which you prevent importations to this country, then those great ocean liners which carry our produce in their refrigerating chambers, instead of coming out to Australia with full bottoms as they do now, will come half or wholly empty. The result will be that, instead of our having freights as they are, the rates will immediately go up. We are handicapped now, and under a protective system we should be still further handicapped. Is it a fair thing to ask that the dairy farmers as well as the great producing bodies of this country shall put their hands in their pockets to establish a system of protection from which they can derive no benefit? What I say as to the butter industry applies equally to all the great primary industries of Australia. Take our wheatgrowing industry. In consequence of the increase of production in New South Wales during the last few years we exported last year from the Commonwealth over 11,000,000 bushels, whilst the importation of wheat into the Commonwealth was nil. I think it must be clear to any honorable member that no system of protection that can. be devised will help the producer of wheat. </para>

              <para>- I am taking the whole Commonwealth. The honorable member himself said that to make comparisons between New South Wales and "Victoria is a mistake. We should deal with these subjects from a national stand-point, and I am endeavouring to discuss the position from that aspect, being as anxious as any honorable member can be that those petty local jealousies which have existed in the past shall no longer have any force.What I have said as to the wheat industry applies to all the great primary industries of Australia. In my constituency large quantities of coal are produced. There are 8,000 or 9,000 men in the northern end of Illawarra who are dependent upon the coal industry. I ask honorable members how, by protection, we can possibly benefit the men engaged in the coal-mining industry ? </para>

              <para>- It is all very well to raise that argument with regard to the production of boots, hats, and such things, but we are largely dependent on the export market in regard to our coal. We have been sending coal to San Francisco, Victoria, and other great markets of the world. If we had kept our coal for the home market, instead of its being worth 16s. to £1 a ton, it would hardly be worth a shilling a ton. We should not be producing anything like the quantity of coal that is now produced in New South Wales if it had been used only in factories. It is far better for us to have the great ocean liners, any one of which consumes more coal than is consumed by all the factories in Victoria in a year, coming to take their cargoes away. </para>

              <para>- No system of protection can possibly benefit the coal industry. There was one other expression made use of by the honorable member for Echuca in regard to his doubt as to the sincerity of the sympathy of free-traders with the workers. I have always, on my part, doubted the sincerity of the protectionists in this respect, and it is remarkable that, before the existence of protection in the world, there was no such thing as sweating known in connexion with the industries. Sweating became rife in England during the time of protection, towards the end of the last century, and since the establishment of freetrade there the system has practically died out, except in those centres where foreign refugees are naturally the victims. </para>

No ; they had not done so, and the workmen were ground down. They must insist on protection to the worker as well as to the employer.

          <para>The condition of the English workman is altogether superior to that prevailing in Germany, but not so good as that in America. The liberals here are, with few exceptions, thorough free-traders. In reply to your inquiry as to whether I think new industries spring up from the adoption of freetrade, I beg to say that the great commerce of England has developed by leaps and bounds since the adoption of free-trade principles. With respect to wages of brass workers, they have increased since 1872 to the extent of between 30 and 40 per cent. , and their hours reduced from60 to 54. </para>
          <para>The condition of the working people in the forties was sad and miserable in the extreme. Provisions of all kinds were dear, and the wages of the workers were low. The hours of labour were long, and work was often scarce. Suffering and distress were everywhere ; riots and bloodshed were frequent. Little children of tender age were obliged to work to help to find bread for the family. Their homes were hovels. </para>
          <para>From about 1850 the conditions of labour began to improve. The improvement has been continuous, and it still goes on with accelerated speed. </para>

            <para>Your inquiry as to my opinion upon the results of free-trade in England, pomes at an appropriate moment. We are just completing ten years of the greatest material prosperity that this country has ever known in all its history. We have been pursuing a free-trade policy, that is a Tariff for revenue only, without protection to native industry, for half a century. During that time (as I have described in detail in my little book, " Labour in the Longest Reign ") the condition of the wage earners has greatly and persistently improved. Wages have risen, food and clothing have become cheaper, the working day has become shorter, the employment has become more regular. There is not the ghost of a chance of the English trade unions asking for a protective Tariff. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I may add that I know something of the condition of the workers of France, Germany, Belgium, and other countries of Europe where the policy of protection is in operation. I can testify that the general condition of the worker as regards wages, hours of labour, the standard of living, and everything that conduces to give a healthy and comfortable home-life, is incomparably better in free-trade England than in any of those protectionist countries. </para>

            <para>One may not hastily and dogmatically pronounce all these propositions to be without any foundation ; and it is both useless and mischievous to denounce those who present such views as being mere spoliators, or to say that they are striving as a body to support themselves and those whom they employ at the cost of their neighbours without rendering any true service in return. These views have been and are now held in perfect sincerity and integrity by many of the most upright citizens in this country ; they are still believed to be sound by a very large number of intelligent men, who sustain them without any other purpose than because they fully believe that the welfare of the nation depends upon their being sustained. </para>

              <para>- I forget the exact date, but I was a young man at the time, and I remember well these men going off in their thousands, not because they disliked Victoria, but from the spirit of enterprise and adventure which animated them and which brought them here at first. We had to send for them, and bring them back again, because they did not get any gold. Then who were they who, after the Scotch, settled the Southern Island of New Zealand? In my time, 20,000 men went from Victoria to New Zealand, not because they disliked this country, or were dissatisfied with their prospects here; but moved by the spirit of adventure. These men helped to make New Zealand. Who were they who, later on, made Broken Hill ? </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend reminds me of what I had almost forgotten ; a fact which, though last to be mentioned, is not least in importance. I ask, who ran up the population of Western Australia from 40,000 to 160,000? Mainly Victorians. Victorians have from the first been Australians. It has often been said that Victoria was more strongly in favour of federation than was any other State. Why was that ? It was because Victorians had set themselves to possess Australia before' the question of federation came up for consideration at all. It is only since the crisis of 1893 that there has been any falling-off in the population of Victoria, and, in my humble opinion, it is unfederal, and, I think, unkind to refer to it. Up to 1893 Victoria and New South Wales kept neck and neck, although the territory of New South Wales is three and a half times as large as that of Victoria, and her resources,, therefore, much greater ; but when that terrible calamity which all of us have good reason to remember fell upon Victoria, our people received a stunning blow, from which it took us years to recover, but from which we have recovered. Many of our people went away - not because of any question of protection or free-trade. They went like men to earn a living elsewhere, because the State in which many of them had wives and families was for the time being unable to afford them the sustenance they required. I trust that we shall have no more of these comparisons. I have given honorable members my defence of Victoria. I have told the House why our people left this State for a time. Are honorable members aware that between 1892 and 1894, between 50,000 and 60,000 people left the city of Melbourne, and that we have since gained back that number, and 3,000 persons in addition? Why was it that the financial crisis was so severely felt in Victoria ? My right honorable friend the Treasurer had to bear the brunt of it, and I think that it took a good deal out of him. He received instructions from the electors - and I do not think they were quite wise instructions - that he was not to spend any more money than he could help. From spending £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 of loan money a year, as the Government had been doing for years past, they came to spend almost nothing, and that cessation of Government expenditure came on top of the dearth of private employment which was the consequence of the financial crisis. My opinion all along was that at that time the Government ought to have borrowed and spent money reasonably on necessary works in order to give our population employment, and thus help us over the stile. </para>

              <para>- Possibly they are more Scotch. I want to remind the House of a few facts which account for the mildness of the crisis in New South Wales compared with its severity in Victoria. Are honorable members aware that, during the ten years which have elapsed since the time to which I am referring, New South Wales has steadily spent over £2,000,000 of loan money per annum, while the average annual loan expenditure of Victoria has been only £500,000 ? The net amount of loan money spent in New South Wales from the years 1892-93 to the year 1900 has been £12,564,000, while the amount spent by Victoria has been only £4,000,000. Then, during the last eighteen years, there has been an expenditure of capital amounting on the average to £1,200,000 per annum. The expenditure is going on now. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; to the expenditure of the proceeds derived from the selling of Crown lands. It is only fair to admit that we are doing the same thing in Victoria ; but we are doing it on a much more limited scale. We are no better than the people of New South Wales so far as principle is concerned, but we have not had so much land to sell. I think we get - is it £400,000 from that source? </para>

              <para>- The honorable member does not quite follow me. I am referring to the proceeds of land sales. I believe it is overstated. I do not think it is £300,000 that we get. New South Wales gets between £700,000 and £800,000 from rents, which it quite legitimately spends as revenue. I do not know what we receive from rents, but the amounts I am dealing with are the proceeds of the sales of land, which is practically the capital of the country. An extraordinary thing happened when the leader of the Opposition - and I am sorry that he is not here, because he is interested in the question - took control of the finances of New South Wales. He found them in a great state of confusion, and I think the honorable member for Wentworth, on that occasion, made a very strong speech with regard to the position of affairs. </para>

              <para>- The figures for the other States are : Queensland, 50 ; New South Wales, 48 ; Victoria, 30. It will be seen that the return for Victoria is far better than for New South Wales in regard to bad debts ; and that is. a very good gauge as to whether a country is anything like " dead broke " or not. That is the point I wish to enlarge upon, because the argument with regard to Victoria is that protection has nearly ruined her. AVe are told that Victoria is ill and we do not feel it. We do not see any symptoms of illness ; and we, therefore, tell honorable members opposite that if they want to prove their freetrade arguments they will have to go upon a different tack altogether, and find some other grounds for their contention. One other point was made by the leader of the Opposition, and has been utilized by the press. We are told that Victoria, owing to her protectionist policy, is bringing the women and children into the factories and making the men walk the streets in enforced idleness: That is a very strong point with the leader of the Opposition. I am sorry I did not bring his exact remarks, but I think I have correctly stated his point. Well, the other day Miss Cuthbertson, a very competent woman, who is the chief female, inspector of factories for Victoria, made a statement in which she alludes to this point. She says, very fairly, that the charge that our system excludes men from employment, while women and children are being employed in the factories, would, if it were the case, " be an absolute blot not only on our factory legislation but on our civilization." But it is not true. That is the misfortune of these statements - they are telling as arguments for free-trade, but they are not true. I will tell the House why. I do not desire to read all that Miss Cuthbertson says, but I will give the gist of it. She points out that, from 18S6 to 1891, there was a steady increase of males and females employed in our factories. In .1891 the crisis came. From 1891 to -1894 there was a diminution in the numbers of both males and females employed. In 1894 an Act was passed which brought under the factory law places in which four or more persons were employed. Miss Cuthbertson very fairly starts her comparison from 1 894, a time when she had a satisfactory ground upon which to make it. In 1894 there were employed in the factories of Victoria 23,164 males and 11,104 females. In 1899 there were employed 31,649 males and 17,897 females. These figures show an increase of males in the period of 8,485, and an increase of females of 6,793. Miss Cuthbertson points out - and this is the answer to those precious statistics which are used in such an indiscriminate fashion - that 4,000 out of these 6,793 females were employed in the dress-making mantlemaking, clothing, and shirt trades, which, are pre-eminently women's employments, and at which men could hardly work. As to the remaining 2,700, it would take too long to read the list of trades, but I will show the return to any honorable member who wishes to see it. Miss Cuthbertson gives the increase in every trade, and the result is that the 2,700 are fully accounted for. She says in her closing remarks - </para>

            <para>I think it cannot be denied that the progress of free-trade has been materially retained by its advocates assuming a too contemptuous tone towards the supporters of protection in other countries. We in England are much too prone to overstate the results of free-trade. Scarcely a week elapses without its being said, as if it were a triumphant rejoinder to all that is urged by the American, the continental, or the colonial protectionist, "English exports and imports have more than quadrupled since protection was abolished : the income of the country, as shown by the yield of the income tax, has more than doubled, wages have advanced, and population has increased." </para>

              <para>- I am not desirous of suppressing anything. If the honorable member can show that I am suppressing anything let him trot it out. I have learnt too much from discussing matters with free-traders to fall into that mistake and I always look round my argument to see if there be any vulnerable point before I put it forward. It will not do to tell us, as we are told every day, that Great Britain is prosperous. We know she is prosperous ; but there are a great many things, as Professor Fawcett points out, which have built up that prosperity, and these things are well known. I am going to bring forward an argument tonight, and I want to guard myself against doing that to which objection has just been taken. I am going to make a statement with regard to the progress of Great Britain, and also other countries, notably the United States. It is not my purpose to show that the protectionist policy is the right one because America, Germany, or any other country has got ahead of England at a certain time. I simply want to call attention to the position of those countries, and to ask my free-trade friends the question : if free-trade is a heaven-sent inspiration, John Bright admitted it was not given from Mount Sinai, although he said it was equally strong in favour of freedom and for the benefit of the people, or something of that sort- </para>

Now, I may tell honorable members, although, perhaps, it is not very interesting, that the Corn Laws were abolished just about the time that I caine into this world, and I was brought up under the full inspiration of the wave of feeling that occurred then. But when I began to grow up, and to take an interest in this question, I can assure the House that the first thing which shook my confidence in the Cobden doctrine was the fact that whilst the free-traders had always been predicting that the United States would come to grief, it never came off. </para>

I confess that I am not here to-night to prove a thing which I thought would meet with universal acceptance ; but, if the honorable member for Werriwa will give me an opportunity, I will produce authority for my statement later on. What I want to say is this : that we have had prominently brought before our attention two countries in which we can trace clearly and unmistakably two lines of fiscal policy. Those countries are Great Britain and the United States. Now, Great Britain, as we know, is a very much older country than the United States. Perhaps the honorable member will contradict me on that point ? </para>

              <para>- I am glad to hear of the limitation. Great Britain in 1801 - the earliest year that I could get comparative figures for - had a population of 15,717,000, and the United States in 1790 - ten years before - had just about the population that this Federation starts with, or 3,930,000. In 1889, Great Britain had 37,809,000 and the United States 62,481,000, and those figures have been increased, I believe, by the last census to 42,000,000 and 82,000,000, respectively. Of course, I mark the impatience of some honorable members. They know all about this, and I am aware that they know it, but I want to bring it to their minds in order to impress it upon them, because it seems to me that many of those honorable members allow facts to glide over them like water over a duck's back. I intend giving a very few figures, and I would like the attention of those honorable members to whom I refer, for about two minutes. The wealth of Great Britain in 1800 was £1,740,000,000, whilst in 1790 that of the United States was £129,000,000. In 188S, the wealth of Great Britain was £9,400,000,000, whilst that of the United States was represented by £12,824,000,000. The earnings of Great Britain were represented by £34 per head in 1889, and in the United States by £39 per head in 1886-89. Ill the savings bank in 1889 Great Britain had deposits amounting to £107,000,000, and the United States had deposits totalling £283,000,000. I mention these facts to show that a country which started its career with 12,000,000 of people less than Great Britain, and which has reclaimed a great territory, is certainly a country that has not been ruined by her fiscal policy. </para>

            <para>The capital employed in purchasing foreign goods for homo consumption when this purchase is made with the produce of domestic industry, replaces too by every such operation two distinct capitals, but one of them only is employed in supporting domestic industry. The capital which sends British goods to Portugal, and brings back Portuguese goods to Great Britain, replaces by such operation only one British capital. The other is a Portuguese one. Though the returns therefore of the foreign trade of consumption should be as quick as those of home trade, the capital employed in it will give but one-half the encouragement to the industry or productive labour of the country. A capital, therefore, employed in the home trade will sometimes make twelve operations - or be sent out and returned twelve times - before a capital employed in the foreign trade pf consumption has made one. If the capitals are equal therefore, the one will give four-and -twenty times more encouragement and support to the industry of the country than the other. </para>

            <para>It is nob a small difference in price that can compensate the nation for the loss. For example, Suppose England can produce an article for£100, and can import it for £99. By importing it instead of producing it she gains £1, and, though she pays for it with her own manufactures, loses £100 of wealth which she might have created : that is to say, on the balance, she loses £99 which she might have had in addition by producing commodities at home. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member says it is exploded. I have always noticed that English economists give a very gentle go-by to all the arguments coming from America or continental countries. They pass them by because they do not wish to raise a discussion. But I ask honorable members to explain to me how it is that in every case in those countries revenue has increased, industries have increased, and wealth has increased since the adoption of that policy. If there is a better reason than the one I have given to account for it, I am open to hear it, and I am open to be convinced. But the fault of the free-trade idea is this : It is a grand conception, but it does not apply to the circumstances of this world. It was not until 75 years after Adam Smith wrote his book that his opinions were taken up at all, and then gentlemen of the Manchester school took up only that part which suited them. It was a grand conception. They said - All men are brothers - Chinese, Japanese, and every one else; we will have free-trade. But they knew very well that that was after having had 200 years' protection after they had had the advantage of the. inventions of Watt and Arkwright and others, and after they had had during the long war practically the whole trade of the world outside of the continent, and a good deal of that through smuggling. It was very well for them to say to every one - " Let things remain as they are, and we will supply your wants ; we will import your raw material, and we will work it up, make a profit in the shipping, in the making-up of the goods, and in sending them back to you." It was a grand conception, if all were on the same plane. Cobden, as set forth in a book which I have here, said in one of his speeches that he hoped the day would come when we would be all one and when we would be governed by a sort of glorified municipal government. We were to have no nations and no patriotism ; but human nature does not go that way, and that is the mistake of the whole idea. It is seeking to apply a system to human nature which human nature will not have, and to which human nature will not adapt itself. When honorable members speak to me about Great Britain, I say that I feel the greatest doubt as to the position there. And in that I am not singular, because many of the best men in Great Britain have serious doubts on the subject. We know that the leading men there are finding that Gladstone made a great mistake in so largely reducing the number of taxable articles. That comes up every time there is a difficulty about revenue. They regret that they introduced free-trade to the extent they did. While we are dealing with the question of the position of things in England, I will read a word or two from a book, the author of which does not give his name. </para>

              <para>- Yes ; it is " Drifting." It is anonymous, and probably some honorable members will not believe it on that account. But I will just give you what is pointed out in this book, and if any honorable member can show me it is wrong, then I am open to be contradicted. The writer points out that the exports of British manufactured goods fell, between 18S4 and 1898, from £94,000,000 to £65,000,000. </para>

              <para>- Chiefly coal, and that went up to double its value. Of course, I am merely arguing in this way so as to get honorable members to realize that, in starting the affairs of this new nation, we ought to give due consideration to all these facts. We ought to ascertain from them, so far as they can guide us, what is the right course to pursue. Honorable members may laugh, and those who know the conditions of business in the old country may be held up to opprobrium ; but I have read a letter written to the newspapers by Lord Masham, who, before he was made a peer, was the head of the largest silk concern in Great Britain, in which he points out that the silk trade of England has been absolutely ruined, and he attributes its ruin to the want of protection. He points out that the people of England have apparently made up their minds to do without a silk trade, and that, if so, they have only to let things remain as they are in order to bring it to an end. He shows most plainly that free-trade is a craze which seized the British people, but from which they are now recovering. I saw very marked signs of that recovery when I was home in the years 1895 and 1896. I heard an honorable gentleman speak to-night about what the leaders of the unions have to say on this subject; but, in my opinion, the leaders of the unions will change their views on this subject, as they have changed their views on other subjects, whenever they find the shoe pinching them; and they are beginning to find it pinching them now. In my boyhood, if you went into a shop or commercial establishment in Great Britain, you would not see a foreign article in the place ; but now nine out of ten of the articles on the shelves have come from America, Germany, Belgium, and other countries. No country can go on importing foreign manufactures at that rate, and for Australia at this stage of its development to think of subjecting itself to the competition of the world, as some honorable members would have us do, is mere madness. What I plead for is that honorable members will try to realize the position in which we are placed, and open their minds and increase their knowledge - I, on my part, am ready to hear anything that may be said on the other side - so that when we come to legislate on this question we may deal with it in a way that will be satisfactory to the people, and, what is of more importance, in a manner which we may feel assured will bring about results which will be conducive to the future welfare of this country. </para>

              <para>- I could easily cap the honorable member's interjection ; but I am not going to be led aside, because I want to conclude my remarks. I need only say that we have heard statements like that before. I have already alluded to the very serious position in which the Constitution Act has placed us in regard to the imposition of a uniform Tariff. There is a phrase in the provision of the Constitution which deals with the Tariff, which seems to me to need a good deal of explanation ; it is the phrase - " after the imposition of uniform custom duties." In my opinion, the financial sections of the Constitution - and I have never held two opinions on the subject - are about the most unsatisfactory part of the work of the Convention. I have tried to project my mind into a consideration of the condition of things which may occur when we begin to work this financial machinery. The honorable member for Bendigo has expressed the opinion that, in order to get over the preliminary difficulty in regard to the collection of uniform duties immediately their intended imposition is announced, an Act might be passed to validate such a proceeding; but the honorable member for Indi has given it as his opinion that that would not meet the case, and I, as a layman, agree with him. The point is one to which I should like the Minister for Trade and Customs to give his attention. According to the provision in the Constitution, certain things are to happen upon the imposition of a uniform Tariff. One thing which is to happen is that intercolonial free-trade must at once ensue. Another thing is that from the time of the imposition of the uniform Tariff all goods imported into any State prior to such imposition and exported within two years to another State, must pay duty equal to the federal duty. </para>

              <para>- Yes, that is what I should like ; but the Government do not mean to do that. Of course there would be the "imposition of a uniform Tariff" if that course were followed. But I am assuming that the course which has- ordinarily been adopted by the State Treasurers will be followed. If that course is followed, then, unless you have imposed a Tariff on the day you make the change, and if instead of doing that you allow a two months interregnum, yon must, in many cases, collect two Tariffs, and, in addition, where goods are taken from one State to another, it may happen that you cannot charge additional duties upon them, because no "imposition of a uniform Tariff" has taken place. </para>

              <para>- That is my contention. I want honorable members to try to understand the complication of affairs which I am afraid will come about. It is a thicket, and I do not see my way through it. Ministers may see their way, but it seems to me that, in order to get over all difficulties - I did not know then that the honorable member for Bendigo had made the suggestion - that one of two courses should be adopted, which I am much afraid will not be done. One course would be for the Ministry to take the responsibility of making a fair Tariff on the principles they laid before the country, as I believe they will do, and for both Houses to agree to pass it in one night, and afterwards it could be altered if necessary. </para>

              <para>- Practically a provisional Tariff. The other course is to pass a Bill to enable the Ministry to enact a Tariff by proclamation within so many mouths, so that they could choose the time when they were read)7, and it could be done at once without any trouble. But I fear from the views which have been enunciated here that this question of free-trade or protection will come in, and honorable members will not trust the Government to act equitably and fairly. Either of these two courses, it seems to me, would be pre-eminently the best for the interests of the country and to save confusion, and, if it were possible, we could continue the Tariff, if it was a fair one, for five years, until the expiry of the bookkeeping system, which is another frightful complication. In the meantime, we could have the question of whether we are going to be freetraders or protectionists, or betwixt and between, discussed and settled. "What we have to do is to raise £8,500,000, and to do it in such a way that we shall not disturb the interests of the country, that we shall not interfere with the financial position of the people of the country. I know that already in the Commonwealth, especially in New South Wales, a furious speculation is going on in regard to the effects of this Tariff, and if great caution is not taken I believe that its results will be exceedingly disastrous. I would press the Government, especially the Minister who is in charge of this matter, to consider well the possible result. I confess that I do not see how we can get out of it except by one of the means I have suggested, and neither of which I fear will be adopted by the House, because we shall have King Charles' head dragged in, and that is that free-trade must be the policy of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, we shall fight any proposals that in any way depart from that principle, even although we know that we shall have an opportunity of dealing with the question later on. I hope that a more reasonable spirit will prevail, but it seems to me that in any case, the greatest circumspection and care will be required to avert a very great loss to the revenue as well as to the people of this country. </para>

              <para>- I have already dealt with the case where the verdict goes against the men, and shown how impossible it would be to make them go back to work at wages with which they were discontented. Take the case of employers. I am supposing an instance where the difference between the men and their employers is not one that has arisen through some hasty circumstance which has not been thoroughly considered, but a strike about matters upon which it has not been possible to come to an agreement. If a higher wage is fixed, do the Government propose to compel the employers to pay it ? If so, another court may step in, and that is the Court of Insolvency, which may compel the masters to pay only such wages as are consistent with profits. I object to measures being brought into this House and given names that do not properly describe them. We are not here to court popularity, but to legislate for the benefit of Australia as a whole. We are not here to give popular names to measures that are not workable, but to advance the interests of the general community. </para>

              <para>- I trust so. In many honorable members opposite there is as true an interest in the affairs of Australia as there is even in myself. But, having said that much, I will add that they will only act according to the knowledge they have in them. Another matter that has been brought forward by the Prime Minister is in regard to the amount of money that must be raised by means of the Tariff. He has said that it is necessary to raise no less than £8,500,000, by Customs and Excise, and that some measure of taxation, designed to bring in that revenue, will be submitted to this House. The amount of revenue collected from Customs and Excise last year in Australia was £7,4=00,000. It will be a very bad thing indeed for the Federal Government to go beyond that amount. The answer given by the Prime Minister to one interjector was, that we must consider the interests of the smaller States and the revenue they require. To that I reply, that we are considering the interests of the smaller States when we refuse to impose any greater taxation upon Australia than is absolutely necessary for the purposes of government. In lessening the load of taxation upon the smaller States, as we shall do if we do not propose the raising of not more than £7,400,000 through the customs, we shall be allowing a full opportunity for the development of the revenue in a hundred other directions. The whole experience of government in the past shows that the more you lighten taxation through Customs and Excise the freer play you give for the revenue to advance in other ways. In England at the time of the corn laws there was a class objection to the duties being removed. She was then suffering from annual deficits of nearly a million. The teaching of political economists was that, if the Government swept away three-fourths of the duties then imposed, the}' would receive more revenue in other directions. They did so, and got what they required. We must not lose sight of the fact that the greatest of the States, and the one which contains one-third of the whole population of the Commonwealth, is perfectly convinced that a Tariff producing £6,000,000 would give her back all the revenue she requires. Such a Tariff would give New South Wales every penny she needs, and it would also, I take it, produce the £1,500,000 which will be sufficient for all the requirements of the Federal Government, unless there is to be some extraordinary increase in the military vote. As to that, if the experience of the -last Boer war has shown anything it is that we can considerably lessen our military expenditure. So far from increasing the military vote, our object should be to decrease it very considerably indeed, by lessening the military establishments of the various States. That can be done without injury to any one. Our defences would then devolve upon our citizen soldiery. </para>

              <para>- Yes, our military establishments are costing .something like £500,000 a year, and there is too great an expenditure upon what I call the trappings of militarism. It is our duty to get away from that bad system altogether. I believe that New South Wales is content for the purpose of preserving the Union to allow the Tariff to go up to £7,000,000, which would be ample to give the Federal Government all it requires for some time to come. If we start with a low Tariff, we shall still leave a taxable reserve for the Federal Government to draw upon as soon as the 87th section is amended, as amended I believe it must be. Even then the Federal Government will be able to extend its powers in many other directions. We have been told that there is only one way in which the revenue can be collected, and that we can have no direct taxation so far as the Federation is concerned. We have been assured that we must raise an extra amount to pay back to the smaller States what they require. </para>

              <para>- The whole argument of the Ministry has- been that a certain amount of the high duties must be kept ap. As a strong free-trader, I object to taxation of any sort whatever, and any taxation beyond that necessary for the sound and honest administration of the country represents to my mind, a sum taken directly from industry itself. It lessens the amount of capital in the community, and consequently increases the burden on the poor. We have been told that- we- ought to ask ourselves what protection- means ; but the sentence is never finished by protectionists. Protection means protection' to the manufacturing class. As we are now exporting our agricultural products, there clearly can be no protection so far as 'the agriculturist is concerned ; as it is and always has been in the past, there clearly can be no protection so far as a miner is concerned, and there clearly can be no protection so far as the pastoralist is concerned. Therefore, we at once fall : back on the one class which, by any' stretch of the imagination, duties can be said to benefit, namely, the manufacturing ; class. . And the manufacturing class do riot-always receive the full amount of -the tax, because sometimes it costs far more to produce the article than the price they can at first get for it, and certainly far more than, the price at which the people of the country could get it elsewhere. Why should we seek to limit trade in any way whatever? Trade is the natural exchange that goes on ; and I, for one, have never asserted - nor have I. heard it asserted - that free trade is, a panacea for all ills. We only assert that free-trade means allowing the natural exchange which goes on between- individuals, to go on just as freely between nations. No amount of argument can alter that great natural law. Why in ' protectionist America do people congregate at ports like New York, or places like Chicago, if not because these places offer the best advantages for trade ? Why do people congregate in a place like Melbourne ? Because Melbourne offers the best facilities for trade. If the protectionist argument be right, and the desire be to keep employment and money in the country, all that it would be necessary to do in order to start thousands of carriers, employ farmers to breed horses for those carriers, waggoners to drive the horses and blacksmiths to shoe them, carriage builders to make the waggons, and harness-makers to make all the harness, would be to pass a law removing Melbourne 50 miles inland. If one class is worthy of consideration, the classes engaged in all these industries - and look at the amount of indirect employment that would be afforded in other directions - are just as deserving of consideration. But protectionists never do carry out their argument in this respect. In spite of them trade always congregates at places where the best facilities are offered. The honorable member for Moreton said that so. far as he was concerned, he could see no difference between allowing cheap goods to come in and allowing cheap 'labour to come in. I trust I may be allowed to explain the very great difference there is. I will take as an illustration the matter of tea, which is produced by Chinese cheap labour. It is perfectly clear that wages are determined absolutely by supply and demand, and, of course, by the amount of capital there is to divide amongst the workmen here. </para>

              <para>- Wages are determined exactly by the amount of capital there is in a country, and the number of workmen offering for employment. If there are two workmen, and only capital to afford sufficient employment for one, wages clearly go down. If there is one workman, and capital for two, wages just as clearly go up, and the amount of wages is limited solely by the amount of capital there is offering for workers. That being so, with wages at ls. an hour here, it would be to the advantage of the local workmen if, instead of his tea being ls. per lb., the price from some cause or other were to fall to 3d., because he would then have to work only a quarter of an hour to obtain exactly the same quantity of tea he had previously to work a full hour for. </para>

              <para>- Capital is the accumulated product of the labour of a community, and it cannot be obtained by making things at a loss. That is the point I should like honorable members to bear in mind. It is only when a thing produced is worth more than it cost to produce that there can be any capital at all created ; and honorable members can realize that in a dozen cases. If a man be put on to work in a mine at £2 10s. a week, and the mine only produces 30s. worth of gold, so far sis the community is concerned there is a loss of £1. If a man be put to work at a trade at £2 10s. a week, and he produces an article only worth 30s., it is clear the community have lost £1 ; and not only that, but the workman has not gained by being employed in an unproductive work, because he would have been producing something else in some other line. A very different result, indeed, is obtained if, instead of allowing a free exchange of goods we allow workmen who have been accustomed to work at Id. per hour to come to our employers and say they will work for that rate of wage. It is perfectly true that wages, following the same law of supply and demand, would then show a tendency to fall to the rate of Id., and would undoubtedly do so. As showing how entirely the rate of wages is dependent on supply and demand in a particular locality, and on the amount of capital there, we have only to go to Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie, where, with a large influx of capital ready to be put into the mines, men got £4 and £5 a week, because there were not sufficient men offering themselves for employment. But the moment that the men crowded in, and the amount of capital to be divided amongst them became less, the wages began to fall. If the protectionist arguments are perfectly right, then, instead of the" men being crowded at the ports, we would see them up in the furthest parts of Central Australia, because those parts offer a natural protection. I suppose that in the centre of South Australia, or in portions even of the Northern Territory - if that is taken over by the Federal Government - there are fine localities for the establishment of all these manufactures, because there they would have a natural protection of not less than 300 or 400 per cent. </para>

              <para>- I think the honorable member for Melbourne Ports would tear up that letter and throw it in the waste-paper basket, and I can quite conceive that if he received such a letter from a foreigner he would laugh and show it all round the House. Therefore what becomes of the argument that it is the foreigner who pays the tax. How can it be ? Trade is merely an exchange of goods for goods, commodities for commodities, and any interference with it must be wrong. People only trade because it is to their advantage to trade, there is no law to compel them to do it, and they must be making some gain. The moment, therefore, there is any interference on the part of the Government or any one else, some injury must result. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to any articles which demand a Tariff before they can be produced. It is quite clear that the community has to bear this burden, and I ask why should it be necessary to impose it. We are, of course, told sometimes that the importer pays the tax. Well, if it is the importer who pays it, and if he does not pass it on ; if we have a body of charitable men meeting together, and agreeing to pay £8,000,000 of money which they will not pass on to others, perhaps honorable members on the other side would not mind mentioning them to us, and we should be only too glad to know them. What is the meaning of the words "indirect taxation, " unless it is taxation collected from a person with the expectation and intention that he will indemnify himself at the expense of others 1 Clearly, therefore, if they have to pay these duties, it is equally clear that we have to pay not only the* same amount, but interest also to compensate them for putting the capital down in the first place. Even the protectionists themselves recognise this clearly, in the way in which they allow the establishment of bonded stores. They admit that it is not well to collect the duty too soon, and therefore they allow the goods to be put into bond without paying any taxation. "What is that but an admission on the part of the protectionists, and on the part of the Government, that this taxation must eventually fall on the people 1 As far &amp;s possible, the principle of equality of sacrifice ought to be followed in any taxation measures that the Government propose. No one should be allowed to escape entirely' scot free, because all of us are equally interested in the preservation of law and order, and, therefore, to that extent, taxation through the Customs is perfectly allowable. But the further amount that is needed to look after the interests of property and for the thousand and one works which are required ought to come from wealth alone. We have been told by honorable members that they see no difference between revenue and protective duties. I think the clearest answer that can be given to that is an illustration of what will take place if only an import duty is placed upon sugar and no excise. The production of sugar throughout Australia, last year, was about 140,000 tons. The consumption is something like 150,000 tons at the very least, so that with a customs duty on sugar at £5 a ton, something like £50,000 only will - be paid to the Treasurer, while the great sugar companies of New South Wales and Queensland would take something like £720,000 extra on sugar, which would have to be paid by the people Well, sir, this is an instance of a protectionist Tariff, and if we do adopt that principle here, then, as far as a customs duty on sugar is concerned, £50,000 only will go into the Treasury, while the enormous sum of £720,000 will go to enrich the company. That is what the Prime Minister, in order to enrich that sugar company and get the support of its shareholders, would carry out. I trust, however, that it is not the policy this Parliament is going to follow. If that money is going to be collected from the people of Australia we will take great care that the excise duty, less a certain amount for its collection, equals it, and see that if the people pay a tax on that one item to the extent of £770,000 by a customs' duty of £5 pelton, that the whole of it, as far as practicable, shall go into the Treasury. We could go on multiplying instances of this kind one after another. </para>

              <para>- That, sir, is absolutely the policy which the Prime Minister, when' he went up to Queensland,' said he would propose. He said he proposed to put a' customs duty on sugar, and that he objected to an excise duty on it because he was a protectionist. Therefore, one cannot be wrong in saying that this is what the right' honorable gentleman intends to do. The Government have declared themselves to a certain extent protectionist, and I have given clear instances of the -wrong that will happen to the people of the Commonwealth. - how they will be taxed, and how those taxes will fall upon the bulk of the consumers if that policy is carried into effect. No wonder that when the Prime Minister went to Queensland the shareholders of the sugar company welcomed him as a brother, and said he was the greatest and finest man that ever lived. No wonder they did so, because they saw the prospect of something like £3,000,000 coming into their pockets. </para>

I hold in my hand an extract from a book recently published in connexion with the American Tariff, which shows most forcibly that the same force of things applies to the great accumulations of property. During the last ten years, from 1850 to 1860, when a low Tariff was in force, there was an enormous increase of real and personal property - 103 per cent. From 1800 to 1870, when there was a jump in the Tariff of 100 per cent., the rate of increase was pulled up, being only 39 per cent. . And from 1870 to 1 880 with a higher Tariff, it was still further arrested, being at the rate of only 10 per cent. </para>

              <para>-The honorable member went on to speak about freeing the producers from the shackles protection imposed on them. I quite agree with him. If we look at the earliest dawn of trade, we find that those countries which offered the best facilities for trading were the places which prospered. I can refer honorable members to the great trading cities of Tyre and Sidon. Those cities clearly flourished under free-trade. It was not understood in those times why they flourished, because people then did not understand the meaning of free-trade. I heard the honorable, member for Newcastle say that the people of his electorate did not want goods to enter the Newcastle harbor. I wish he could have lived in the early days of Rome. I wonder what the people of Rome would have said if he had made a similar statement to them when £20,000,000 worth of goods were coming to Rome every year. The Roman people were glad to receive those goods, because they were the tribute of other nations, and they got them at the lowest possible price ; in fact, they obtained them for nothing at all. But when the reign of the emperors began, they imposed a tax upon the importation of goods, which, although at first it amounted to only 5 per cent., afterwards rose to 20 per cent., and ultimately to 50 per cent. But the emperors did not go about among the people to try to persuade them that this taxation was to their advantage. They never said to them - "This is for your benefit." They levied these duties merely as a tax, and the people recognised that they ' were a tax. </para>

              <para>- It was not until the emperors put this tax upon the importation of goods that Rome began to decline. Of course, if the honorable member, has studied his history, he will find other causes for the decay of the Roman Empire ; but, since he has made that interjection, I must point out that it was after the imposition of these duties by the emperors that Rome began to decline. Duties can do no more than create a hindrance to trade ; they cannot stamp out the intelligence or manhood of a community. It would be a terrible thing if they could, and I do not for a moment make such an assertion. I only assert that every disability you place upon people does injury to them, and every penny you take from a community by way of taxation lessens the amount of capital available for purposes of production, and therefore injures the community. </para>

              <para>- A destruction of capital follows, just as a destruction of capital occurs if the crops of a farm are burned or destroyed by drought. One may say that they are still in the country ; but it would be of very little use to tell that to the farmer who had lost his all by their disappearance. The imposition of customs duties undoubtedly tends to discourage trade, and, by imposing taxation upon a community, you lessen the amount of its capital. It is only from the accumulated produce of labour, which is capital, tha? wages can be paid. I hope that Ministers, in drawing up their scheme of taxation, will try to make it as light as possible, and that we have heard the last of the contention that by taxing the people you can give employment to them, and make the country rich. </para>

            <para>. - I. trust that we shall come to a conclusion of the debate at a sufficiently early hour to-morrow to be able to go on then with other business. Honorable members will recognise that I have not endeavoured to put any undue pressure upon them to bring the debate to a conclusion, and that I have not tried to curtail their right of speech in any way. But, if I mistake not, this is the eighth night of the debate, and I think that we might reasonably come to a conclusion very shortly. The matters embraced in the speech are numerous, and Bills covering those matters will be introduced during the session, so that there will be opportunity for all of us to discuss them later on. I appeal to the generosity of honorable members to enable the business of the country to be proceeded with by bringing the debate to a close tomorrow evening before half -past six. I understand that that proposition has the concurrence of my honorable friend opposite. </para>
