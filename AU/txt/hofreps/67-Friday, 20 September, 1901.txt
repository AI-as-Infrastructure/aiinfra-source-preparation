          <para>- This may not be a novel clause, inasmuch as the Minister may be able to tell us that it exists in some of the State Acts, but I do not know that it has ever been enforced. The definition clause does not define material, but beyond stating that it includes all material used in the manufacture of. excisable goods. "When we think of the various things that are used in the manufacture of excisable goods, we shall see that the clause makes a very wide provision. Potatoes are used as material for the manufacture of excisable goods, and I would ask whether every man who grows potatoes is to be registered as a producer. It is true that the materials that are to come under the operation of this clause are to be declared by proclamation, but I have not that implicit faith in and unhesitating love for proclamations that many of our Bills seem to display, and I doubt the wisdom of enabling any Minister to compel every one who has a little patch of potatoes to register himself as a producer. Under this clause every grower of barley might be compelled to register as a producer, and I do not see what benefit is to be derived from this unnecessary restriction. It is when the goods go into the factories in which they are to be made up that the control of the Customs should begin, and no attempt should be made to go further than that. Excise duty is charged, for example, on manufactured tobacco, and so long as the control in the factory is complete, I do not see how the Customs or Excise can be concerned except for statistical purposes. </para>

            <para>- It is impossible to find the intention of an Act of Parliament except from the words, and the words of the clause include the cases I have mentioned. I see no advantage to be gained by insisting on those people registering themselves, because when the produce gets into the factory it is under direct Customs or Excise supervision, and the revenue is properly protected. The supposed gain is doubtful, and, at any rate, small, while the possible disadvantage is very great; and I ask the Minister to let this part of the clause go. There are cases in which we cannot avoid giving these great powers, but they should never be given unless it be inevitable. </para>

            <para>- It is highly desirable to keep an eye on the growth of tobacco. For the purpose of securing the revenue, we ought to know where excisable material is being produced, when it is being produced for sale or manufacture, or otherwise the Customs are liable to be imposed on in a variety of ways. The clause cannot be applied in the cases referred to by the honorable and learned member, but where it is advisable to exercise such a power that can be done simply and effectively by proclamation. There is no fee charged for registration, and under the circumstances a grower of tobacco ought to tell us where it is produced and where it goes. If we lose this control we shall be deprived of one of the greatest guarantees which can exist for the protection of the revenue. </para>

            <para>- But not until, perhaps, a considerable time after the proclamation. The Minister, when he brings in the Bill which will be the basis of the necessity for the proclamation, can take power to get authority from Parliament. According to this Bill, the Minister may issue a proclamation during the recess or at any other time and require certain troublesome regulations to be complied with. There might in the future be necessity for an excise even on other materials grown which are not actually used in manufacture. Tobacco actually comes within this category, and I know -that in New South Wales a good deal of leaf tobacco is sold and smoked without undergoing any manufacture. </para>

            <para>- I have spoken in favour of the clause, but I point out that this article is not manufactured, being sold as it is produced. There might be other similar cases, especially now that the Tariff will embrace the whole Commonwealth. There might be an import duty on rice, and an excise may be found desirable, seeing that this material is likely to be produced largely in the Commonwealth. These are merely illustrations of cases which are not provided for in the Bill. </para>

The Minister will not issue pro- " clamations in respect of all minor materials used in the manufacture of excisable goods. There are, for example, a number of minor articles used in the manufacture of tobacco, in respect of which the Minister would not dream of issuing proclamations. If honorable members will kindly allow the clause to stand, the Government will be responsible for any proclamations that may be issued, and the House will have absolute control. The slightest expression of opinion by the House on the subject will lead to the withdrawal or suspension of a proclamation. </para>

            <para>- I would call attention to the fact that this provision is not an alternative, but that two circumstances must exist before the proclamation can issue. The material must be used in the manufacture of excisable goods, and declared by proclamation to be material within the meaning of the Act. I think, therefore, we can trust the Executive with the power, which I should be sorry to see so hedged round with conditions as to prevent its effective exercise. At the same time the clause in the form I propose undoubtedly gives the House power in the matter. </para>

After all the Executive represents the House, and it seems to me absolutely impossible for human ingenuity to so draft every Bill as to allow for every possible contingency.

          <para>- I take it that this clause leaves it to the collector to fix any fee for the licence which he may deem wise and expedient. Considerable controversy has occasionally been caused in Victoria in this connexion, and I should like to know whether the clause will enable the collector to fix the licence-fee at any minimum he may deem advisable. </para>

            <para>- [ look at the question of licences, perhaps, from a somewhat different point of view from the Minister. I am doubtful whether we can really enforce provisions in regard to licences - whether the Commonwealth has power to prevent manufacture except by a licensed person. In Canada I think all fees for licences go to the States, and not to the Federal Government ; and here we are seeking to prevent manufacture, when the prevention is not necessary for the purpose of identification of the goods. I throw this suggestion out for the consideration of the Minister, because the point has struck me in looking at various Excise Acts. I do not think that the Minister should be allowed to cancel a licence which has been issued simply because there has been a breach of one of the minor provisions of this Bill. </para>

          <para>- I wish to ask where the necessity arises to limit the Output of a factory? It is very difficult for a man carrying on business to know exactly how much he will require to manufacture. He probably anticipates that his trade will require the manufacture of a given quantity, but finds that the demand increases. Why should he not be allowed to increase his output in such circumstances ? The only danger to the revenue is that a sliding scale of licence-fees is provided for, and that perhaps the manufacturer has paid the lower fee. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney apparently has not noted that these licences are yearly licences. They are issued upon a sliding scale, I believe, in the interests of the small manufacturer. In "Victoria it has been found necessary to issue £5 licences in order that men who have been thrown out of work may get employment ; but the honorable member must recognise that this means supervision and expense. We must have some return for the additional expense, and beyond that we must have some safeguard whereby the revenue is protected. If we have a multiplication of small factories the honorable member will see that there must be certain restrictions imposed regarding the output, because the greater the number of factories the more difficult it is to exercise supervision over them. A man who applies for a licence will have some reasonable idea of the amount of business which he is likely to do. If he finds at any time that his business has increased to such extent as to warrant it there is nothing to prevent his applying for an extension of his licence.- </para>

It stands to reason that any manufacturer who finds his business increasing to such an extent that the output is likely to exceed the quantity which his licence allows him. to manufacture, will be able to apply for an additional licence or for a licence of a higher character. </para>

          <para>- It seems to me that there is a great deal in the contention of the honorable member for North Sydney. A man may start in a small way of business under a. jJ5 licence. In a few months, possibly, his business may increase to such an extent that he desires to increase his output. If he does increase it he will require under this Bill to take out another licence - a £10 licence. I think that some provision should be inserted whereby the individual shall be allowed to pay the difference between the two licence-fees and to carry on Ins business upon the larger scale. Whilst we desire, in every possible way, to safeguard the revenue, we ought also to be careful that we do not hamper the expansion of business. </para>

            <para>- It is no check at all without the Customs supervision. The statement that a man shall produce only so much is no check without the Customs supervision. How are the Customs authorities to know, except by supervision, that a man who is licensed to manufacture 10,000 lbs. has not produced 20,000 lbs.? Then, again, let us suppose that a man is licensed to produce 12,000 lbs. weight of tobacco in the year. That is equivalent to 1,000 lbs. a month. Are we going to calculate his output by the month? At the end of each month is he not to have produced more than 1,000 lbs. of tobacco? Or are we going to estimate his output by the week or by the day, or is he to be allowed to continue his business for eleven months, by which time he may have produced the 12,000 lbs. which his licence allows him to manufacture? Are we then to say to him - " This is your yearly production. If you produce more, you will have broken your licence" or to say - "You have produced to your full licence and must now close your factory for the balance of the year." The Customs, I take it, want to encourage the small manufacturers ; and if the latter happen to produce something in excess of the quantity which their licences allow, they ought to be permitted to do so by paying the additional sum that is necessary. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for North Sydney has put forward one view of this matter, but there is another side to the question. The Minister desires to encourage the small manufacturers, but I am sure he has no wish to encourage them to compete unfairly with the large manufacturers, who are paying the union rate of wages, and are subject to inspection and sanitary arrangements. In "Victoria, we found some time ago that the larger manufacturers were being severely handicapped by the fact that the £5 licence men worked all hours of the day and night, and subjected them to all sorts of unfair competition. The power of the Minister to regulate the output, to a very great extent, removes that difficulty. It seems to me that even the smallest supervision will be useful in the way I have indicated. To my mind the danger is with the smaller men, and not with the bigger. There is not so much danger of a large factory suspending operations, as there is of the small man working all hours of the night under conditions that are detrimental alike to himself, to the trade, and to the community. </para>

It was found that the man was short of the amount by a shilling, and thereupon the woman, having the idea that he was trying to swindle her, would not let him have the rum at all.

But there is no definition of "Tariff" in the interpretation clause, and I do not know whether the general meaning of the word is what the Bill really means. I would suggest to the Minister that the word might be altered to " excise." " Tariff," to an ordinary layman, relates to Customs duties on imports only, but here we are using the word in regard to excise duties. </para>

            <para>- The amendment affects Queensland, it is true, but only to the extent of taking care that nothing in this Bill shall alter the existing position of affairs. It also affects other States. This amendment gives no new right where a light does not exist, and it takes away no existing rights. If it is not inserted, it may be contended that the rights of these companies are swept away without any consideration. Although it is provided in the last part of the Bill that we shall have power to deal with such cases, this amendment has been introduced so that nothing may be done unless it is intentionally done, and so that any rights that exist may be retained intact. </para>

The Chillagoe line was constructed by a private company, but the public are allowed to use it at certain rates which have been complained of as excessive. I directed the attention of my colleague, the Postmaster-General, to these rates with a view to ascertaining if they could be reduced. He will see that the necessary inquiries are made. We have power to deal with matters of the kind under this Bill, and all that is needed is administrative action, which we are willing to take. The amendment now proposed does not affect the use Of the Chillagoe line by members of the public, but relates only to the use of the line for working the railway line. </para>

            <para>- I think the sooner the Commonwealth Parliament considers the desirability of taking over all telephones and telegraph lines the better. It is advisable that something should be done to* almost compel the Government to take action in this direction at the earliest possible moment. The amendment may mean nothing more than the preservation of existing rights, but as a matter of policy I hold that all telegraphic and telephone services should be under the one control for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

Agreeing with that view, however, I would point out that there is nothing in the amendment that would make the carrying out of that object more difficult, or that would require a single penny more to be paid than under existing conditions.. We are really only inserting this amendment in order to avoid repealing, without intending to do it, any of the State Acts. </para>

An officer of the State may conceivably be construed to have conveyed a right or authority of some kind. The honorable member for Melbourne need not be in the least alarmed. I feel quite sure that as people have been allowed to construct and use lines in the past they will be allowed to use them for their own purposes- in the future, provided they do not affect the public interests. But I do not think we should be justified, in giving a statutory right to those who have no statutory right now. </para>

          <para>- The chief difficulty the honorable member for Melbourne has in his mind is partly met by previous proviso of the clause, but the proviso will have to be made a little clearer. As it appears now in the Bill, there may be a question as to whether an existing private line can be maintained if at any time the Postmaster-General erects a line within 12 feet of it. It would be better if the clause were made to provide that no line hereafter erected shall be within 12 feet of a line of the Postmaster-General's, and that the owner of lines already erected shall not be subject to inconvenience or required to remove them because the Postmaster-General has erected a line within 12 feet of them. </para>

In the Bill we have in several other instances largely interfered with the rights of States. We have interfered still more largely with the rights of municipal institutions, and now we are asked to go back and not only to protect, but to invest with statutory rights certain unknown bodies. who have at present no statutory rights. That would be a very dangerous step, and I trust the honorable member for Melbourne will rest content with the assurance he has received, that existing authorities will be permitted to continue. </para>

We have the result of debates which have taken place in the House of Commons ; we have had despatches with regard to the Natal Act read to us, and we have had opportunities of discovering exactly what is the mind of the Home Government upon this question. We have had also an opportunity of ascertaining the best way of accomplishing our object, and in my opinion the readiest means of bringing it about are -contained in the proposals placed, before us by the Government. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member talks about hypocrisy, and I am surprised to hear that expression used in such a connexion. It would be just as fair for me to accuse of hypocrisy honorable members who are anxious to alter this clause, and make it distasteful to His Majesty's Government, and to other nations, and to say that they are not anxious to have this Bill passed at all. I do not for one moment make such an accusation, but give every credit to them for their opinions, asking for myself the same consideration that' I am prepared to extend to them. I am not hypocritical in the attitude I take up, and I do not believe that the Government are hypocritical or that they are cowardly. I believe that the Government are adopting the best and most ready means of accomplishing the aim we all have in view, and I feel sure that when this clause is brought into operation, as it will be, those who are now of opinion that it will be ineffective will be found amongst its warmest supporters, and will generously agree that they were wrong on this occasion. I feel perfectly satisfied that sentiment has a good deal more to do with their attitude than they think it has. Many of them have seen the ill effects of this alien immigration to a greater extent than we have in the southern States, and I recognise that their attitude is very largely governed by personal experience, and by their great anxiety to keep out the coloured alien. But if they think the}7 are going to keep him out by the means they propose, I am afraid they will be bitterly disappointed. I for one am not prepared to set back the movement, as it will undoubtedly be set back if the amendment is carried. I want this Bill put into operation as rapidly as possible ; and under the circumstances I intend to support the clause with the amendment indicated by the Attorney-General. </para>

          <para>- I felt that it would be wise to speak in committee upon this matter rather than upon the second reading of the Bill, because there is no doubt that the House was greatly influenced by the speech of the Attorney-General, and the words of praise bestowed upon it were not at all an exaggeration. That deliverance has powerfully affected the course of the debate, and has influenced a large number of votes. Undoubtedly it has also appealed strongly to the outside public. I am, therefore, sorry to be obliged to say that I intend to support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Bland, because I pledged myself to my constituents to vote foi: a white Australia, and, if I remember rightly, the Prime Minister, in his declaration at Maitland, also advocated the same policy. </para>

        <para>Personally, he was strongly in favour of an absolutely ' ' white " Australia, but as a question of Imperial expediency it was doubtful whether it would be wise to attempt to pass such a measure-through. The Government had no sympathy with the immigration of aliens, but desired to pass some legislation on the subject, and was proposing a measure which they confidently expected would become law. It was of no use proposing a Bill which would perhaps be vetoed by the Imperial Government. That would lead to a great waste of time ; and could they expect to receive what the Home Government had refused to Canada ? The Government was entirely in favour of a white Australia, and would go as far as it possibly could to obtain it. </para>

            <para>- Because a Bill imposing an educational test has been vetoed elsewhere, I do not see that we should go straight away from our desire to pass legislation of a certain character, and introduce another form of educational test. It would be far wiser to adopt an absolutely straight course. I would further point out that under this Bill we do not exclude all Japanese. The fact of a Japanese becoming educated does not make him a European. The Indian Baboos, who are so frequently referred to by Rudyard Kipling, quickly acquire a sufficient education to allow them to take positions in the civil service there. </para>

        <para>The Japanese think that,by reason of their importance as a nation, they should be placed upon an equality with European nations ; and for this reason they are prepared to accept the educational test provided in the draft Bill, which is on the basis of examination in England, because this does place them on the same footing as Europeans, excepting Great Britain; whereas a test in any European language would place them at a disadvantage. </para>

          <para>- I did not take part in the second reading debate, as I knew that it was not intended to challenge the second reading, and I did not desire to prolong the discussion at that stage. As this question is, however, probably one of the most important that is likely to come under our notice, I should like to say a few words regarding this clause. I think it is very unfortunate that the honorable member for Corio should have thought it necessary to speak about the consequences which might ensue if the British Government did something that they have never indicated their intention of doing. Surely we need not shake our little fist at the Imperial Government before we have any cause to do so, and we need not be afraid to deal with this matter on its merits. </para>

            <para>- It is my ambition, as I believe it is the ambition of every member of this House to see Australia become the home of a free people, the- home of a people who will enjoy equal rights and privileges. I hope that every person subject to the laws of the Commonwealth will have a voice in creating those laws, but we can never hope to reach that high ideal if we permit to settle amongst us alien races or undesirable persons who are not prepared to rise to our standard of living, and upon whom we should hesitate to confer the franchise. I think we are all unanimous as to what should be our future policy in regard to keeping Australia for a people fashioned after the Anglo-Saxon type, but there is a great difference of opinion as to the best means of attaining that object. I admit that my own feelings and predilections would be in favour of adopting the straight course suggested by the honorable member for Bland and the honorable member for Wentworth. If we only had our own interests to consult I would not hesitate for one moment in deciding, between that proposal and the course suggested by the Government, but we must remember that there are other considerations which should weigh with us. When we are passing legislation which affects other nations as well as our own, surely it is necessary for us to consider the feelings and susceptibilities of those people, more especially when they belong to friendly nations, such, for instance, as Japan. Whilst we admit that the Japanese cannot blend successfully with our own people, and that, perhaps, of all others, it would be most undesirable to allow them to settle amongst us - because if they got a footing it would ultimately become a question of the supremacy of one or the other of two nationalities - we must, nevertheless, admit their intelligence and industry, qualities which are operating to rapidly bring them into line with some of the leading nations of the earth. Then, again, we surely must consider the wishes of the Imperial Government - of that great Empire with which we have been so long allied. Whilst I admit that the advantages resulting from our union with the Empire have been mutual, and whilst I believe that in the future the preponderance of benefit may rest with the mother country, I think that up to the present time we have had by far the best of that connexion - that by far the greatest advantages have accrued to us. In the first place, regarding our trade relations, we could only offer them a market of 4,000,000 of people, whilst they could offer us a market of 40,000,000. But far greater than that consideration has been the advantage accruing to us from the- protection afforded to us as a young and rising community. If we look at our' past history and remember that up to the present time we have enjoyed - what perhaps few nations on earth have ever enjoyed - such a long- term of profound and blissful peace, and at so little cost to ourselves, and that up to the present time not a single foreign invader has set foot on our shores, we must know that that great advantage has been due to our connexion with the mother country. No one will imagine for a moment that the great military powers of the earth were deterred from attacking us because of any inherent strength, that we possessed for self-defence. In this connexion I think that a great many honorable members over-estimate our present strength for defence purposes, and that they draw a very false comparison between our conditions and those of the Boers in South Africa. We must remember that the Boers occupy a territory which can only be reached after traversing hundreds and hundreds of miles from the sea-board, whilst we have all our capitals situated on the sea-board in positions where they can easily be shelled from the ocean. Our position, therefore, is very different f from that of the Boers, who have made such a stout resistance to one of the greatest military powers in the world, and honorable members are very much mistaken if they think that we should stand in any similar relation to an attacking force. One can imagine the position of the honorable the Minister for Defence with all his volunteers away up the country climbing gum trees to catch opossums for food whilst the enemy was in possession of all our capital cities. We should not close our eyes to the fact that our immunity from attack has been due to the fact that the British Empire has been behind us, and that any country contemplating an invasion of our territory would have to reckon with the British navy before they could get at us. While I refer to these matters I think it is really unnecessary to do so, because I believe that patriotism and loyalty and the ties of kinship alone are sufficiently strong to induce us to work in harmony with the British Empire as long as we can do so without abandoning our own rights. Although this is an extremely difficult question, I believe it can be successfully dealt with either in the way proposed by the Government or by a. modification of their proposal. I can see myself some difficulty in the way of making the passing of a test in the English language the standard for admission, because it may be possible that, after a time, the people affected will make themselves familiar with it. They might educate themselves in. English in order to pass that test. Of course, we can amend our laws, but I think the Government might modify somewhat their present proposal. I understand that my honorable friend is prepared to alter the amendment, of which he has already given notice, in order to provide that the test shall be an examination in a passage of the English language, or some language to be prescribed by the Governor in Council. </para>

I do not think that the Japanese so strongly desire to be permitted to come into Australia, but, naturally, they would not like to be branded before the whole world as a people who are to be specially excluded. It is for these reasons, and for these alone, that I would adopt what I admit is repugnant to my own feelings, and bring about what we propose to do, and are determined to do, by what may be truthfully regarded as a side-wind. There is no doubt whatever that we are not saying all we mean in this Bill - that we mean a great deal more than we say. In other words, we do not intend to apply the test all round ; we only intend to apply it where it is necessary. </para>

            <para>- Of course we cannot imagine that our legislation will be agreeable to Japan, but there is a great deal of difference between causing some friction and placing an insult upon them which they may consider it their duty to resent in a way which we certainly do not wish to bring about. </para>

At the same time we should attain our object in a way which will cause the least embarrassment to the mother country by giving the least offence to those great nations whose peoples are intended to be excluded.

          <para>- I confess that I feel a good deal of difficulty about this question. I do not go so far as to say that those who prefer the indirect course are less sincere than we are. It is only a question of method, and I am very anxious not to vote against a Government I support upon such a question. I may say frankly that although I think the method is wrong - and the more I think of it the more I am convinced it is distinctly wrong - if the Government will state publicly through the Prime Minister that they make this a vital question, I shall not feel free to vote against them in the matter. But until the Government actually state in public, so that the responsibility will fall on themselves, that they make this a vital question, I shall feel free to vote according to my inclination. </para>

I want to explain to the committee why it is I feel that a question of method is of such great importance. The whole question is : Are we to say what we want, or are we to say what we do not want ? We do not want education in the sense that we will not admit people because they cannot read or write, and we do want a " white Australia." Why not say so? If it be true that the other course will lead to friction and make us hated, I prefer to be hated rather than have contempt with hatred. I prefer to state outright that we do not want yellow and black faces in Australia. </para>

In starting what is called our "national life" - that is the expression used, although I do not at all agree with it - and considering that last year the British Parliament expressly gave us a power to legislate as to any races which we might think fit to make laws about, we must assume that. the British Parliament did not mean to leave that power helpless and useless on our hands. </para>

We are given power to make laws in regard to the people of any race, other than the aboriginals of any State, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws. It is a very great power, and we ought to be grateful to the Parliament of Great Britain for giving us this large measure of confidence. 1 am not going to assume that the British Parliament did not mean to repose that confidence in us. The argument on the other side suggests a boy who is given a gun as a present, and told that he must not use it. We are given this particular power to deal, in the way of legislation, with any particular race, and then we are to be told - " Oh, no, you must not legislate in regard to any race ; you can only legislate in regard to a man's education." </para>

            <para>- With all respect, I do hot think it can be said that Japan is overcrowded. As a matter of fact Japan looks forward within the next few years to a great struggle in which she will need all the men she can get hold of. Japan has no desire to lose her population. At present the number of Japanese who come here is very small. Therefore it is much easier for us, without offence, to legislate now. It is much easier to dam back the waters before they become a flood. When once the flood sets in with the awakening of the East it will be almost impossible to stop it without giving offence. I think the easiest way would be to interfere now. Up to the present time the Imperial authorities have no authentic expression of opinion from Australia that we want this continent for the white people. I wish to place upon record the distinct and almost unanimous expression of opinion that Australia must he kept for the white races. </para>

            <para>- It is one thing to refuse New South Wales, and another thing to refuse Australia, when the desire of Australia is voiced by the Federal Parliament. I think we ought to have some means of giving an authentic expression of our views as to what we really want. If, after we have done that, we get a representation from the Home Government which is beyond cavil and doubt, that it will be impossible for the Home Government to preserve its relations with friendly nations if we pass this Bill in the form proposed by the honorable member for Bland, then I admit we should hesitate before insisting upon such legislation. I believe it is our business not to do anything which would render the position of the Home Government difficult. The Attorney-General says that the Imperial authorities will, if we persist in this course, allow us like spoiled children to have our way. I do not think that is a very happy analogy.

            <para>- I do not think the acting leader of the Opposition has ever treated this matter as a party question. A gross injustice was done to the honorable member the other day when certain motives were imputed to him with regard to his deliverance on this question. I am assured that the honorable member is as loyal to the British Crown as any one else, and that there was no ground for the attack made upon him. It is urged that by this legislation we shall offend Japan, but I would ask if we have offended China by our restrictive legislation? China has been a friendly nation, and Britain forced herself into China with the opium trade. There was a much stronger case for allowing the Chinese in here than there is for admitting the Japanese. America forced herself on Japan and Britain did not. There has been no sign of our having offended the Chinese, and I do not think we need apprehend giving any offence to the Japanese. It would be infinitely better to frankly exclude them, and to couple with that the complimentary reasons used by the Attorney-General. Let us say to them - " You have all these virtues, but we do not want them. We prefer to remain in our own vicious way of good living." </para>

The proposal of this language test lands the Government in a very peculiar position. As the Bill stands the English language is essential. That has aroused the ire of Germans, Scandinavians, and of Europeans who are as fully civilized as ourselves. Then the Prime Minister said that he was willing to accept an amendment allowing any European language to be selected by the proposed immigrant. </para>

          <para>The Japanese think that by reason of their importance as a nation they should be placed upon an equality with European nations, and for this reason they are prepared to accept the educational test provided in the draft Bill, that is, on the basis of an examination in English, because this does place them on the same footing as Europeans excepting Great Britain, whereas the test in any European language would place them at a disadvantage. </para>

            <para>- That is the point. It will be a most unsatisfactory state of affairs for ship-owners, if they do not know what test will be imposed on the immigrants coming here. It is far better that shipowners should be told distinctly who are to be excluded, and who are not. It will be most unsatisfactory for a man to have a ship-load of desirable persons coming from Europe, or elsewhere, and not to be certain that when they get to Australia they will be admitted. In conclusion, I feel that if we are bold we are safe. If we are unanimous, we will carry our way with the least friction. What I feel in my inmost heart is, that if only the Government have the courage of their opinions - if they only grasp this nettle boldly - we shall have no difficulty. At the same time, I wish to say that I do not like changes of Government, and I do not think I should be justified in giving my vote against the judgment of men better than myself upon a mere question of method. If the Prime Minister adheres to his statement that he intends to make this a vital question for the Government, I do not think I would be justified in throwing the country into confusion. </para>

            <para>- I have a grievance which I want to ventilate. I understood the Prime Minister to say last week that he would take a division on the Immigration Restriction Bill this week. Subsequently he gave it to be understood privately that no division would be taken this week on clause 4. Acting on the public statement made by the right honorable gentleman last week, I did not keep a very important engagement which I had in the country. I was desirous of voting on clause 4, and I intended to vote with the Government, but I was afraid that the division might take place during my absence, and therefore I broke my engagement. If the Prime Minister had told the House that no division would take place this week, this would not have happened. When the right honorable gentleman makes a statement to the House, that statement should be kept. Of course it is quite possible that a division would have taken place this week on clause 4 if it had not been for some-- </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that, but they ought to be able to' make some suggestion whereby the committee of the other place could join with them in economizing the public money. Another matter in regard to which I am not at all pleased is the way in which the time for private members' business has been absorbed by the Government. The Government is returning to Tuesday sittings, and we shall have to meet on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays ; but we are told that private members will not have a chance of bringing on their business until the end of the session. When the motion was being discussed one honorable member was very liberal in regard to the giving up of the time for private members' business. He remarked, "Oh, give it to them," reminding me of the American humourist who proposed to send his mother-in-law to the front when a sacrifice was required from the family. He was ready to give away the time allotted for private members' business because he did not require it himself. I have an important motion listed for discussion, and should like to have an opportunity of proceeding with it. I do not think it was right for any honorable member to get up in that unauthorized way, and practically suggest to the Government that we should be deprived of the opportunity of discussing this motion. The Prime Minister may well look into these matters. He will find that there is a great waste of money in regard to the printing of these documents ; while, in regard to the second complaint, I think he might make some arrangement by which private members who have motions on the notice-paper will have an opportunity of discussing them some time before Christmas. </para>

            <para>. - With regard to the complaint made by the honorable member for Wannon, I am quite pure that he will not accuse me of any intentional misleading of the House. I have endeavoured at all times to give the fullest information as to the course of Government business. With regard to the passage of the Immigration Restriction Bill, he will remember that I have at all times mentioned to the House that measures such as the Customs Bill and others in relation to the customs and excise demanded a great deal of attention, because, first, the Customs Bill must undoubtedly be passed into law before the Tariff is introduced, and next it is a question whether some of these other measures must not also be passed into law. Subject to these necessities, I was willing and anxious to press on with the Immigration Restriction Bill, as I have always endeavoured to do. But, as the honorable member knows, we lost a day by the adjournment on Wednesday. The most rigid parliamentarian -will not accuse me of being at fault in regard to that adjournment. It was not I who fired the shot that caused the death of President McKinley. Next we lost a great deal of time over the prolonged discussion upon the Distillation Bill, carried on by private members and not largely contributed to by the Government. Both these matters put back the Immigration Restriction Bill, and how can I be held to blame? I went as far as I could, but it was impossible to get this Bill into discussion again until this afternoon. I have made no private arrangement, and I have said or done nothing that I am not willing to account for to the House. I have not done anything behind the back of the House. I would say this : That we intend to go on with this Bill on Wednesday, and continue with it till a division is taken. That, I hope, if not on Wednesday, will be no later than Thursday afternoon next. It will conduce very much to expediting the business of Parliament if the division is not postponed beyond that day. If my honorable friend will speak to me privately upon the subject, I can show him, I think, that my endeavour has been to act in perfect good faith to all honorable members. </para>

That was announced last night, so that if the honorable member had wished to go away to-day he could have done so. </para>

              <para>-I am sorry it was too late. As to next week, I have already made my statement. With regard to the complaint of the honorable member for Coolgardie, if he asks for a return as to the cost of printing, I shall be happy to consent to it ; but I may inform him that the matter is one as to which I must refer to the Treasurer, in connexion with whose department the printing is done. If there is any unnecessary publication of parliamentary papers, that can be reduced by a private consultation between the President and the Speaker, who, I am quite sure, are ready to prevent any unnecessary expense, as experience has already convinced me. For my own part, I cannot see any necessity - inasmuch as we provide for an interchange of parliamentary papers between the two Houses - where a paper is ordered by one House to be printed, for the same paper to be ordered to be printed by the other House. If that is being done I do not see any necessity for it. It can only be a stilted view of dignity that requires anything of that kind to be done, inasmuch as the papers are already distributed among honorable members of both Houses. As to private business, what I have to say is that while the exigencies of public business require that time should be taken in regard to a matter which must overtop all abstract motions, still that will not prevent me from making every effort I can make to get as much private business dealt With as possible before the end of the session. When the pressure is relaxed that must arise in connexion with the public business of this first Australian Parliament, I shall endeavour to make some provision for the transaction of private business. I can say nothing fairer than that. As to the other matter raised by the honorable member for Kennedy, L do not think there is any paper that I shall require to have printed for the use of honorable members during the debate. </para>

That order must be given effect to. If similar papers have been laid before the Senate and the Senate has ordered them to be printed, that order also must be given effect to. But such duplication the President and I have tried to avoid as much as possible. I think it can best be avoided by leaving the matter of the printing of papers in the hands of the Printing Committees of the Houses. </para>
