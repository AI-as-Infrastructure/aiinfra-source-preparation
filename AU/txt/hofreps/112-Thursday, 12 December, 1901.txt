                    <para>- These alterations are something more than verbal amendments. The Bill as passed by this Chamber provided that Pacific Islanders whose agreements had expired, and who were found in the Commonwealth after a certain date, might be sent back to the places from which they were originally taken. Under the provision as altered, however, whilst the islanders may be expelled from the Commonwealth, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to return them to the islands from which they came. No doubt it will be of some advantage to the Government to be able to simply deport these labourers, but it would be a little more humane to return them to their homes. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not, but the same spirit of justice ought to prevail in one case as in the other, and what we should object to where our own men are involved we should not permit to be done in regard to these islanders. The Parliament that is dead to all considerations of right and wrong is not fit to legislate for the people of Australia, and if we do injustice in a case of this kind Nemesis will surely pursue us. A nation has to pay for its wrong-doing in just the same way as has the individual. I protest against an alteration of such importance being treated in this flippant way. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to remove any fear which may exist in the minds of honorable members that the amendment involves anything in the nature of cruelty to the kanakas. The effect of the amendment is that the validity of the clause - that is to say the action within its rights by the Commonwealth - is made clear beyond all doubt or cavil. Its humanitarian effect is that provision is made for cases in which it would be a very gross cruelty to return a kanaka to the island from which he came. Take, for example, the case of a kanaka who has broken a tribal law by marrying a native of some other island. It would be his death warrant to return him to the place from whence he came. Therefore opportunities must be given for that kind of deportation which will place him in the least risk. Again, under clause 8, the Pacific Islander need not be brought before the court if it is seen that there is no deportation possible which would not involve, perhaps, the destruction , of his life. It is for this reason that an officer authorized in that behalf " may " bring before the court of summary jurisdiction a Pacific Island labourer found in Australia before the 31st December, 19.06. The word "may" . has been used in order that if there should happen to be any special case in which it would be tantamount , to killing a man to deport him to a particular island, an opportunity shall be given the officer to await instructions from his Ministerial head. </para>

                    <para>- If I thought there was any possibility of the amendment affecting the treatment to be meted out to Pacific Islanders, except for the better, I should join in the protest of the honorable and learned member for Werriwa. But I am afraid that he used very ill-considered words when he said this House was wanting in feelings of humanity and justice. If the original words of the clause had been retained, and a mistake had occurred, it is true that there would have been a slight legal remedy. But if a mistake is made under the provision as it now stands, will there not be an equal remedy ? If the administration is wrongly conducted a remedy -still exists, gust as much as if the original words had been retained. </para>

                    <para>-I think there is a great deal in the protest of the honorable and learned member for Werriwa.. Under the original [agreement made between the kanakas and the Queensland Government, it was provided that the islanders at the end of three years should be returned, if they so desired, to the places from whence they came. But the desire to get rid of the kanaka at any cost seems to be dominant in this Chamber. Apparently it would not matter if he were taken out beyond the three-mile radius, and dropped overboard. The Bill, in its original form, was very much better than it is , as amended by the Senate. I trust that the amendment will not be accepted. At any rate, let us treat the islanders with some leniency, and either return them to their native places, or to some other island which they may select. </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry to differ from the honorable member for Oxley. I think that he is entirely wrong in imagining that the amendment will do an injustice to the Polynesians. Knowing the honorable member as I do, I am satisfied that he has not examined this matter very carefully, otherwise he would not have given utterance to the sentiments which he has expressed. If the amendment were intended to provide for the deportation of the kanakas, not , to the islands : to which they desired to go, but to some other place, there would be something in the contention of the honorable member. But this amendment under proper administration wjll allow of the kanaka being returned either to his own island, or if it is feared that he will lose his. life by being deported there, to some other island. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the opposition to the amendment of the Senate proceeds from an assumption that the authorities will have neither sense nor humanity. As far as I can see, the amendment simply gives a discretion - and a proper discretion - to the executive authorities to deport the kanaka to any place which they may think fit. Are we to assume that there is ever going to be an executive 'authority in Australia which will administer this measure in other than a spirit of humanity and justice? The honorable member for Oxley seems to imagine that this House has an inveterate hatred of the kanaka. To me, it appears that the spirit underlying this Bill is owe of protection to the white population of Australia, but it is not one of antagonism or hatred towards the Polynesians in any way. It is quite impossible to imagine that this law will be administered other than in a spirit of justice and humanity. The honorable and learned member for Werriwa entertains a fear that a Government, out of mere caprice, may send a kanaka to his doom. I think that the amendment is intended to arm the authorities with a discretion to deport the kanaka to the place from whence he caine, or, in the event of that course being dangerous, to send him to some other place where his life will be spared. Is my honorable friend afraid that some authority is going to rise up in Australia and act in a spirit of caprice or of hatred towards the kanaka? To imagine such a thing is not only to show a want of faith in the authorities, but also in that spirit of justice and humanity which has always characterized the British people. I do not say that the amendment could not have been framed in more definite terms, but, as it stands, I am certain that it is not likely to be administered in any spirit of harshness towards the kanaka. </para>

                    <para>- I am inclined to think that the amendment really constitutes an improvement upon the Bill, because it may happen that an island from which one of these kanakas came has virtually become depopulated. We know that many of these Polynesians have been in Queensland for a number of years, and it is 'possible that a decision may be arrived at to deport these very men. In that case it would be unwise to send them to islands which contain only a few people. Therefore, it should be in the discretion of those who administer the law to determine to what islands they shall be sent. Personally, I should have preferred that the choice of the island to which the kanaka shall be deported should have been left to himself. If it were possible I would like that done even now, but I do not see any great objection in the amendment made 'by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it. I always recognise the democrats of this Chamber as occupying the first position. I thought that whatever comedy might be allowed in Parliament would be confined to a large extent to this Chamber. But a comedy has been enacted elsewhere with regard to this Bill, which places our venerable friends in a position equal to ourselves in that respect. The only item which, in my opinion, requires consideration is that omitting the second schedule. I am not at all sure that this House was not right in repealing the local Acts. Nothing seems to me more improper or disastrous to administration than having various Acts which may clash. I am not speaking now as a lawyer, but as a layman, when I say that if this Bill supersedes the State Acts, it is all the more necessary that the latter should be repealed. We do not want to create interminable friction with people coming into Australia. These local Acts were passed under local conditions, and with certain discordant sentiments which it is the purpose of Commonwealth legislation to destroy. I should like to hear some honorable members of the legal profession on this particular clause. In this Bill we make a comprehensive law for all Australia, and it seems a contradiction in terms to allow State Acts of the same character to stand. I do not know whether these State Acts include any legislation affecting the Chinese poll-tax, or deal only with alien restriction. I know that section 109 of the Constitution provides - </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for Wentworth in his point. I do not think it is a correct method of legislating to repeal, simply by implication, Acts of the States, or to leave the latter to operate concurrently with those of the Commonwealth. The point was raised fairly early in the session, either by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo or the honorable and learned member for Indi, whether the Commonwealth Parliament has power to expressly repeal Acts of the States. Apparently the Government considered they had that power, because in Bills which were subsequently introduced there were special provisions repealing Acts of the States. In that the Government acted wisely, because it at once asserts the paramount powers of the Commonwealth, and does not leave the possibility of legal interpretation as to whether, by implication, certain Acts, which have not been expressly repealed, are retained. If we do not repeal the Acts, a question of fact and law arises whether there is any clashing between the terms of the local and the federal statutes. But when we expressly state that local Acts . are no longer in force, it is as clear as daylight that we are not relying on the State legislative machinery, as well as our own, in order to accomplish the object of the Federal Act. I think it is a mistaken principle to rely on the aid of the States, through their legislation as a sort of drag-net, leaving their Acts in force in order to cover any possible imperfections in Federal legislation. We should legislate clearly and comprehensively, and repeal at once all State Acts which may be inconsistent with our Acts. As a matter of principle we ought to assert at the outset our power to repeal, and thus enable the right to become a matter of judicial decision afterwards. In some cases I can quite understand the wisdom of not expressly repealing State Acts, because for some purposes it may be necessary to keep the latter in force. The Federal Legislature may deal with only a portion of the policy of State Acts, and consequently we have in some cases provided that to the extent of the inconsistency only are the local Acts repealed. We have done that in connexion, I believe, with the Post-office Act and other Acts. Some provisions may be necessary for local purposes, and other provisions may be similar in policy to the policy of the State Legislature ; and if Acts are repealed the fact ought to be expressly stated. According to the Prime Minister no difficulties of the kind will arise here, because he is assured that the local legislation does not in any way clash with the Commonwealth legislation. </para>

                        <para>- That is what will occur if we do not expressly repeal the State Acts. If in the administration of the local statutes anything is done which clashes with federal legislation, the action taken can be challenged in a court of justice. It is ridiculous to leave a question of the kind to be settled by judicial decision, when we have express power to achieve uniformity by repealing State Acts. The Prime Minister says there is no necessity for repeal, because the legislation is practically identical, and there is no possibility of clashing. If that be so, why leave the State Acts, except because of the fear that our federal legislation may not be sufficiently comprehensive or clear? That is a very false principle, and we ought at once to assert our rights to not' only legislate on these matters, but to repeal all State legislation so that the question may be thus raised and be settled at the start. </para>

                        <para>- First of all I think the question does not arise here. There can be no doubt about the implied repeal in this case, and even if the question did arise, we should in no way be sacrificing our power, privileges, or rights by accepting the amendment of the Senate. It is far more important to get this measure passed by the two Houses, and to obtain the Royal assent, than to raise the question as to the propriety of putting certain Acts in the schedule. Interesting as the subject is, this is hardly the time or occasion on which to raise the question. My own personal opinion is that it is very doubtful whether we can repeal State Acts expressly, and I have my doubts as to whether the schedule would carry us any further. As I say, even if the question did arise in the present case, it would be undesirable to raise a point of the kind, which is a mere matter of form as compared with the importance of the substance. </para>

                    <para>- The point which is -now being discussed was raised in connexion with the Post and Telegraph BUI, .and the Defence Bill. I remember contending at the time .that this Parliament has no power to expressly repeal State laws, and that we have to rely upon the principle -of inconsistency and repugnancy. The matter was, to a certain extent, compromised in the Postal Bill toy inserting the words "The following Acts shall not apply." Those were words of vague signification, and certainly did not amount to an express repeal. I am still of opinion that there is no power in this Parliament to expressly repeal, but that we are limited .by the provision of the Constitution, that where the law of a State is inconsistent with, or .repugnant to, a law of the Commonwealth, -the Commonwealth law shall prevail. Therefore, I hope that the committee will not assent to the (proposition which has been made. I consider that there is no justification for the contention of the acting leader of the Opposition that the amendments of the Senate in this respect should not be accepted. </para>

                    <para>- I take it that the words which have been struck out by the Senate were agreed to by this House after full consideration . A discussion took place here in regard to the original provision in the Bill, and I see no reason why we should now depart from our first decision merely to prevent a little trouble. One of our reasons for legislating upon this matter was that it was a subject with which tine States could not adequately deal, legislating independently ; and if the Bill has been properly drawn - and I think it has - it substitutes for the varying laws of the States one uniform Commonwealth law. The aim of a Parliament should be to make laws as few .and as simple as possible. One would think, however, that we were trying to create work for lawyers, because it is proposed to leave in existence the laws of six States, and to add to them a Commonwealth law. But let us try to forget that there is a legal Ministry at the head of affairs, and to remember that the great bulk of the people outside are not interested in the creation of lawyer's discussions. If I were to speak as a lawyer, I should say the more laws the merrier, because the more laws, the more work for the lawyers ; but laymen- are interested in having as few laws as possible. </para>

                        <para>- If we make it necessary to obtain certain statistical information of this kind, we must create machinery for espionage and interference. It seems to me that our object should be to obtain a certain result without unnecessary friction or interference. Surely the provision of the Senate creates interference that is not necessary, and piles up a lot of unnecessary statistical work. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the committee will speedily dispose of this question. It is absolutely clear that it would be impossible for this law to apply in Victoria, South Australia, and Queensland, where similar legislation does not exist, and not to apply in Tasmania, New South Wales, and Western Australia where similar legislation does exist. As a Commonwealth law it can be valid only' by its general application, and that consideration is enough to show that if it is to operate there is an implied repeal of all State legislation upon the same subject. It has been said that we are dealing with the laws of six States, but that is a mistake, since there is no such provision as that which we are now passing on the statute-books of Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia, while there is such a provision in New South Wales, Western Australia, and Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- A form of drafting was adopted in connexion with our earlier Bills which, perhaps, possesses some virtues of safety. But the present Bill covers the entire ground covered by the existing State laws on the subject, and more. If it did not cover the entire ground, and made less provision than a State law, then by so much as it did not operate there might be some sense in providing for the repeal of the 'State law. But as it covers the whole ground, there is no necessity under the Constitution to repeal the State law. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the honorable member to take whichever seems the more reasonable to him. The repeal clause was put into the Bill to make it conform with other Bills where a repeal clause was thought to be necessary. But that does not take from the argument that if this Bill covers the whole ground of the State legislation, there is no need under the Constitution for a repeal clause. I am so anxious for the efficiency of this legislation that the honorable member may be sure that if I thought there is the slightest danger of lessening its efficiency by omitting a repeal clause, I would dissent from the amendment of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- Difficulties and complications would have arisen, I admit, without that section in the Constitution, but its object is that where there is a conflict between a Commonwealth law and State legislation, or where it appears that the Commonwealth law within the powers granted is intended to supersede the State law the question is avoided as to which law is to prevail. But, on the other hand, where there is some little doubt and dispute is in this direction - that there is in the Constitution no express power given to repeal a State law. There is power given to pass laws inconsistent with State laws, but it is a point much mooted amongst lawyers as to whether in the absence of an express power to repeal we can exercise a repealing power. Therefore, our safest course is, as far as we can, to cover all the ground of existing State legislation, and to give an application to our law far beyond that of the State legislation, which we must, if we want to make it uniform throughout the Commonwealth. When we have done that, as in this case, then all the State Acts disappear and we are not helped by passing a repealing clause while there remains some doubt as to the power to repeal. I admit that the question of the power to repeal will have to be hereafter settled by a court of justice. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing to the fact that South Australia has on her statute-book an Act, which has never been repealed, for restricting the immigration of Indian labourers into its northern territory, and which undoubtedly will be affected by this measure. There .are other instances throughout the States where similar Acts or Acts dealing with the restriction of immigration would remain on the statute-books. If it is admitted that we have not the right to repeal such Acts, and that the moment this Bill is passed, each State is deprived of the opportunity to alter or repeal its laws, we shall have a Commonwealth law, and several State laws involving a tremendous lot of annoyance, complication, and expense, and no owner of a steam-ship or sailing vessel will be able to know what is the law as to the restriction of immigration without referring first to the Commonwealth law, and then to the various State laws, on the subject. But if we in this Bill repeal the State laws, any one can find out what the law is by looking at the Commonwealth Act. </para>

                        <para>- On that point it does seem strange to me that an important Bill, which has exercised the best efforts of our draftsmen, should have been introduced and passed with a provision for the repeal of State laws, and that only at the eleventh hour - when I may be excused for thinking that it has been discovered with a desire to get the Bill put through at any hazard before the Christmas adjournment - it should be discovered that we have no power of repeal. I take it that the constitutional provision which withdraws from the State the right to repeal its laws gives, by inference, to the Federal Parliament the power to repeal State laws which interfere with its legislation on the subject. </para>

                    <para>. - May I point out that, as a matter of fact acceptance of the Senate's amendment is necessitated by the amendment made, in this House in the Bill as originally introduced. When the measure was brought in there was not the least doubt, as my right honorable colleague has pointed out, that this measure did actually and wholly repeal the State Acts which were then included in the schedule. It was at that time thought that it might be a matter of convenience, from the point of view of public information, to indicate in the schedule what State Acts were repealed. But while the measure was dealt with in this House a very important clause was added on the motion of the honorable member for Bland, providing for the prohibition of the introduction of labourers under contract. When the Bill was discussed in another place, it was pointed out that this provision clashed with an Act in force in Western Australia, providing for the introduction of contract labourers under certain conditions. That is an Act under which certain contracts are in progress. It was then discovered that there was a dilemma. Another place either had to include the Western Australian Act in the schedule, with the possibility that by so doing they would be defeating existing contracts, or, if they omitted that Act from the schedule, they were raising a doubt as to whether Acts remained in force if not specifically repealed, by an Act which purported to repeal some Acts of a similar character. Another place was confronted with that difficulty, and also with a reminiscence of the Act to which the honorable member for South Australia has called attention. What the Senate determined was that - even apart from the point raised by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, and well discussed by him - when they realized how difficult it was to make the position clear in regard to the Western Australia Act and the South Australia Act, they shrank from the task of discriminating, and determined to strike out both the clause and the schedule. That amendment we propose to accept. Honorable members will recollect that the only object for stating in' the schedule what State Acts are repealed is to afford information to the public, and to convey a warning. But by inserting these Acts in the schedule we run this risk - that unless we are absolutely sure that we have not omitted anything that should have been included, and have not included anything that should have been omitted, we mislead those who may turn to the schedule for information. They would rely upon our statute which stated that certain. Acts were repealed, and if, as a matter of fact, those Acts did not come within the scope of our power, and were not legally repealed, the mere formal enumeration in our schedule would not repeal them. It was in view of these various difficulties, that the Senate determined that we, as a Commonwealth, had nothing to lose, and the citizens of the Commonwealth had nothing to lose, by not including these Acts in the schedule, since whatever is legally repealed by the passage of this measure will be repealed without it. We cannot add to those repeals by the schedule, and if we do not mention them, we avoid all risks. We take the safer course, both for the public and the Commonwealth, by omitting them. That is the position of the matter, and I trust the committee will agree to accept the amendment. </para>

This question has not now been raised for the first time. It has been raised several times in this House in connexion with Bills, in which State Acts were involved. Especially was it raised in regard to the Post and Telegraph Bill. In that Bill there was a direct repeal clause. In the Bill as introduced, there was this provision : " State" Acts specified in the first schedule to this Act are repealed to the extent' in the said schedule indicated:" That was the provision as passed in the Senate and brought to this House ; but when it left this House it' was altered to the following form : " Every State Act specified in the first schedule shall cease to apply to the postal and telegraphic service of the Commonwealth." That is to say, we did not repeal the Postal </para>

                        <para>-I am glad that the Prime Minister has not given an opinion on the point definitely, because, apart from this Bill, important considerations will arise in connexion with the point when we come to deal with measures affecting commercial legislation. Unless we cover the whole ground contained in every principle of every one of the Acts now in force in the States, it will be seen at once how difficult it will be to achieve anything like uniform legislation on those matters. I want to draw attention to the question as to how this point will arise when we deal with other matters of legislation. I hope the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General will give the utmost consideration to the question of the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to repeal all State laws in regard to matters that are affected by Commonwealth legislation. Because I can see that, while in connection with the Bill before us it may fairly be argued that it covers the whole ground covered by the laws which are in existence in the States, that condition of things might not arise in connexion with other legislation. The whole end and aim of federation was to achieve uniform legislation upon certain important subjects, and that object would be defeated unless we had power to repeal State laws. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite possible to imagine the Commonwealth Parliament overlooking, some important matter of principle contained in a State Act ; and it seems to me that the only way in which we can achieve uniformity of legislation is by possessing or acquiring some power of repealing existing laws, so that the Commonwealth legislation will be unquestionably supreme throughout the Commonwealth. I cannot argue the question before the committee as a matter of law. I am prepared to accept the interpretation of. the law given tp' us by the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General. But I think the whole question is of such great importance, that the utmost attention: should be given to it, not merely in relation to the Bill we are now considering, but in regard to very important questions affecting commercial legislation that must be dealt with during the present Parliament. </para>

What appears to me to be another important point in connexion with this Bill is one arising under clause 10. Provision is there made that the master or owner of a ship in which a prohibited immigrant enters the Commonwealth shall be liable to a penalty of £100 for every person so entering the Commonwealth. Then it goes on to provide for the immigrants of European descent. But it appears to me that there is no court provided in the Bill for hearing such cases, and that there are no means of administering the measure in any shape or form. </para>

                        <para>- I am not trying to force the hand of the Government in the matter. It is a very delicate question, and one which ought to be adequately mooted. The very fact that Government Bills appear on the file with the provision that I recommend contained in them, shows, at all events, that they thought at one stage that it would be advisable to express in the schedule the State Acts it was intended to repeal. But what I rose more particularly to point out is that there ought to be no misapprehension as to the effect of expressly mentioning the State Acts in the schedule. To do so would not involve the whole Act if the power to repeal does not exist under the Constitution. The effect would simply be that the provision would be nugatory. </para>

                        <para>- No, because it would not contradict section 109 of the Constitution, which savs that Commonwealth legislation shall prevail when it is inconsistent with State legislation. But what it would do is that, if we have power to repeal, any one who wishes to find out what is the Commonwealth intention or law on a particular matter would only have to turn up the Federal Act to see what local Acts were repealed. But if we do not express the Acts repealed, in order to understand what the law on the point was one would have to look not only to the Federal Act, but to the State Acts, and would also have to become a judge as to the consistency or inconsistency of concurrent provisions. That is a difficult and invidious task to impose even on a lawyer, who had to advise as to what was the Australian law on the point in question. Therefore because no harm can be done by direct appeal, and because some good may be done thereby, it will I think be better to specify the local Acts which are repealed. Besides that, this is the only way in which to secure a judicial decision upon the point. The question of our competency to repeal State Acts can never be decided in a court of justice, unless we take the course I recommend. We shall always have to rely on the question of consistency or inconsistency, because until we have exercised this supposed power no court can decide on the existence of such a power. Therefore I think it is a mistake that the Minister does not insert these words to facilitate a decision on the point as to what the Commonwealth law on the subject is. </para>

                        <para>- We have on this side been endeavouring to carry out as far as possible our intention to provide for revenue without destruction. I wish to reiterate that the exception in seeking to have these items placed upon the free list is due to the fact that we feel that the people interested are in an exceptional position. There may be certain revenue duties which extend to the whole population upon articles which are fairly open for revenue purposes, but I wish to tell my right honorable friends that if we are going to have these duties fixed at the enormously high rate of duty which we passed last night, which will, in fact, amount to 30 per cent., and will, in many cases, be absolutely prohibitive, we must, in the interests of the people, try for some compensation. We have been trying, all through the debate on the Tariff, to create something like a principle. As some very clever writer in one of the papers has said, the object of the Opposition has been " to get back to Maitland." We have got back to Maitland on one or two occasions, but in some instances we have only been able to get half way, and last night we did not get even there As far as our party is concerned, we are willing to carry out that compact and vote for moderate duties, which will be revenue bearing, and may have at the same time an incidental protective effect. </para>

                        <para>- I want to have a clear understanding, because if we cannot get the people interested some substantial assistance in connexion with the rates to be levied on these articles, we must try in other revenue producing items to give them some compensation. I do not desire to pose as an authority upon these matters, and as there are many of the articles here referred to which have peculiar characteristics, history, and circumstances connected with them, I should be glad if honorable members, and especially those coming from country districts, would give the committee the benefit of their information. Apart from all prejudices of party, honorable members representing Victorian agricultural districts are intelligent men, and understand the working of such a Tariff, and I ask them to give the committee the fullest possible information as to how the people using these articles will be affected. We shall be dealing with articles now which should be free or under no protection whatever, but having passed a duty of 15 per cent, upon agricultural implements, if we can give a reasonable amount of relief to the farmers, even on the other items in this section, we may to some extent retrace our steps. I am not an authority upon mould boards, and therefore I shall not propose any amendment at the present stage. I hope that honorable members in view of the condition of those who are really developing Australia, will consider each of these items carefully and indicate how they should be dealt with. </para>

                    <para>- I have an amendment in connexion with mould boards - that straight mould board plates cut to shape, but unbent, should be admitted free. There is no desire to place in the list of exemptions mould boards which are already bent. We cannot manufacture a certain class of plates here as we have no machinery to deal with them, but if they are bent after arriving here the operation will give employment to workmen in the Commonwealth. The mould board is the part of a plough which comes behind the share and throws the mould over as the plough goes through the ground. The desire is only to admit free the mould board plates which are not exactly finished, and the bending of which would give a certain amount of employment. </para>

                    <para>- I have made inquiry in regard to the manufacture of shares, and I find that those which are made in South Australia are equal to any in the world. Therefore I am not in favour of allowing all shares to come in free. There is one special class, however, known as Hornsby's chilled-steel shares, which is largely used. A number of farmers will not use any other. In view of that fact, I move - </para>

If the honorable member desires. that the class of shares he mentions should be placed upon the free list he will have to move to that effect when we are dealing with the special exemptions. I fail to see that he can draw a herring across the trail when a straightforward vote is invited on one particular line. If my amendment is carried it will include the class of shares to which the honorable member has referred. If it is not carried, he may then move that this particular firm be particularly protected by the placing of its shares on the list of special exemptions. </para>

Not being a farmer myself, and not knowing too much about farming, I considered when the Tariff was issued that the best thing I could do would be to obtain the expert opinion of farmers upon it. My electorate includes the principal farming districts in Victoria, and I am advised by farmers that they consider locally-manufactured shares should be protected in order that farmers may be able to obtain their shares as cheaply as possible. In these days of world trusts, cheap and good shares for the formers may best be secured by placing a duty upon those imported into the Commonwealth, as proposed in the Tariff. I trust that the committee will accept the Government proposals. </para>

                    <para>- We are told by those who strongly desire that ploughshares should be placed on the free list, that they will thus be cheapened to the farmer, but it is well that we should review the actual position. We find that whilst South Australian and Victorian farmers have been paying 40s. per dozen for shares, the farmers of New South Wales have been charged 52s. per dozen for an exactly similar article. The present position is exactly the same as that which caused the Victorian farmer to support the proposal to have a duty placed on shares. </para>

That is the reason that I have selected Shearer's steel shares which are in use throughout Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia. The prices in South Australia range, according to the size of shares, from 36s. to 40s. per dozen, and the quotations are exactly the same in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- Simply because their ploughs are not in the market to any great extent, and are not used in the northern portion of New South Wales. They have sold many ploughs to farmers in southern Riverina, but owing to the system of railway freights in operation in New South Wales, it is practically impossible for the Victorian manufacturer to enter into competition with foreign goods in the northern districts of New South Wales. The Victorian, manufacturers know, moreover, that it is useless for them to attempt to compete with imported shares unless they handle the shares themselves - as distinguished from placing them ' in the hands of ordinary agents - and there is not a sufficient market to justify them in starting independent agencies. The fact remains, and cannot be disputed, that the New South Wales farmer pays more for his plough shares than does the Victorian farmer. </para>

                        <para>- Because immediately competition became keen the local importer could, by flooding the market with his surplus products, crush the local manufacturer out of existence. The manufacturer in the Commonwealth has practically no surplus,' but is engaged in supplying the legitimate local demands. On the other hand foreign manufacturers, who conduct their operations on a larger scale, very frequently send their surplus into our markets and, in order to obtain control of them, are quite prepared to sell their products for a considerable tune at the actual cost of production. As soon as they attain their object we know from personal experience that they fix such prices as will recoup them for their losses. </para>

                        <para>- The same thing might be said with regard to any of our natural products, such as butter, for instance; but we know that nothing of the kind has occurred. While there is a large market to operate upon, and sufficient scope to induce capitalists to embark in manufacturing industries, there are no opportunities for a combination; but if there were a limited market, I could understand that there would be a greater danger in that direction. We know that there have been combinations among the importers. Whilst I believe in the encouragement of the primary producer, I am a strong advocate for encouraging diversity of occupation for the people. Honorable members on the opposite side of the chamber, who are so strongly advocating what they believe to be the claims of the producer, would apparently throw the whole of the people into occupations in connexion with the primary industries, the labour engaged in which is producing for the lowest paid wage in the world. If we are going to develop our primary industries in a satisfactory manner, it is only by affording diversity of employment that we can induce a greater number of people to settle here. We should be much better off, if we had people here to develop our large waste areas. </para>

                        <para>- Order. The honorable member has no right to ask a question, except when he is standing in his place, addressing the Chamber. The standing order is perfectly clear upon the matter. The honorable member knows very well that it is a breach of the standing orders to interrupt any honorable member who is addressing the committee. I have repeatedly asked honorable members to cease from interjecting, especially in committee, where there is absolutely no justification for it, seeing that every honorable member has a right to speak for himself.

                        <para>- Of course honorable members are acquainted with the provision contained in the standing orders, but I would point out that it is " more honoured in the breach than in the observance." In all State Parliaments it is customary to allow interjections, so long as they are couched in temperate language, and are cognate to the question. If, upon the point which has arisen, it is the desire of the committee to adhere to the letter of these standing orders, honorable members should be informed of the fact at once, and the decision should be uniformly enforced. </para>

                        <para>- I was attempting to show, when the interruption occurred, why, in the interests of the farmers and of those who want to obtain their ploughshares at the lowest possible price, those implements should not be placed upon the free list. I have previously mentioned that the price of shares in Victoria and South Australia, where a protective duty had been operating for a number of years, was less than the price at which the farmers could purchase them in New South Wales and Queensland, where they were admitted free. These shares cost only 36s. to 40s. per dozen in Victoria, but when they were imported into New South Wales the importers fixed the price at which they should be sold, with the result that they realized 52s. per dozen in that State. </para>

                        <para>- I was saying that the price of Lennon's shares in New South Wales and Queensland was fixed by the importers. As a result, the importers in New South Wales have fixed the price at 52s. 6d. per dozen, whilst in Queensland they have fixed it at 65s. per dozen. This fact affords a splendid reason why we should support the proposal to continue the competition which has hitherto existed in Victoria. Some years ago, when the gangplough was protected by patent rights, and before a fac-simile of it could be manufactured in Victoria, I had occasion to use one. I bought a supply of shares for that particular class of plough, but discovered long before the plough itself was worked out that the type of share had been altered, and as a result the foot had to be altered, at the cost of the user of the implement. Such conditions cannot arise when we have a manufactory in our midst. Until it is shown that the cost of the implements which we propose to manufacture in Australia will V&gt;e enhanced to the consumer, I see no justification for including them in the free list. By so doing, we shall practically be relegating ourselves to the position which we occupied 25 years ago. Every one knows that the conditions appertaining to farming in different parts of the world vary very considerably. If an expert in agriculture comes from America to Australia, he has to commence to learn the local conditions surrounding the industry. Some of our experts, in order to succeed here, have practically had to forget a considerable amount of what they had previously learned. The same argument applies to the implements and machines which we use in Australia. The advantage of having the manufacturer of these implements in our midst is that he is continually looking ahead to the requirements of the Victorian farmer. That is why we get a stripper which takes off a crop for an expenditure of 5s. an acre. For the reasons I have given, I shall oppose the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth. </para>

                    <para>- We have been anxious to obtain from the honorable member for Moira some information with regard to the condition of the agricultural industry. That honorable member, at some considerable length, endeavoured to prove that Victorian agriculture has prospered under a system of protection, and I asked the very fair question how it was, if he were correct, that Victoria had lost one-tenth of her population during the last ten years ? </para>

                        <para>- If honorable members are anxious to populate Victoria and increase production, why is it proposed to retard the progress of agriculture by placing a heavy duty on articles which the farmer .requires, in order to enable him to produce in the most economical way ? The honorable member for Echuca has stated that he is prepared to make an exception in the case of Hornsby shares. Why should the same privilege not be extended to others who make an equally good article? It seems extraordinary that an honorable member should advocate the giving of a monopoly to one particular firm ; and the fact only shows the fallacy of the claims of protectionists. In other countries, all kinds of machinery are being invented to promote production under the most economical conditions, and as many of these machines are patented, it will be impossible for our producers to have the advantage of them if a heavy duty be imposed. These patents are protected for a number of years ; and yet we find duties advocated by honorable members who are supposed to represent agricultural constituencies.' It is made to appear that all sorts of concessions are given to agriculturists by placing duties on articles they produce, whereas these duties can be of no benefit, seeing that we are now an exporting country. I cannot understand why honorable members should underrate the importance of the pastoral industry. We are anxious that all industries should succeed, and it ill becomes honorable members to endeavour to lessen the importance of any one of them. We have great difficulties to contend with in competing for the home market. Of butter alone, England last year imported no less than £1-7,000,000 worth, and we cannot enable the farmer to export this and similar products, such as wheat and other produce, if heavy duties are placed on the articles required for the working of the farm. Had we had a full Mouse last night a different decision would have been arrived at in regard to this item ; and this shows the importance of every member being in attendance. Two members who paired against this item were in favour of a 10 per cent, duty, and counting those with whom they paired, there would have been a majority of one in favour of the views of the Opposition. That was why I protested against going to a division, feeling as I did that we were to a certain extent risking the agricultural industry. I intend to take another opportunity of testing the question, because I believe a decision was arrived at last night which was not in accord with the wishes of the majority of the people of the Commonwealth. We are told that we have to .protect the manufacturers ; but according to the returns, there are only 1,500 persons employed in making agricultural implements in the various States, out of a total of 170;000 engaged in various .manufacturing industries. The output of the dairying, agricultural, and mining industries amounts to over £80,000(000 sterling per annum, and in order to help the manufacturers - not the workmen, because wages are not always increased according to the benefit derived from a protective duty - we are going to handicap one of the main industries of the Commonwealth. I have often heard protectionists urge that attention should be given to the agricultural industry ; but I do not see how -we can help that industry by increasing the cost of the articles required by the farmer. I cannot understand how the cost of a patented article can be lessened by the imposition of a duty. The greatest difficulty -we have at the present time is that we do not obtain at the earliest possible moment, the advantages of inventions and improvements in machinery. When Minister for Mines and Agriculture in New South Wales I suggested, and my colleagues agreed with me, the sending of one of the ablest men in the department to America and other countries in order to ascertain how we in Australia stood in relation to the adoption of modern machinery, &amp;c. A few weeks ago that officer told me that improvements which lessen the cost of production are constantly being made, but that it is often two years before we in Australia get the benefit of the new implements. It is under these circumstances we have to compete with other countries at Mark Lane. We are told that the way to get over the trouble is to compel the owners of patent rights to establish manufactories in Australia. But what is the farmer in Australia to do in the meantime? Is he to be crushed out of existence ? A serious injury has been done to the producing interests by the action already taken by this committee, and I hope that honorable members will hesitate before they further hamper those interests. We have to depend on our primary producers, and we should endeavour, as far as possible, to place them in the best' position for competing in the markets of the world. I did not speak during the general discussion upon this item, because I was anxious to obtain a division before eleven o'clock last night. I knew how the farmers would fare if the division were postponed until after that hour, and the result was what I anticipated . No doubt the Government think they are justified in trying to force their Tariff through, but it is our duty to try to modify it in such a way as to help the producers. I think that the amendment before the committee should be carried, because it would be an extraordinary thing to place mould-boards upon the free list and to tax plough-shares. I have heard a great deal about the importance of assisting our manufacturers, but the divisions which have been taken afford very little evidence of a desire to assist the agriculturists. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the honorable and learned member represents a farming constituency, and so do I. But the farmers do not want to pay heavy duties. They know that the duties upon butter, cheese, honey, wheat, and other articles are of no substantial advantage to them, and are put on only as a blind to make them accept other duties. I claim to know the opinions of the farmers upon this subject pretty well, and I feel sure that if the committee place heavy duties upon agricultural implements serious injury will be done to the farming industry. The honorable member for Echuca, while he would tax ordinary plough-shares, wishes to admit the Hornsby shares free. I admit that Hornsby is a good maker, but I have yet to learn that he is the only good maker of agricultural implements. </para>

                        <para>- We have done a great deal during the 'last ten years. In 1S91 there were 840,852 acres under cultivation, exclusive of grassed lands, and in 1901 the cultivated area had increased to 2,446,000 acres. That increase of 1,600,000 acres affords good evidence that we have succeeded under a free-trade policy in developing our agricultural industry j and Victoria certainly cannot show anything like the same rate of progress during the same period. Our dairying industry has also gone forward by leaps and bounds, whilst that of Victoria has been at a standstill during the last year. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs has shown very plainly the objectionable nature of what he has called "assembling industries," for which he has provided so much support in the Tariff. I would ask honorable members to note these remarks of the Minister's when we come to deal with the large number of items which provide for the admission duty free of parts of articles which are made up here. We have already passed some of these items, such as that relating to umbrellas. With reference to the remarks upon the subject of completed ploughs and parts of ploughs, I would point out that there is nothing to prevent us from reversing the decision of last night, which was arrived at under circumstances which render it at least doubtful whether the majority of the committee were with the Government. In view of that decision, however, we have no recourse except to deal with these articles separately. If we succeed in placing them on the list of exemptions, we shall not create any anomalous situation, because it would naturally follow that ploughs would in due course also be included among the special exemptions. We can make our position perfectly logical by following up our present action, and exempting the complete machines from duty when we come to deal with the free list. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have been guilty of an act which does not reflect credit upon them. They have ' tried in every possible way to prevent reasonable encouragement being given to the farmers of the country ; but, immediately the interests of the pastoralists come under review, they are ready to give tl em very different treatment. As honorable members know, I should like all these machines to be placed upon the free list, and, failing that, I would vote for a duty of 10 per cent. But I do not see why a distinction should be made between one class of producers and another. This Tariff is teeming with exemptions in favour of the manufacturers, who already have a natural protection by reason of the high freights prevailing between this country and other parts of the world. But the farmers who have to compete in the markets of the world, and pay freights upon their produce, are put at a disadvantage by being charged heavily upon all the machinery they use. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Macquarie has had a large parliamentary experience, and I might look to him to uphold the authority of the Chair, but he is now proceeding on the same lines as when I first ruled against him. He is not in order in drawing lengthy comparisons between the treatment accorded to two classes of producers, or in reflecting upon the actions of the Government. If he wants to do that, he must seek some other occasion. </para>

                        <para>- The addresses we have been listening to may do a great deal of harm by misleading people outside, but so far as honorable members are concerned the policy of the Government and their supporters is clear and well understood. We have agreed to give a reasonable measure of protection to those who are engaged in the manufacture of commodities which can be successfully produced here, but in the case of such things as shearing machines, which are not manufactured here, we are quite consistent in placing them on the free list. I really thought that the honorable member for Macquarie knew something about farming until he spoke on this question. The principal sheep-owners are the farmers. In the back blocks of New South Wales the large holdings may be purely pastoral, but in Victoria and Tasmania and other places that are densely populated, the great bulk of the sheep are kept by the farmers, who cannot carry on their operations successfully unless they combine grazing with agriculture. Therefore there is nothing in all the talk about making a distinction between the farmer and the pastoralist. I think the Government are quite right in acting in accordance with their promise to place shearing machines and other similar articles on the free list. I should like to know whether seed drills are being manufactured here. </para>

                        <para>- As it is the object of the Opposition to have as many articles as possible placed on the free list, we are not quarrelling with the Government for agreeing to remove the duty from shearing machines, but I desire to point out the marked contrast in the conduct of the Government, when they are dealing with a matter affecting pastoralists, and when they are asked to consider something in which the farmers' interests are involved. The pastoralists who, being wealthy and influential, can impart some weight to their representations, find their requests acceded to, but the poor farmer has no hope of favorable consideration, because he is not able to meet the members of the Government at the clubs and at dinners. </para>

                            <para>- I withdraw my remarks. We find the Government bowing down and displaying obsequiousness and servility when they are dealing with the interests of wealthy men, but failing to show any consideration for the poorer classes. It is a most peculiar thing that in all cases the poorer classes of people are being called upon to bear the burdens of taxation. We know that small farmers - even though they own as many as 1,000 sheep - do not use shearing machines, and it is only the wealthier squatters who are able to take advantage of them. I happened to be surveying on the Euroka station when the Wolseley  shearing machine was first brought forward, and I saw the whole plant put up and some of the machines made there. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Werriwa speaks as if the shearing machine covers the whole of the plant erected in a machine-shearing shed, and that everything comprised in that plant is to be exempted from duty. It is not proposed, however, to exempt anything except the small machine which the shearer takes in his hands, and which is operated by motive power supplied generally from a steam engine, and communicated to the machine by means of shafts and pulleys. These machines are not made within the Commonwealth, and the combs and cutters which are practically the essential parts of the machines, and which have to be replaced sometimes as often as two or three times a day, or even more frequently, are generally supplied by the shearers. When the honorable member attempts to tell the committee that these machines are manufactured on the stations, he is talking nonsense. The shearing machines are not manufactured here, and it is only a fair thing to exempt them from duty. The Government and their supporters are not making any distinction between different classes of the community. I have already pointed out that where we find there is a sufficient field of operations to induce people to lay down plant for the manufacture of a certain article, we are prepared to impose duties with a view to affording reasonable protection, but where the demand is not sufficiently large to justify manufacturing operations within the Commonwealth, we are studying the best interests of the community by admitting the goods free. </para>

                            <para>- Some of them are selectors. The farmer is helped by having these cheap machines, and I have sent to Sydney for hundreds of them for working men. As to combs and cutters, the men have to pay for them, and I have known the cost come to 10s. per week on some men's earnings. Are these men not as entitled to a little consideration as are farmers? All the talk since the Minister for Trade and Customs gave way in this matter has arisen simply because the free-traders would not allow the opportunity for an argument to pass. </para>

If the Government gave us free-trade all through I should support them. </para>

It would just be as reasonable to call cutting a beam in two, a manufacture that ought to be protected, as to suggest that horse gear should bear a duty. This gear is used by the poorer classes of farmers who are without capital or elaborate- machinery. I beg to move - </para>

                        <para>- With regard to portable engines, traction engines, and oil engines, as they are not made here to any extent, and are largely used in the dairying and agricultural industries, I intend to propose that they be admitted free. I see no reason why they should not be made here, but it is hardly fair to make them dutiable until they are made here. What we propose is that they shall come under the provisions of Division VIa, a bonus being given to encourage their manufacture, and when the industry is established it will be a fair thing to impose a duty. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose that what is termed a "locomotive boiler " is a tubular boiler such as is commonly used in locomotives, but I would point out that there are many vertical engines up to ten and twelve horse power which are used for purposes similar to those to which the engines here described are applied. They are engines with vertical boilers, and are fixed on small frames with wheels so as to permit of their easy transport. If portable engines with boilers of a locomotive type are to be exempted from duty, there is no reason why we should not also place on the free list engines of the class I refer to, which are extensively used for chaff-cutting, dairying works, driving small mining batteries, and a variety of other purposes. I think that a mistake has been made in including the words ""fixed on a locomotive boiler horizontally." To my mind, the words " portable engines " would cover the whole thing. The object of the Government, I take it, is to exempt from duty machinery which can readily be transported from place to place. I think therefore that the words "fixed on a locomotive boiler horizontally" should be omitted. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that they are articles which cannot be manufactured locally. I have a note here of a patent machine from America called the " American Champion Steel Reversible Road-roller." That, I presume, will come under this heading. At any rate, I should like to have some information as to the category under which road-making ploughs and machines will come. These road-rollers clear, roll, and form roads, and they are also used in connexion with embankments. I desire to know whether this article includes everything connected with road-making, or whether other machines will come under the heading of " n.e.i." It seems to me that an angel from heaven will not be able to understand this Tariff if we continue in the way we are now proceeding. When we have come to the end of this division, and have finally settled the exemptions, it seems to me it will be an awful division. I pity the people who have to interpret it. In this Tariff we 'are building a monument to our own incapacity and ignorance. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if he will agree to add after the word " machines " the words " including stone-crushers, road-rollers, distributing carts, and road-making implements." What I principally object to is that we have not received a little more information from Ministers. I do not know whether the matter is worth bothering about, and I should like to hear the opinions of other members of the committee. </para>

                            <para>- It has not succeeded to the extent anticipated, but the conditions scarcely allowed of a fair test. It was heavily timbered country where the machine was tried ; but I know that, under normal conditions, earth can be moved by this machine at less than one-half the cost of the appliances previously in use. This machine will certainly revolutionize this class of work in the putting up of embankments, constructing water channels, and similar operations. </para>

                            <para>- Municipalities who use steam-rollers can better afford to pay an excess of cost, than can smaller municipalities which only require a horse-roller. There is another road-making machine imported from America, which is not made locally, but which I understand is splendidly adapted for the purpose. By its means an immense saving can be made, and as we want good roads all over Australia, we should encourage the importation of this machine at the lowest possible cost. Local manufacturers would then have an opportunity of improving upon it, so that in time, under the protective system they may, as we are told is possible, give a cheaper article than under free-trade. A remark, interjected by the honorable member for Bland, causes me to refer to the scoop largely used in road-making, and in the making of dams over all the interior. That is an article which certainly ought to be placed on the free list. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it is manufactured all over Australia, but there ought to be room for competition so that the Americans may come along with their improved inventions. I understand from the honorable member for Moira that the grader to which he referred will really revolutionize this class of work in Australia. If it does all that is claimed for it, it will enable us to make furrows as done in California, and irrigate our land inexpensively. That machine ought to be admitted free, and when our local manufacturers are able to do something better the committee may be consulted again. Such a machine would enable the land on the Murray, in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia to be irrigated with advantage, and would supply water to settlers at the minimum cost. At present the cost of water is a drawback, with the primitive system of irrigation carried on by . small farmers, who do not understand the business technically. He requires a machine which will make a furrow large enough to conduct the water, and will not become blocked or dammed as furrows made by an ordinary plough often do. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that it would be better for the committee to deal separately with the last two implements in the item - road-making ploughs and machines. Road-making ploughs are being made in Victoria to great perfection, and I have a letter from the resident engineer at Tocumwal, stating that in his opinion the Victorian road-making ploughs are far superior to the American ploughs. It is, however, impossible to make a road with a plough alone. Scoops are required, and I should like to know whether they are included under the term, road-making ploughs, or come in as machines. A scoop is an implement which any country blacksmith can make, and as we admit the raw material free, I think that there should be a duty upon them. I do not know if the machine mentioned by the honorable member for Moira is a road-making machine. </para>

                            <para>- There are other roadmaking machines, which crush and distribute the metal as they travel along. I saw two of these - an imported machine and a machine made by a firm in South Melbourne - at the last Melbourne show, and it seemed to me that the South Melbourne machine was simpler and stronger than the other.

                        <para>- Before leaving this item, I should like to bring before the committee the case of a locally-invented harvester, because I think there should be further consideration of it. I have in my hand one or two printed documents giving a good many reasons why special consideration should be allowed to these machines, but the strongest reason has been communicated to me privately, and it seems to me that it should be sufficient to cause further consideration to be given. I understand that the combined harvester is a purely Australian production, invented by Australians to meet the requirements of . Australian farmers. In December, 1879, the South Australian Government offered a prize of £4,000 for a harvester, and 29 machines competed at Gawler, but none of them was considered sufficiently effective to merit the prize. Many other experiments were made, with the result that, owing to disclosures which could not be prevented, it has been impossible to obtain a patent for the whole machine as now improved, though patents have been secured for many of the parts. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is only one horse-shoe nail factory in Great Britain, and only one in Germany, and there are only five in the United States. Machinery enters so largely into the manufacture of horse-shoe nails that a comparatively small factory can turn out a very large supply. As a matter of fact the plant and machinery in the Victorian factory - Pender's- -although it is not working at full power, is capable of turning out 175,000 horse-shoe nails in an eight hours' day, or a sufficient number for the shoeing of 2,500 horses. Messrs. Pender and Co. make their own machines, and will be prepared to supply the Commonwealth with all the nails they require, three months after the passing of this Tariff if the rate remains. Taking Nettlefold's English list, of 2nd December, 1899 - the latest I was able to obtain - I find that their nails are being sold at 4½d. per lb. in England. </para>

                            <para>- That is the price with the discount off ; and the same price is quoted for locally-manufactured nails in Victoria. If honorable members are sufficiently interested to glance at the samples which I have here, they will see at once the difference in the quality. Nettlefold's nail is very easily distinguished from the others. It is a forged nail of very fair quality, but not equal to the American or the Australian nail, for this reason, that it has a flat head- it is not countersunk. There is no nail equal to the American nail except the Australian, and Nettlefold's nail is the next best in the world. The nail that is being principally sold in Australia comes from Germany, and is a cold cut nail, not nearly equal in quality to Nettlefold's or the American or Australian nail. That and a Swedish nail, called the " Globe," are principally sold throughout Australia. In New South Wales, Messrs. Hordern and Sons are selling the "Globe" nail at 6½d. per lb., and we are supplying a forged nail in Victoria, equal to the American, at the same rate. The " Globe " nail is being sold in Queensland at from 7d. to 7½d. per lb., but in Western Australia the German nail is almost exclusively used. Therefore, briefly put, the position is this : that we are selling horse-shoe nails in Victoria at exactly the same prices, wholesale, as in Great Britain, and at1½d. per lb. less than in America. We are selling a better quality nail than is to be obtained in any other part of Australia, and at a cheaper rate. In 1894, when trade was fairly brisk, and the manufacturers were making a little money - they have nob made any money since the importers endeavoured to. drive the local manufacturers out of the market by bringing down the price of nails by 10s. per cwt. </para>

                            <para>- There is, I believe, between 20 and 30 men employed in the making of horse-shoe nails. The number, however, does not affect my argument. My desire is to give the consumer an advantage'. If it can be proved that he has derived no advantage from the manufacture of horse nails in Australia, I am willing to support a proposal to place them upon the free list. I wish also to remind the committee that if we wipe out the manufacturer there will be no proper competition. On the other hand, if we keep him in existence, he will be the means of conferring an advantage upon the consumer, and it is the consumer whom I am considering. I find that in 1900 there were 655 cwts. of horse nails imported into Victoria, whilst the local manufacture totalled 2,548 cwts. Taken together, the quantity of nails used in home consumption in this State was 3,203 cwts. At the Queensland rate of duty, namely, 3s. per cwt., £480 in revenue would have been collected, whilst under the Tasmanian rate of 2s. 6d. per cwt. the receipts from this source would have represented £400. As a fact, however, £459 was collected at the Customs. This shows that the higher rate of 14s. brought in a greater revenue ; and that the prohibition spoken of really did not exist. If revenue be the committee's aim and end, then 7s. will give more than 4s. will give. Adverting to the nail factory which has been established in Victoria, .1 may mention that £12,000 has been invested in the industry. This factory is capable of turning out 175,000 horse nails per day of eight hours. With three months' notice to prepare the plant and machinery it could manufacture enough nails to supply the yearly wants of the whole of the Commonwealth. The amount of protection which is afforded to this industry in other parts of the world is very much in excess of that which it is proposed to confer upon it here. In America the protection which is given to the industry represents ltd. per lb., in Canada it is equivalent to 1 1/2d.. per lb., whilst the Australian rate only represents f d. per lb. In Germany and France it averages 2d. per lb. I have been asked what sort of Wages are paid by "this factory. In reply I may state that one man - who. I presume is the foreman - receives £5 per week, another £4 5s., a third £3 6s., whilst four operatives get £3 each, and eight others £2 10s. each. The balance of the employes who are made up of apprentices and lads receive from 10s. to 25s. weekly. All the men working in this factory are constituents of mine, and I know that they are well satisfied with the wages they are receiving. If there were no competition between the manufacturer and the importer the profits of the latter would be very large indeed. They used to be about 100 per cent. In Sydney we find that the importer at the present time is making 70 per cent, profit upon the nails that he sells, taking the declared value of the imports at the Customs as the basis of the calculation. It may be interesting to observe how the protection afforded to this industry under the Government proposal will affect the consumer, if we admit the argument of the free-trader that the imposition of any duty correspondingly enhances the price of the article. If we take the quantity of nails required to shoe a horse, weigh them, and make a charge of 6½ per lb. upon them, we find that they will cost 1½ d. If we add the whole of the duty to the cost of the nails it will represent an extra farthing for every horse that is shod. Of course, T do not admit that that farthing is added, but if it were it would not hurt the farrier very much. He is as entitled to pay his share of the taxes as any one else. It is also interesting to notice that the iron necessary to shoe a horse costs about 9d. But the average charge in Victoria for shoeing horses is about 5s. per set, so that the blacksmith gets a fair profit, and even if he had to pay the whole of the duty he would not fare very badly. I hold another article in my hand which to a certain extent is related to nails. It is a horse rasp. Horse rasps and horse nails are inseparable in the stock-in-trade of the blacksmith. Horse rasps are not made in Australia, but nails are. I also hold in my hand an invoice which shows that a 16-inch horse rasp landed in Victoria costs1s.1d. I went to the trouble of purchasing one from a leading ironmonger in Melbourne the other day, and I paid 2s. 3d. for it ; so that the importer is making a profit of 130 per cent, upon an article which is not manufactured here, whilst he has to be content with a profit of 50 per cent, upon an article that is locally manufactured. The same price is charged throughout the shops. If we take the most favourable view we find that the Hardware Association's price for rasps is 21s. 6d. per dozen, so that the least profit under any circumstances is 60 per cent., while the consumer has to pay 130 per cent. That is how the importer treats the consumer. </para>

                        <para>- The imported nail is of the same size and answers the same purpose ; and though it may not be quite as good as the local article, still a profit of 70 per cent, is made on the sale. The honorable member has further stated that the machine in the making of nails is the chief factor. That is so, and even if the nails are made in Japan, it is not a question of cheap labour but one of machinery. One man and a boy could manufacture enough nails for the whole of' Victoria. On the honorable member's own showing there are only fifteen men and ten boys employed in the industry, and it is most likely they are also doing some other kind of work. Moreover, he affirms that the Victorian manufacturers can in three months make nails enough for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- By the time the interest is paid the rate comes to something like Id. per lb. Why should we, because a man puts a certain amount of capital into this industry, guarantee him against loss ? The farmer who has planted his crop this year may lose all from storm or drought. But he will not be guaranteed against loss. No persons in the community are guaranteed under this protectionist system except a few manufacturers to whom, at the expense of the people, the Government guarantee that they shall get their money back with something added. If honorable members opposite like to subscribe together to guarantee this manufacturer, there is no more to be said ; it is open for them to do so. What I object to is bringing in other people and saying that because we are sitting here as legislators we will compel them to pay something which they do not want to pay. If the argument put forward by honorable members opposite be a sound one, I can show them how I should be prepared to start a factory giving employment not to twenty but to 50 men. All I ask is that Parliament will grant to me the amount of money that goes into the pockets of this manufacturer. It comes to about £20,000 indirectly. I 'will take half of that, and" with the £10,000 a year, I will guarantee to employ 50 men, giving them the wages that this nail manufacturer pays. I will pay them 30s. a week, and will give them 36.5 days' holiday per annum. I will spend £7,000 upon wages, and will pocket the remaining £3,000. </para>

                            <para>- The arrangement I suggest would, according to protectionist arguments, be advantageous to the country, because instead of employing 20 men I should employ 2-j^ times that number. All the money would be kept in the country, and the men would have nothing at all to do. When I think of the prospect, I see a regular Eldorado before me. But when the protectionist arguments are stated in that way, can we not all see the utter absurdity of them and their complete lack of logic? One is absolutely astonished to hear honorable members put forward such statements. Let us put the case in another way. The one argument used by the Minister for Trade and Customs that was sound, was that this duty would be a good thing for the manufacturer. I do not deny that for one moment. In fact a duty of 2d. per lb. would be better for him, and a duty of 6d. would be better still. No free-trader has argued that it would not be a good thing for the manufacturer. What we ask is : Why should we allow a particular individual to get this benefit at the expense of the rest of the community ? What does this man do any more than any other citizen that he should be singled out and allowed to appropriate part of the people's earnings to himself. If this individual went to 75 people outside and tried to induce them to compel the public to contribute towards his benefit, what would happen to him? We know that he would be brought up with a right about turn by the law. But instead of going to that number of private individuals, he comes to members of Parliament, and asks them to legalize this wrong. What right have we to legalize a wrong? What right have we to grant to a particular individual an advantage at the expense of the rest of the community? I decline to give my vote in favour of allowing any individual to extract a sum of money from the pockets of the people. In the present instance protectionists are abandoning the principle which they themselves have insisted upon, namely, that there should be competition. According to the honorable member for Bourke, the nail factory established in Victoria can supply the whole needs of the Commonwealth, and yet we are asked to create a monopoly for the benefit of the particular individual who is interested in that factory. If the contention of the honorable member for Bourke is correct, he ought to have jumped at the proposal of the acting leader of the Opposition to impose a duty not exceeding 4s. per cwt., because that amount represents as nearly as possible a protection of½d. per lb. Upon reference to the other States I find that in New South Wales horse-shoe nails were admitted free ; in Queensland a duty of 3s. per cwt. was charged upon them ; in South Australia 2s. per cwt.;in Tasmania 2s. 6d. per cwt., and in Western Australia they were admitted free. In the face of these facts how can the Government proposal for the imposition of a duty of 4s. per cwt. be justified ? </para>

                    <para>Mr.G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - It is quite clear that the duty proposed is an indefensible one. None of the arguments advanced by protectionists in favour of other duties can have any application to this particular industry. It is admitted that there is only one factory to be considered, and that that factory could supply the whole needs of the Commonwealth. By levying any such duty as that proposed, it is abundantly evident that we shall be giving a monopoly to one man who employs only from seventeen to twenty hands. The honorable member for Bourke, in his excessive zeal, has contended that 70 per cent, of the cost involved in the manufacture of these nails is absorbed by the labour employed. Such a statement is absolutely ridiculous. There is no justification whatever for affording fiscal support to such a small industry. It is not our duty to create a monopoly for any one man, no matter what may be the nature of the industry in which he is engaged. To me it is patent that the honorable member for Bourke is radically wrong in his alleged facts. Instead of " revenue without destruction,'1 this is one of those items in regard to which we might safely say that we will have destruction without revenue. We are bound to act justly, and I would prefer that Parliament should vote this man compensation for closing his factory, than that we should saddle the community in perpetuity with the tax proposed. When the acting leader of the Opposition moved for a reduction of the duty to 4s. per cwt., he did what was absolutely just. I might further point out that the particular manufacturer in question would be better off with a duty of 4s. per cwt. operating and the market of the whole Commonwealth open to him, than he has been in the past under a 14s. per cwt. duty. </para>

                        <para>- I must confess that I knew very little of the horseshoe nail industry until I. heard the discussion which has taken place in connexion with it this afternoon. I have listened carefully to the arguments advanced on both sides, and have endeavoured to make up my mind as to what will be a proper protection to afford that industry under the circumstances. I cannot forget that a duty of 14s. per cwt. has been operating in Victoria, and that we have had supplied to us horse-shoe nails of as good a quality as those which could be purchased in the other States, and at as low a price. I admit that we cannot hope to build up a great industry in horse-shoe nails, because there is not the demand for them. But it seems to me that the consumer has benefited by the competition which has taken place, and it is my desire to see that benefit continued. I am quite satisfied that the unrestricted sale of horse-shoe nails by the importer without local competition is not a good thing, any more than is the creation of monopolies. I venture to suggest that the imposition of a duty of 5s. per cwt. would, perhaps, be a fair compromise under the circumstances. References to the duties which have prevailed in other States are utterly beside the question. They were purely revenue duties. My fear is that unless we protect the local manufacturer to some extent, the price of nails will inevitably be raised to the consumer. To my mind it is inconceivable that by increasing the duty from 4s. per cwt. to 5s. per cwt., there will be a chance of continuing the competition which has hitherto taken place, and of preventing that duty from becoming solely a revenue duty. Personally, I believe that a tax of 5s. per cwt. is high enough to enable justice to be done to all parties. Therefore if the proposal to levy a rate of 4s. per ewt. upon nails be lost, I shall move in favour of imposing a duty of 5s. per cwt. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the committee will not reduce the duty on horse-shoe nails below 7s. There is no wonderful principle at stake, and surely the toiling millions of the Commonwealth will not suffer any immense loss by the imposition of such a duty. The manufacturer of these nails came here from Canada at. a time when a reasonable duty was in operation in Victoria, and since he established his works the price of nails has never risen. That manufacturer came here because he was offered inducements, and it is claimed that British countries keep an honest contract with honest men. </para>

I heard the same identical, indefensible arguments 25 years ago, in the United States and Canada, as are now advanced against this duty, and to my mind they are absolutely " flyblown " arguments. "When Andrew Carnegie was establishing his great steel works in Pennsylvania, and he asked for a little protection, he was ' told that it would pay to pension him off rather than accede to his request. But the result there has been, that after 25 years of protection, some 167,000 men are employed in an industry which started on nothing. </para>

It would break up an industry which is employing a good many men, and enabling them to keep together nice little homes. This manufacturer, who found a suburb of Melbourne a wilderness, has turned it into an oasis ; in fact, that suburb has become one of the most important in the Commonwealth, all owing to the fact that this Canadian had the pluck to go there and build an industry which no man in the country had the intelligence to think of. Reason is the seed that the Lord sows in the heads of some, but unfortunately there is often barren soil. I appeal to the thinking men of the committee to vote for a duty of 7s. </para>

                            <para>- There is only one factory in the Commonwealth, so that it cannot be contended that competition amongst local producers has reduced the price. If the. honorable member's contention is correct, that these nails can be produced here, and sold as cheaply as the imported article, it is fair to ask why these nails are not extensively sold in the adjoining free-trade State? I gave the utmost attention to the honorable member's statement, being much interested in his sketch of the history of the industry, and I may say, without any reservation, that I am pleased to know that a factory of the kind has grown up under any conditions, and that it is possible to manufacture nails of a quality equal to those imported. But I cannot be persuaded that it is necessary to have the enormous duty proposed. I do not intend to enter into any discussion on the point raised as to the enormous profits made by importers. Those who understand the conditions of commercial life in Australia, or any other country, will agree that it is utterly impossible for such a state of tilings as that described to exist for any length of time. Where the world's imports are allowed freely into a market, it is impossible for trusts, combinations, or conventions to keep prices at an extravagant level for more than a comparatively brief season. I do not say that this article should be placed on the free-list, but I believe that the compromise suggested by the acting leader of the Opposition is fair and reasonable. The committee have admitted that a certain measure of protection or consideration should be conceded to industries that have existed for a considerable time. The doctrine of the Maitland speech, " Revenue without destruction," has been accepted to a certain extent, as was shown in previous divisions ; but I ask the committee not to unreasonably press the demand for consideration. When a proposal of a reasonable and temperate character is submitted, it ought to be accepted by honorable members in that spirit of compromise which should pervade all sections in the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to delay the committee in coming to a decision on this matter, but it does seem really remarkable that in connexion with every industry in which' a few men are employed in Victoria, strong efforts should be made to tax the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I am told that the duty proposed by the Government amounts to fully 40 per cent., and that the extra price that will have to be paid by the consumer will represent a still larger percentage upon the cost of the goods landed here. We ought to be extremely careful how we impose these duties, and I hope the committee will vote for a substantial reduction of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the Government will adhere to their proposal to impose a duty of 3s. per cwt. on wire nails. The honorable member for Wentworth states that the argument used with regard to horse-shoe nails applies with equal force in this instance. That would leave any one to imagine that there is only one factory in Victoria for the making of wire nails. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say, but certainly there are ten factories. In addition to that, some of the box-makers have their own wire nail-making machines. No doubt if the duty is knocked off they will cease using these machines, and will buy their nails. Two of the biggest box factories that I know of manufacture their own wire nails. Some honorable members appear to think that brads are not made in Victoria. I cannot say anything about tacks, but I know that 3 tons of brads a week are made in my own electorate. Various honorable members speak of the number of farmers they represent, but I think I can state that I represent more kinds of factories than any other honorable member. Not only the common wire nails but also roofing nails are made here. We are assured that the machine is only a one-boy machine, but as a matter of fact the cost of labour in that industry is from 25 to 45 per cent, of the cost of the article. I have no doubt that some honorable members will try to prove that prices have been reduced since the reduced duty came into operation. But they will not state what was the discount prior to the duty coming into operation. I have here a copy of an advice from a merchant, dated the 14th September of this year - more than three weeks before the Tariff was introduced - stating that his firm was prepared to offer a parcel of assorted sizes of wire nails at 35 per cent, discount off the lowest price. This advice is from one of the leading firms of ironmongers in the city. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that, but I have seen price lists showing that the price is1 5s net. The price to-day, I believe, is 15s. 6d. with 10 per cent, off for discount. I know also that in this State prior to wire nails being manufactured here the price was 4d. and 5d. per lb. It was owing to the high price of nails that a manufacturer started business in Melbourne. We have been able to extend the industry since. Is the policy of the Opposition "revenue without destruction" when they propose to make this article free of duty ? Do they want to close every industry that is already in existence here? We are now going to reduce the duty to less than half what it formerly was in Victoria, and I trust that honorable members will consider carefully before they consent to any reduction below what the Government propose. </para>

The warfare still went on owing to this duty not being sufficient, and I lost another£7,000 under the 5s. Tariff, and to save myself I again induced the Government to further increase the duty, which they did, raising it to 7s. 6d. in 1892. This enabled me to pay back the £16,000 that I lost, and the consumer has not been the sufferer, because nails have been sold over the counter for years at 2½d. per lb., against 6d. per lb. seventeen years ago. With my past experience I can assure you that the present Tariff proposed will be the means of wiping my industry and all others out of existence, and the £12,000 that I have spent in machinery alone will be worthless to me in the future. In conclusion, I beg for your earnest reconsideration of this item in the Tariff to save the destruction of this industry that has taken the best years of my life to establish, and were I offered the whole of Melbourne I would not again go through what I have done in paying back£16,000 that I lost under a Tariff of 3s. per cwt. </para>

                    <para>All I can say is that, if any other industry has paid as well as this nail industry under the Tariff that has existed in Victoria, I should be prepared to go through the same experience quick and lively. I venture to think that there is no honorable member who would not like the opportunity of going through that experience. Before this manufacturer sends out another circular I should advise him to consult his solicitor in order that it may be drawn out as a proper document. I do not know any other man inc. Australia who would give his show away in. the manner that this gentleman has done. It is quite enough for me to know that the nail-makers have been making enormous profits. I should be inclined to vote for placing wire nails on the free list, but as I have already said, this circular is so honest and candid that I shall vote for a duty of 2s. </para>

I am pointing out that these are the conditions with which honorable members opposite are asking to bring our workers into competition. We have been supplied with nails in Victoria made by our own people without extra cost to the consumer, and if the Government proposal is adopted no one is going to be injured. In regard to other items where there is local competition, we have nothing to fear, but it is not fair that our workers should have to compete with nail-makers working under conditions such as I have described. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that my honorable friend, the acting leader of the Opposition, or any one else who has spoken on this subject, has made it clear that this is an industry that has to be seriously considered in the industrial life of the Commonwealth. I do not know how these nails are made. I presume that they are made principally, if not entirely, by machinery. Indeed, there is no room for hand-work in connexion with them. Any one who knows anything about work in metals must see that. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who has spoken about the conditions under which wrought iron nails are made in England, was endeavouring to prejudice the mind of the committee by making honorable members believe that by putting nails upon the free list we should be encouraging people to make nails in competition with those most damnable conditions which he has described as existing in England. I reply that it is not so. I venture to say, without having exact knowledge on the matter, that at least 90 per cent, of the cost of these wire nails is in the material, and not in the labour. </para>

                            <para>- No. The honorable member does not seem to understand that he was talking about clout nails, or wrought metal nails. One cannot compare the two industries. At the same time I see no reason why these nails should not be made here just as well as anywhere else. I do not wish to hurt anybody who has an industry established here, and who is endeavouring to do his level best. The circular which was read by the honorable member for Maranoa states that unless the gentleman who is engaged in this industry receives a protection of 7s. per cwt., he will scarcely be able to carry on his business. He declares that under a tax of 3s. per cwt. he lost money, and that the same thing occurred under a duty of 5s. per cwt. It was only after the imposition of a tax of 7s. 6d. per cwt. that he began financially to feel his feet. The Government propose now to impose a duty of 3s. per cwt. If I am afforded an opportunity of voting either to admit these nails free or to place a duty of 2s. per cwt. on them, I shall certainly vote in favour of the latter course. I do not agree with the gentleman who declares that he cannot carry on without a protective duty of 5s. per cwt.; neither do I agree with the honorable member for Maranoa when he says that the manufacturer in question gave the show away. He gave the show away in that he stated that he made a good deal of money under a duty of 7s. 6d. per cwt. Now, he is asked to continue his business with the aid of a duty of 3s. per cwt., but with this difference, that he will have the whole market of the Commonwealth at his command, which he never had before. He has further the assurance that he will have a permanence under this Tariff, and therefore he has good business prospects. His industry is established ; he has the start of all other competitors, and under a duty of 2s. per cwt. he ought to do very well. I venture to suggest that he would prefer a duty of 2s. per cwt. to nothing. If an opportunity is not given me to vote for a duty of 2s. per cwt., I shall support the proposal to admit the goods free. </para>

                            <para>- I will go through the trade journal prices, which I quoted before in connexion with the debate on the motion of censure, and which I think give clear evidence of the effect of the 7s. 6d. duty in Victoria as compared with that of freedom of trade in New South Wales. The position is this : From September down to 8th October, the date on which the Tariff was introduced, the prices in Melbourne were 21s. 6d. per cwt., less 10 per cent, discount, which was equal to 19s. 4d. a cwt. The Sydney price was11s. 6d. neb. The duty in Victoria was 7s. 6d ; so that there was an increase of the local price proportionate to the duty. What occurred after the duty was reduced from ' 7s. 6d. to 3s. per cwt, ? That duty came into force in Sydney, as well as in Melbourne, so that the price ought to have been the same in both cities, and, as a matter of fact, the Sydney price went up on 10th October from11s. 6d. net to 14s. 6d. net, and the Melbourne price shrank from 19s.. 4d. per cwt. to 14s. 6d. per cwt. - that is, the same price as in Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- At the same time we are all flesh and blood, and we have some consideration for people who have been led into this sort of thing by those wicked statutes of Victoria. Consequently we do not want to deal unnecessarily harshly with them. From the Commonwealth point of view, the interests of one or two individuals, who have invested money in an industry, should not weigh with us more than a grain of sand in the scale when we are dealing with the great population of Australia. But the Opposition are willing to carry out their compact, and get "back to Maitland," as the saying is. Therefore I shall not press my amendment to place wire nails upon the free list, but shall content 'myself with moving that the duty be reduced to 2s.

                            <para>- Those are the prices at which parcels of 1 ton were sold to the merchants in the city. These nails were not worth more than £10 per ton at the other end of the world. Therefore, I repeat that, taking the average class of nails, the duty which the Government proposes more nearly represents 20 per cent, than it does the percentage given by the Minister for Trade and Customs. I admit freely that when we come to deal with the higher-priced goods the duty will work out very much lower. I do not know whether the information given by the right honorable gentleman represents the average price of the nails imported into Queensland, but in any case he did not make a fair statement to the committee. </para>

                            <para>- And they have been retailed at 2d. per lb. in New South Wales for the last eleven or twelve years at a good profit. The proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth gives a fair and reasonable measure of consideration to the local manufacturer. It may be said that this is an industry worth preserving even with a duty of 25 per cent, or 30 per cent., but the common sense of the committee will agree that 15 per cent, is reasonable for an industry which is well established, especially when it is remembered that we are practically placing the whole market of the Commonwealth at the feet of the Victorian manufacturer. One of the strongest arguments against New South Wales entering into federation was that that State would simply give an open market for Victorian manufacturers, and the reply given by those who favoured the union was that we would be met in a fair and reasonable spirit of compromise by the representatives not only of Victoria, but of all the States. But we have come to learn that there is not a very generous spirit of compromise abroad. There have hitherto been no duties on this article in New South Wales, and yet the proposed reduction, which leaves the duty adequate for revenue-producing purposes and for affording fair consideration to the industry, is simply scouted by the Minister for Trade and Customs. I do not blame the honorable member for Bourke for doing his best for the preservation of an industry in which he takes a great interest, but it must be remembered that we represent other interests and other people, who have not been subject to any kind of taxation on' this article. Victorians must know that it is a great concession on the part of free-traders to accept a duty of 15 or 20 per cent., and it is only fair that we should be met in the same spirit of compromise. </para>

                            <para>- Some nails cost free on board at Liverpool 28s. and 29s. per cwt., and there are some nails sold at 60s. a cwt. The price all depends on the gauge of the nails, and for sizes below 1 inch the price rises. The average price retail is about 2d. per lb. in Victoria, and to remove the duty will not benefit the consumer but the merchant, who is anxious to wipe out the manufacturer in order to make up for what he may have lost in the past. The proposed duty is not sufficient to give a monopoly, and the manufacturer will have to fight hard to hold his own. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs affords us a- lot of information which is not instructive, and, I am afraid, is sometimes not quite correct. The right honorable gentleman waa inclined a few momenta ago to make merry at my expense, and asked whether all nails stood at the same price per lb. I replied that a large proportion sell at the same price per lb., and the Minister, if he makes inquiries, will find that such is the .case in regard to nails from 1 inch up to' 4 inches, though occasionally, when they are longer, they become more expensive. Practically the price for nails is about 2Jd. per lb., the only difference being .that one gets fewer nails to the lb. in the larger sizes: I hope the Minister is satisfied. </para>

                            <para>- I Would ask the honorable member to look at the New South Wales Tariff, and see what we are asked to put up with. We have prospered in New South Wales without any of the iniquitous protective duties that have been imposed in Victoria. We have held our own satisfactorily, and all the unfair criticisms which have been passed upon our conditions by honorable members on the Government side of the Chamber cannot shake the undeniable facts of the case. I shall not further delay the committee, but shall take another opportunity of defending New South Wales against the attacks which have been made upon her. </para>
