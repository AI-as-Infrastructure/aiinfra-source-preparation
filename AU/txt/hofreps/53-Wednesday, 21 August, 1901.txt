I think that the committee, while agreeing generally that any newspaper or other publication containing obscene or indecent advertisements or other objectionable matter should be prevented from going through the post, will recognise that the Government propose to go further in this regard than the legislation of any of the States goes. </para>

                        <para>- The instances cited last night by the Prime Minister had application only to publications containing obscene and indecent matter, and 1 do not think there will be two opinions as to the procedure which should be adopted in regard to literature of that sort. But the question, what is seditious or blasphemous matter, is capable of such widely different answers that it seems to me improper to leave its determination to the Postmaster-General. A great deal may be urged against allowing a non-political officer to decide that matter, and, whatever may be so urged, applies with tenfold force against allowing an active politician to have the power. We can understand how the interpretation of blasphemy and sedition might be stretched in its application to a newspaper which happened to be obnoxious to persons in power. I think that the question should be remitted for decision to a judicial authority. It is a proper thing to provide that the courts shall have power to prevent the dissemination of blasphemous and seditious literature by means of the Post-office, and to punish those who are guilty of attempting to corrupt the public mind by publishing it. </para>

                    <para>- Although I am opposed to clause 55, which deals with letters, I think there is a great difference between newspapers and letters, and I quite agree that any matter that offends the public conscience, such as obscenity and that sort of tiling, should not be carried by the postal authorities. A newspaper is a special package which is sent through the post under favorable circumstances. It is open at both ends, and is conveyed under special conditions as to cost, which, perhaps, do not remunerate the Post-office, but which are intended to promote the spread of decent literature. In making these remarks, I wish to indicate clearly my position in relation to the course T shall take with reference to clause 55, because I consider there is no analogy between newspapers and letters. I quite -agree that there is no use in including in this Bill anything that it would take all the lawyers of Australia to decide, and leave us in the end knowing no more than we do now. Sedition is a thing which it is almost impossible to define - what is sedition to-" &lt;3ay may be gospel to-morrow - and I think that all reference to sedition might very well be omitted from the Bill. As I have said in connexion with previous Bills, we are wot now passing legislation for all time to come, and it will be very easy if some of the evils that are feared become rampant, to deal with them effectively in the future. In the meantime, our legislation ought to be based on common-sense principles, and therefore I think it would be better if we simply provided that the Postmaster-General should have the right to stop anything from passing through the post that would "Obviously offend the public conscience of a Christian people. </para>

                    <para>- I think the powers proposed to be conferred upon the Postmaster-General and Deputy Postmasters-General by this clause are such as it would be very unwise for this committee to intrust them with. I am just as. anxious as any one that our post-office should not be converted into a sewer by which filth may be conveyed to the people, to the demoralization of the subjects of the Commonwealth ; but .at the same time I desire to see our newspapers left free to canvass public questions in the fullest possible way, stopping short only at that point where criticism falls into anything that is likely to offend the public morality. If we look at the English Act, we shall find that there is no power whatever given to the Postmaster-General to stop newspapers or interfere with them in respect to any blasphemous or seditious matter, and that as to those matters in which the Postmaster-General of England can interfere, he has to do it with the sanction of the Government. Under the laws of the different States we have no provision whatever which empowers the Postmaster-General or .any one else to deal with seditious matter, and yet our laws have worked very well. I am not aware that any newspapers have been found guilty of propagating matter which might be regarded as seditious, even by the most hyper-critical. I would like to know who is to pronounce what is sedition - who is qualified to give a decision upon an important point of this sort save the most learned members of the legal profession ? How is the construction of this term, so difficult to define, to be intrusted to a political Minister possibly entirely untrained in the law, and who has within the Commonwealth absolutely no tradition or previous experience to guide him? </para>

It seems to me that we have had trouble enough without giving any one or any small number of men the right to interfere with the freedom of the people. I know for a certainty that if they had had such a power as this in Tasmania at the time of the federal elections my message would have been called blasphemous and seditious, yet the people of that State indorsed it by an enormous majority. Supposing a newspaper here wrote in favour of a republic, that would be sedition. </para>

                    <para>- I am going to support the amendment. The history of the past shows that such powers as those in the clause have been used to the detriment of true liberty. I think that the more liberty Ave give to the printing press the better it will be for the advancement of the community. We know very well that what is regarded as seditious to-day may not be considered as such to-morrow. The clause enables the Postmaster-General or Deputy Postmaster-General to exercise autocratic powers in dealing with these matters. He can say whether a paper shall be registered or not, and, so far as I can see, there is no appeal from his decision. Not only would the clause affect the printers and publishers of newspapers, but a great number of our standard classical works could be objected to under it. The Bible itself, the keystone of Christianity, might be brought under this definition of blasphemy and sedition. I believe that these matters should be dealt with by the ordinary criminal process, and that Ave should not establish another censor in our midst in addition to our courts of justice. In the interests of true progress I am going to vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member who has just sat down cannot be charged with disloyalty, but he is strongly against this provision in the clause. The amendment is worthy of our support, not merely because it is in the direction of progress -and liberty, but because it provides a safety valve such as that of a public meeting. Public meetings at Hyde Park, London, the Domain in Sydney, and the Yarra bank, Melbourne, are the safety valves of enlightened democracy, and if certain sections of the community are so weak in their loyalty and religion as to be affected by the passing through the post of what may be considered blasphemous or seditious matter, then we cannot say much for them. </para>

Upon such an appeal, a decision may be entered in his favour, and yet he will have no redress against the Postal department. In my opinion that is an arbitrary power to place in the hands of any Minister. </para>

                        <para>- No. Under my amendment the Deputy Postmaster-General may not stop a newspaper until he has called upon the printer, proprietor, or publisher of the newspaper in question to show cause why it shall not be removed from the register. It is only in the event of cause not being shown that a newspaper can be removed, and the removal is then to be subject to the right of appeal. </para>

                    <para>- I was very much inclined, as the -clause originally stood, to support the amendment, because of the difficulty which the Postmaster-General must experience in deciding what is obscene, indecent, blasphemous, or seditious. I was further inclined to accept the amendment, because if the Postmaster-General was mistaken in his decision - i-if he acted without sufficient discretion or from improper motives - there was no sufficient remedy for the newspaper proprietor. Now that the Prime Minister has foreshadowed certain alterations, however, I think that - the committee might very well accept the compromise. There are cases of indecency, obscenity, blasphemy, and sedition about which there can be no question and so intensely bad that the feelings of the great majority of the people would revolt against them. In such cases no action which had to wait the slow procedure of Jaw would be sufficient, and I am .quite sure the people would sustain the executive in taking prompt measures. The danger of speedy action is that it may proceed on improper grounds, but if it is provided, as proposed by the Prime Minister, that the very tribunal which has to decide whether the offence has been committed can award damages to the newspaper proprietor if the Postmaster-General is wrong, then I think we shall meet the best interests of the community, while we secure, at the same time, the rights of the newspaper proprietor. Another advantage of this provision is that it will deter the Postmaster-General from . acting unless he is absolutely certain that the court will sustain him in his decision. Newspaper proprietors will also exercise greater £are, and see that mo 'matter that may bring them within this clause gets into their publications. I am perfectly sure that no journal, whether it disputes the propriety of an existing -religion, or whether it desires to change our form of government in any lawful way, need ever fear this clause. It is only those journals which would undoubtedly publish seditious and blasphemous matter, about which there can be no question, that have cause to fear - and even 'those journals' have their remedy in the courts - so that I think we may safely adopt the course suggested by the Prime Minister. </para>

                        <para>- If the leader of the Opposition can give us any better method of dealing with this question than that hitherto found in every Postal Act, no doubt the committee will be pleased to adopt it. We are now dealing with the whole subject of whether we ought to control the delivery and circulation of certain publications. We have an officer who is intrusted with the administration of the Postal department, and to him, it seems to me, must be left the duty of deciding whether or not any particular publication is unfitted by reason of the matter which it contains to be transmitted through the post. If we provide that a person who suffers injury through any unwarrantable action on the part of the Postmaster-General can obtain compensation for such injury, I think we shall have done all that can be reasonably expected of us. </para>

                        <para>- The heat of the right honorable and learned gentleman was such that one might pardonably have thought that he was rebutting something of an opposite character, which was uttered from this side of the House. I acknowledge at once that a newspaper is different from a letter. The former is carried under certain specific conditions of cheapness. It is not closed like a letter, and there is no analogy between the two. The Prime Minister's arguments as to what really constituted a seditious article proved strongly to me the great difficulty of deciding upon such matters. We do not desire to see the Postal department made a sewer, neither do we wish - if I may make use of the expression - to make fools of ourselves as legislators by attempting to prevent the transmission through the post of things which we cannot define. I am inclined to think that the amendment suggested by the Prime Minister will offer a solution of the difficulty: Honorable members upon this side of the House were just as strong as he was against the circulation of seditious or blasphemous documents, 'but we wished to preserve the rights and liberties of the people at the same time. We were anxious not to put into the hands of the Postmaster-General the right practically to ransack all the newspapers which went through the Postal department. The whole difficulty with us was that, whilst the Postmaster-General should have some restraining power, there should not be relegated to him the judicial functions of a Judge. To a large extent, the dangers which we foresaw have been nipped by the suggested amendment of the Prime Minister. I understand that the process is to stop the issue at once and then ask the publisher to show cause. </para>

                        <para>- The suggested amendment does not go so far as that. We call upon him, before the circulation is stopped, to show cause. That is, as regards the removal from the register, but not as regards the transmission of' the publication through the Post-office. But we propose to amend subclause (3) by making it apply only to the particular issue in which the objectionable matter appears, so that any other issue may be transmitted through the post. </para>

We must be in the position to stop the issue, or else we had better leave the thing alone. The concession of the Prime Minister shows that he clearly grasps that our contention was right and that we were justified in talking up the position which we did. </para>

                        <para>- Obviously if it were to occur in the case of a daily newspaper the issue could not be stopped. I hold very strongly that the exercise of the very slightly mitigated authority which the Prime Minister proposes to confer might be a very grievous wrong to the proprietors of some journals. Pending a decision by the court upon the question of whether a newspaper contained blasphemous or indecent matter the issue of that newspaper would be stopped. In such a case the journal in question would be materially injured, if not absolutely ruined by this interference with its circulation. </para>

                        <para>- No. At the-. Postal Convention, which governs the postal rules of the whole of the civilized world, there was an agreement to make provision of this sort. The English Act is much more arbitrary than the Bill. The Post-office in England may absolutely stop the postage of a newspaper containing indecent, obscene, libellous, or grossly offensive matter, and there is no such right of. appeal as we propose to give. The English Act goes on to say that the decision of the Postmaster-General in these matters shall he final. The proposal made by the Prime Minister will be to the advantage of the public. If a newspaper is stopped by a political authority there should be some redress for the proprietor who feels aggrieved. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to that. This is not a question of interfering with a man's liberty of speech, but it is a question whether we are going to subsidize publications of the kind aimed at by the clause by carrying them through the post at a tithe of the rates charged for the transmission of books. That is the whole point of this debate. In all post-offices the Postmaster-General has absolute control over his department. With the safeguards suggested by the Prime Minister we need have no fear of hardship being inflicted on individuals from political or other motives. I think, however, that the words relating to " seditious and blasphemous " writing should come out. They are extremely difficult to interpret. The Post-office in America cannot carry any articles of an obscene or immoral character ; and I think it is right that this power should rest with the Postmaster-General. I do not consider that, as in England, the Postmaster-G general should be able to despoil a man of his business, and, perhaps, for the time being, of his character, without incurring any responsibility. There should -be some right of appeal on the part of the person who feels aggrieved, and the Government should take the fullest responsibility for its action. There should be the fullest right of compensation, to be determined by the ordinary legal process. If that be provided for, the safeguard is only a reasonable one. </para>

                    <para>- I was inclined to accept the amendment suggested by the Prime Minister, until I had heard the interpretation placed upon it by the leader of the Opposition. If that interpretation be correct, I shall adhere to the. amendment, which I moved a little while back. I naturally assumed that under the Prime Minister's proposed amendment the publisher of a newspaper would have the right to show cause to a Supreme Court Judge, and if he will amend his proposal in that direction, and also provide that a Supreme Court Judge shall decide the question whether or not an offending newspaper shall be removed from the register the committee should accept the amendment. Our desire is that in the event of the court refusing to indorse the action of the Postmaster-General, or of the Deputy Postmaster-General, then the proprietor of the newspaper in question should be entitled to recover damages and costs in respect to any interim damages accruing between the stoppage and the award of the court. The Prime Minister's amendment, however, comes after sub-clause (5), and it has been taken to refer only to damages accruing under the powers exercised by virtue of sub-clauses (3) and (4). </para>

                    <para>- I think that these words are likely to lead to a good deal of trouble. I remember a case which occurred in Queensland at a time when feeling was running pretty high in connexion with a leading financial institution there. One paper published a cartoon, and as a gentleman connected with the institution referred to regarded it as grossly offensive, he brought the matter before the Supreme Court. Although he was not successful in getting a verdict or suppressing the issue of the paper containing the cartoon, it cost the proprietors of the journal about £120 or £130 to defend themselves. The question is who is to decide what is grossly offensive. If a statement which was grossly offensive to any one man might be taken as bringing a paper within the reach of the law, I think that this clause would be very objectionable. It is all very well to say that we must trust to a little common sense being exercised, but we know that good old common sense often runs mad. I think the words ought to be left out. </para>

                    <para>- I presume from the statement made by the Minister in charge of the Bill that honorable members will have an opportunity of reviewing the clause when it is amended, so that we may see what its full effect will be and make any alterations or additions that seem to us to be required. I think it is important that we should have this opportunity, because the amendments may be more far-reaching in their effect than the words for which they are being substituted. Whilst we are laying so much stress upon the desirableness of stopping newspapers containing obscene or indecent matter from passing through the post, we have overlooked the fact that the mere stoppage of a few hundreds or thousands of newspapers from passing through the Post-office will not in any way affect the distribution of similar newspapers all over the States by other means. This seems to point to the conclusion that a Postal Bill is not the right place in which to deal with a question of this kind. If we desired to suppress the distribution of obscene or indecent literature there should be a means of doing it by process of common law. We are attaching altogether too much importance to the mere prevention of this matter from passing through the post. A great deal of our time might have been saved if this particular matter had not been introduced in this Bill at all, but had been dealt with separately under a law which would not only stop circulation through the post, but absolutely prohibit the publication of such papers. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to think that the States themselves have full power to deal with such questions, and, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, the powers given under section 51 of the Constitution Act to legislate for the peace and good order of the Commonwealth, might be held to include the suppression of indecent publications in the same way as they have been held to include the suppression of gambling through the Post-office. I do not suggest that that is the proper way of dealing with the matter, but it seems to me that one course would be just as justifiable as the other. </para>

                    <para>- I trust that the committee will fully consider the meaning of the words "grossly offensive." They might be made to include almost anything in the way of adverse criticism. I know of a case within the Commonwealth in which a Deputy Postmaster-General is the subject of very severe criticism by the press. He is continually described as incapable, and he is often spoken of as stupid, and he would no doubt regard such criticism, which perhaps is very rude, as grossly offensive to him, at any rate. It has been pointed out to the Prime Minister that any one who had a cause of grievance against the Postmaster-General might appeal to the Law Courts, but there is no certainty as to the interpretation the Law Courts might place upon the words " grossly offensive," and as the insertion of the words in the clause might tend to restrict the right of free criticism, I think they should be omitted. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the amendment would make the clause very much worse than it is. I have known a number of things published in newspapers which would have come under the definition of " grossly offensive." There is no end to such things, as articles appear in the papers every day that are grossly offensive to some individual. Where we see one case of obscene or blasphemous or seditious matter being published, there are hundreds of cases in which language which might be termed grossly offensive is used, and I shall vote against the insertion of these words. </para>

                    <para>- I protest against the proposed alteration of this clause, as I think the amendment is a step altogether in the wrong direction. The words proposed to be inserted are such as would permit a narrow - minded bigot to exercise a power which it would be altogether unwise to place in his hands.

                    <para>- But I would point out that all over the world it is the political head who exercises this power. Is it not worth considering whether the right of the Postmaster-General to control the transmission of these publications should be taken from him? I do not think that a Deputy Postmaster-General will be as wise in the exercise of his discretion - at any rate, I doubt if he will be as wide. If this power is put absolutely into the hands of Deputy Postmasters-General, it is more likely to be exercised than if it is allowed to belong exclusively to the Postmaster-General. Although honorable members may wish to remove the exercise of the power from political influence, I would rather trust its exercise to the Postmaster-General than to the various Deputy Postmasters-General. All over the world it is the Postmasters-General who [have the power to interdict the transmission of objectionable literature. But, according to my reading of the clause, we are vesting the power exclusively in the Deputy Postmasters-General. </para>

                    <para>- These sub-clauses must be read in conjunction. We must all realize that the size of the Commonwealth renders it impossible for the Postmaster-General to have complete knowledge of everything that is transpiring in his department in each of the States. This discretionary power to refuse to transmit or deliver certain publications may well be left in the hands of the Deputy Postmasters-General. A Deputy Postmaster-General has something to lose, and is not likely to be swayed by any religious or political feeling. He will know perfectly well that his retention of office depends on the manner in which he administers his department. It would be impossible to have it otherwise. </para>

                    <para>- I think the words proposed to be introduced will defeat the object of the clause. The clause, if amended as proposed, will mean that a Deputy Postmaster-General may refuse to transmit any " issue " of a publication if that issue contains objectionable matter. It is not the practice of a Deputy Postmaster-General or his staff to read every issue of a newspaper going through his office. It is not till after an objectionable publication has been transmitted that the public begin to realize that it is indecent or obscene; then it comes to the Postmaster-General's knowledge, and he takes action. If the provision is that he may refuse to distribute a. particular issue no good will be done. We might as well tell a boy to lock the door of a stable after he finds the horse has been stolen. I would suggest that the clause may be left as passed by the other House. I understand the Prime Minister does not approve of striking out the words " seditious " or " blasphemous." </para>

                        <para>- I quite well understand the feeling of the Prime Minister in the circumstances ; still I think these words "seditious" and "blasphemous" are not necessary from the public stand-point. Experience has shown that the word " seditious " is oftentimes misunderstood. Within the last month the Victorian Government have treated as seditious an article which, however lamentable in tone and taste, had no more of sedition in it than this Bill contains. That shows that there is a complete misapprehension, even in the mind of responsible Ministers, as to the meaning of the word. These words have already been omitted from subclause (1), and to be consistent they should be left out of sub-clause (3). I think that the words "indecent" and "obscene" are quite sufficient to cover anything that is unreasonably blasphemous. The proposed amendment should not be pressed, and I would also suggest that we adhere consistently to what we have already done in committee, by omitting the words "seditious" and "blasphemous." </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Prime Minister's recollection of this matter is twisted. It will not do for the right honorable and learned gentleman to make imputations, and then expect honorable members upon whom they are made to remain silent. I propose to show that this imputation is an utterly undeserved one. We were discussing in a broad way these words when, of the two sets, I expressed my preference for the English words. But I was expressing my objection to the words " seditious and blasphemous " altogether. I wish the Prime Minister to remember that those words were absolutely disapproved of by many honorable members on this side of the House. I directed my remarks to showing that I thought it most ill-advised to insert those words. Under these circumstances the English words were mentioned, and I at once said that I preferred them to the words " seditious and blasphemous." But as to there being an agreement that honorable members would tie up their political consciences and vote against their convictions, that is a ridiculous position to assume. The Prime Minister will recollect that I pointed out the strange position which these words occupied in reference to those which went before. I think that a " blasphemous " publication might fairly be held to come within the category of an " indecent " publication, because if any publication is one which, shocks the moral sense of the community its circulation ought to be prohibited. As to words "or grossly offensive character," they could only include " sedition and blasphemy " if the word " in- decent " had a similar relation to them, because it is a well-known rule of construction that words of a general character which follow precise words are always to be construed with reference to those precise words. There is scarcely a word in our language with a wider meaning than the word " in decent." What the Prime Minister really wants to get in the Bill, it seems to me, is contained in that word. But if he has a fondness for the words " seditious " and "blasphemous," of course, after the appeal which he has made to his supporters, they are bound to rally round him. It is, therefore, highly probable that his view will be adopted. There will not "be the slightest consistency, however, in the Bill if this amendment be made. It will then wear the extraordinary aspect that the Federal Parliament has laid it down that if a newspaper is merely "blasphemous or " seditious," it cannot be taken off the file of registered newspapers, but if it is "indecent" or " grossly offensive," it can. I think that the words which we already have cover those which the Prime Minister desires. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the Prime Minister has taken so much exception to the action of- the committee in striking out the words "seditious" and " blasphemous." I voted for the amendment, because I think it is well for us not to take wider powers under the Bill than the experience of the States has proved to be necessary. We have not had ' these words in our State Acts, and why then should we put them into this Bill ? If it could be shown that they were necessary, I should be in favour of retaining them, and I feel sure that if it is necessary at any future time to make more stringent provision, the Parliament will support the Government in making it. I take it, however, that the people of Australia are not more likely to send seditious or blasphemous literature through the Post-office in the future than they have been hitherto, and therefore [shall vote for the retention of existing conditions. But I have a right to act in that way without being accused, either directly or by imputation, of doing something which is likely to cause the fair fame of Australia to be besmirched. After all, the matter is not highly important, and the whole trouble has been caused by the endeavour of the Government to take greater powers than have hitherto been found necessary. </para>

The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has stated that, in his opinion, it virtually amounts to the closing of the stable door after the steed has been stolen but I would point out to him that this is not a penal clause, nor a clause to prevent the publication of indecent literature ; it is a provision to prevent a State institution from being used for the dissemination of such literature. As the dissemination of such literature cannot be prevented if we wait until an issue has gone through the Post-office, we must give the Deputy Postmasters-General power to stop it at once. </para>

In deference to their own leader, honorable members of the Opposition gave up the objection which the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has resumed. I hope the honorable and learned member will not consider that there is any want of courtesy on my part.

                        <para>- I say that any ' man who stirs up strife in a community in order to subvert the established form of government, except by such means as are constitutionally allowed, is guilty of sedition, and I do not think that any honorable member could prove the contrary. There is sedition against the State as much as against the Crown, and it is wise for us, to protect the Post-office against becoming a vehicle for the promulgation of seditious writings. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that I cannot take the advice of the Minister in charge of the Bill. With me this is a matter of faith. We can look at the history of Ireland and read of the thousands of her peoples whose hones are sleeping in the silent bivouac of the dead, as the result of the laws enforced against sedition. Some of my ancestors in Ireland are now in graves which are not marked by tombstones, in consequence of the improper interpretation of these words "seditious and blasphemous." They had died fighting against a tyrannical Government that usurped the rights of the people. The British Empire has abolished the old antiquated ideas of blasphemy and sedition, and yet it is proposed that this enlightened Federal Parliament should put them into this clause, so that we may have a taste of tyranny in this Southern Hemisphere. Did any one ever hear of a man thinking with a sword over his head, or with a gun at his ear. If we want thinkers we do not want to shut people up, and we must not tyrannise over them. Blasphemy is what the dying call the growing. Sedition -is the expression of something which is opposed to generally accepted ideas. I hope the committee will stand firm on this question, and that they will not permit the freedom of the people to be taken from them, but that they will send blasphemy and sedition where memory forgets and oblivion remembers. </para>

                        <para>- What the honorable member might call blasphemy or sedition I might not. We might have a Mahometan or a Buddhist at the Post-office, and what he might consider blasphemy we might not. What is blasphemous, or libellous, or seditious is a matter to bet determined by a court of law. I am not in favour of spreading sedition throughout the land, and I believe that there are constitutional means of remedying the ills from which we suffer ; but we shall not aid the cause of law and order by restricting the liberty of the individual or of. the press, and I do not think it would be wise to put it within the power of any one man to say whether a certain matter is blasphemous orseditious. </para>

                        <para>-One of the great advantages of federal union promised by its advocates was that we were to have a uniform stamp. Such a stamp would certainly be a great convenience to those who live in our border towns. Now that the Commonwealth Government have assumed control of the Post-office, surely it is time that we had a federal stamp. I venture to say that it has come as a very great surprise to the community generally to find that the Government are hesitating about adopting the course which I now suggest. "We have been told that the bookkeeping clauses will prevent the adoption of a uniform stamp for the Commonwealth, but I fail to see any substantial grounds for that objection. I am not asking that the postage should be uniform, because I recognise that a difficulty presents itself on account of Victoria having adopted the penny postage system. An interchangeable stamp would satisfy me. </para>

                    <para>- If we look at this matter with a microscope, there may seem to be some technical difficulty about having a uniform stamp, hut when we come to consider the operations of business, there would be a very slight variation in the results, as compared with what they are under the present system. There are very few people who trouble themselves about postage stamps when they are moving from one State to another, and certainly great inconvenience is experienced, now that the Commonwealth is united, in having six different kinds of stamps. It is an unnatural state of affairs, and it should not be allowed to prevail longer than necessary. I do not wish to see anything put into the Bill to bind the Government, but 1 would rather make my observations in the form of an appeal to the Prime Minister, that the difficulties about bookkeeping, should not be allowed to stand in the way of making this change. </para>

I hope, therefore, that the Government will give themselves the pleasure and satisfaction of making this change. I would look upon it as a great distinction if' I had an opportunity of initiating a Commonwealth stamp. I do not think that a Bill is the proper place to deal with a matter for Executive action, but I strongly support the object that the honorable member for the Barrier has in view, and I hope the Government will speedily bring this change about. </para>

                    <para>. - I would ask the honorable member for the Barrier not to press his amendment to the vote. He may rely perfectly upon the desire - more than that, the determination - of this Government to issue Commonwealth stamps as soon as we can get over any preliminary difficulties that may stand in the way. There is one difficulty, as has been pointed out, in connexion with the bookkeeping clauses of the Constitution Act. For my own part, although that matter has been referred to a good deal in conversation and in press paragraphs I do not think that it forms such an insuperable obstacle as some people suppose. But, dealing quite fairly with the matter, I do admit that it rests . considerably upon the "Tattersall's" clauses in the Bill. Investigation has shown that the stamps which are forwarded in letters and which are placed on letters sent from Tasmania in connexion with "Tattersall's" sweeps, amount in value to £14,000 a year. If the "Tattersall" sweep clauses of the Bill are not carried in their present form the revenue will be ear-marked, and will, therefore, have to be put to the credit of the revenue of Tasmania. If, however, the clauses are carried, we may be able to do something in the direction indicated by the honorable member at a very early date. I would ask my honorable friend not to put his proposal to the vote, because I do not think it is a kind of provision that ought to be in a Bill of this character, which should be composed of enactments of law, and not mere directions to the Executive. If the honorable member will take my assurance that - assuming the difficulty which now arises in connexion with "Tattersall's" sweep to be got rid of - as soon as departmental action can be taken it will be taken, for the issue of Commonwealth stamps, I think the general sense of the committee will be with me in asking him to refrain from pressing his proposal. </para>

Pending a decision upon that matter, I think it is better not to press the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad to hear it, because there was an impression that it was the bookkeeping clauses that created the difficulty. The Federal Government ought to be able to deal with this matter irrespective of "Tattersall's," and an important change of this kind ought not to depend upon whether the Post-office is to be used for conducting racing sweeps. I will withdraw my amendment as it seems to be the general wish of the committee, but I am rather glad that the question has been raised, because we know now the full importance of the clauses dealing with " Tattersall's " sweeps. If it comes to a question as to whether we are to allow sweeps to be conducted through the Post-office, or to have interchangeable stamps, I will vote in favour of having interchangeable stamps. I think the committee will take it that the Prime Minister has assured us that if the "Tattersall" clauses are passed, there is a strong probability that before the year is out we shall have an interchangeable stamp. I am not asking for a uniform stamp, because there might be a difficulty about that owing to the large loss that might be incurred under a penny postage system. </para>

By this; arrangement no harm is done, but if the stamps were made interchangeable a considerable difference would be found in the revenue derived by the States from the sale of stamps. </para>

                    <para>- Power is taken under clause 93 to prescribe the form and mode of issuing licences for the sale of stamps, and the commission to be allowed. In remote towns where there are no post-offices, or in1 cases where the post offices are some miles away, it is a great convenience to the settlers that the local storekeepers should be licensed to sell stamps. In Western Australia licensed vendors are not permitted to buy stamps from the local postmaster, but are obliged to send to the General Post-office in Perth, pay the postage each way and the cost of registration, and take all the risks of the stamps being consumed by fire or lost in transit, all for the mere pittance of 6d. in the £1. Why should local postmasters not be allowed to keep sufficient stamps in hand to supply licensed vendors as well as the public? There is no reason for the idiotic practice which prevails in Western Australia, and I ask the Prime Minister to see that is is not continued under the Commonwealth. Owing to losses sustained under the practice in Western Australia, storekeepers, who do not go into the business for the purpose of making money by it, but solely for the convenience of their customers, have given up selling stamps- </para>

                        <para>- That may be, but this clause will have to be administered by men who are not so well up in the law as the Prime Minister, and they may make mistakes. I do not wish to move an amendment, but l submit that the clause should be modified. If it is necessary, as I think it is, to give the Postmaster-General power to stop anything which is manifestly obscene or indecent from going through the post, let the power be given in such a way that it will not include matter that may be held by the court to be innocent, and not used to punish any one not deserving of punishment. </para>

                    <para>- I am not in a position, on the spur of the moment, to say what Bankruptcy Acts in the various States contain such a provision, but I am aware that this proceeding can only be taken by the assignee obtaining an order from the court, and that the court prescribes the period within which the bankrupt's letters shall be handed over to the official assignee. Remittances may be coming to a bankrupt, and these naturally are the property of the court. I believe that we have a similar provision in Tasmania. If so, it is the transcript of English legislation. Surely when a man's property is within the purview of the court, and there is reason to fear that it is being misapplied, every opportunity should be given to the official assignee to protect the creditors in the estate. If it is found that letters, which are delivered up in accordance with an order of the court, do not contain property, it is to be assumed that they will be returned. Section 104 of the Insolvency Act of Victoria provides that letters may be readdressed and sent to the Judge, and I think that we should have some similar provision in this Act, because the sole object is to protect the creditors, and see that an insolvent does not escape from the just directions of the court, but there is no intention to inquire into his purely private affairs. </para>

                    <para>- No State has any power to order the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth to do anything in his official capacity ; but this clause assumes to give that power, and the Postmaster-General would have to act under the direction of this Parliament, and of this clause, which imposes an obligation upon him. If it were not for the clause I doubt if a bankruptcy court would have the power to direct him to forward letters. But the clause will require considerable modification. In the first place I would like to know if the Minister has considered whether the word "adjudged," in the first line of the clause, includes cases of voluntary sequestration as well as compulsory sequestrations. Again, further on, two different "orders" are referred to. There is the order of the court, and then the order of the Postmaster-General, and which order is referred to in the following line it is difficult to say. </para>

                    <para>- This clause might be amended slightly to meet cases that frequently arise. It provides at present that postal articles addressed to a deceased person may be delivered only to the executors or administrators on the production of the probate or letters of administraction, and in other cases the articles have to be opened. It frequently happens that letters addressed to- a deceased person arrive between the time of death and the actual granting of probate or letters of administraction. There is a very proper practice in the Victorian Post-office to deliver these letters to near relatives sometimes on official information or verba] statement, or on the making of a statutory declaration by the persons to whom the articles are delivered. In the case of many estates it is not worth while j to take out probate or letters of adminis-' tration, and why should letters in these cases have to be opened ? I suggest that the words " as may be prescribed " should be added, in order that the sensible practice of delivering these articles where it is perfectly clear who is entitled to them may be carried out on the making of the statutory declaration, or as may be prescribed. </para>
