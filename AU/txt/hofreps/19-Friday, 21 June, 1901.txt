                        <para>- That is the form applicable to any amendment, but it is none the less applicable to a suggestion. The fact is that the Senate has observed its province so far as this matter is concerned by making suggestions and requesting concurrence. The precise form to be followed is not a vital question; it is the spirit of the message which has to be considered. The spirit which dictates' this message - without reference to other things, which I will advert to further on - is evidently that of suggesting to this House certain alterations in which the Senate requests our concurrence. The fact that it requests concurrence does not vitiate those suggestions in the slightest degree, nor does the fact, that- the request for concurrence has been applicable in the past to amendments, make it any the less a suggestion. The whole thing breathes the spirit of suggestion. Therefore I do not intend to quarrel with the message on the mere matter of form. As to the substance of it I shall have something to say presently, but I am not wholly in accord with the suggestions. Tho position of the House of Representatives is that if it thinks fit to make any of the amendment suggested, with or without modification, it can do so. As to two of the suggested omissions, I think that the House can make them without any loss of dignity, or without giving away any principle, so long as in respect of the third it maintains the position indicated for it by the Constitution. The suggestion, that I mention as the third is the one -which, in the memorandum, stands as No. 2, and it suggests that we leave out of the recital the words - </para>

                        <para>- I will have as many copies as are here handed round. As I have already said, I think that two of the requests can be acceded to without any loss to the position of this House, and while I think that non-accession to them would provoke an unnecessary delay in supply, and also an unnecessary fight about what is after all not a matter of principle, I consider that, a matter of principle is involved in that which ' I have just . read. It is quite' true, and every one will admit it, that the grant of supply is not complete until the Bill appropriating supply has passed, so that to that extent the-' Senate and the House of Representatives exercise a degree of co-ordinate: power. As to the matter, manner, method, and time; and, as to the limits of mode and so on, those questions are not involved here, .because the Senate have not attempted to alter any of the items of supply mentioned in the Bill. So long as they leave the Bill alone in respect of the supplies - which we wish to be granted, the rest is a' matter of form rather than of substance. But' there is this one instance in which I do not propose to adopt the ' suggestion of the' Senate, and I intend to put before the House a modification of it, which .really states the constitutional position of this House, and to which, I think, the Senate cannot take any objection, unless it is very unwise. It will be understood, of course, that in this power of suggestion there is absolutely no power of amendment, t rests with this House to moke amendments in the Bill, or to refuse to do so, if we please. That principle we strictly lay down, so that whatever there may be in a suggestion from the Senate, that suggestion can have no force or effect except this House chooses to accede to it. If we think that a suggestion is relevant to the matter in hand - if we think it is important, or one which can be acceded to without loss of dignity or privilege, we can accede to it, but only by making the amendments ourselves ; because the text of this Bill cannot be touched by the . other House. That principle I wish to be clearly understood, because I coincide with it entirely. </para>

                        <para>- Suggestion is, as I have been reminded, a colloquial term for the constitutional right of the Senate. We shall not quarrel with the form of the message, because it uses this word " suggestion " instead of the word " request," inasmuch as the word " request " might be a stronger term than the word "suggestion." The title of the Bill is - " An Act to apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund" a certain sum, and the first suggestion of the Senate is that we should insert two words, and call it - " An Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue "Fund." The root of that suggestion is that the Senate claims that its concurrence is necessary in a grant. That is true to the extent that the grant cannot become law without the consent of both Houses, and for the grant to take effect in an Act, the consent of both Houses is necessary. The next suggestion is the more important one. But I will pass that over so that I may deal with the third and less important suggestion. In clause 1 there are the words - </para>

                        <para>- I want to show, not only by the certificate on the Bill, but by the retention of the words I have read, that this is one of those Bills which can only originate in this House - which must originate here and nowhere else - and a Bill in regard to which constitutional practice had been followed. To that extent I think we ought to push our difference with the Senate, but there is no necessity to push it further. Having maintained the principle - and reinstated the words in the Bill - I think we have done enough. Honorable members will recollect that 1 spoke on this question last week, pointing out the tendency in regard to' all enactments to dispense with the preamble and confine oneself to the enacting words. That is a tendency which has been exemplified in forms of legislation and even in Supply Bills in some of the States. The position now is that we have inserted words which bear indication that the grant has originated here, but if the form of words is objected co we can maintain the substance by saying in distinct terms that the grant was originated by us. I propose to go to that extent, but it would be fatal to go any further, because I see no real ground of quarrel between the two Houses. The real question was whether the Senate were going to suggest any interference with the sums and amounts and the method of their distribution which we in our grant originated in 'the House, and which were comprised in the Bill. As I find no attempt at such interference I am to a large extent content. If I found any attempt to interfere there I should fall back on the fact that, although the Constitution allows another House to suggest, it is still for us to determine whether we shall allow any grants to be interfered with, and in such a case I should be entirely on the side of this House. But I find no cause of quarrel here, and I propose that a course shall be adopted which I think will obviate any cause of quarrel - a course which does not tend to the whittling away one jot of any of the principles laid down or expressed in the Constitution Act, and one which in the spirit of constitutionalism as ordinarily accepted outside Constitution Acts has not the effect of whittling down anything that belongs to us. </para>

                    <para>- I have very little to say on the subject. It seems to me that the Government are . taking the right course. After all, in reviewing the debate there is no doubt in my mind that under no possible circumstances can the rights of this House as contained in section 53 of the Constitution Act be interfered with. The only question which probably some of the legal members of the House may throw some light on is the difference between the words " made by " and the words "originated in." If we take the course proposed by the Prime Minister we simply keep to the Constitution, and certainly, so far ' as this Chamber is concerned, the Senate can find no fault with the amendment except, perhaps, because it is surplusage. Section 53 says that proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys or imposing taxation shall not originate in the Senate. That provision is quite clear, and we are simply re-enacting it by using the words " for the purpose of appropriating the grant originated in the House of Representatives." Looking at it in that way the words in the preamble are surplusage, reenacting or copying the words of the Constitution to provide against any possible future inroads upon our privileges under the Constitution. </para>

                        <para>- We might do that, but so far as the present case is concerned we are dealing with Money Bills, and with the question as to the words to be used in these Bills in the future, and whilst I am not at all bound to the proposal now before the House, because it is much more a matter of legal construction than anything else, I think we ought to settle exactly the terms of the preamble of our Money Bills. . As a layman, I naturally speak with very considerable diffidence on this matter. It seems to me that in their essence the words are surplusage, and that we are simply repeating in a positive form that which occurs in the Constitution in a negative form as regards the other House. The point the honorable and learned member for Indi takes is, I think, worthy of consideration, because it is a well-known rule that if you limit your rights to any extent, you may possibly cramp yourself as far as your larger rights are concerned. However, I am inclined to be entirely guided in this matter by the House, and especially by those who are authorities on constitutional subjects, although, at the same time, it seems to me that the words cannot be objected to by the other House, except on the ground of surplusage. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has spoken somewhat slightingly of preambles, and if his view were entertained as to preambles being unnecessary elements in Supply Bills, why, may I ask, was the preamble inserted in the first Supply Bill brought down to this House? -The historic preamble, familiar in all our Legislatures, was inserted in the first Supply Bill, and the Government asked the House to accept it in the old original form. The House complied, and ratified the principle of the preamble. Now we are asked to accept the view that preambles are unnecessary and have passed out of date. This seems to me scarcely a consistent attitude for the Government to take up, and I hope we shall adhere to the form of preamble to be now agreed to. As I said when this question was raised before, I am not wedded to any particular form of preamble as long as the principle of initiation is placed upon the face of the Bill. There is an organic difference between Bills appropriating revenue and any other form of Bills. ' As regards other Bills, the powers of the two Houses are equal ; but in the origination of Appropriating Bills those powers are not equal. This House has the supreme power of origination, but messages from the Crown recommending appropriations must be presented to this House alone ; that is, must be presented to the originating House. So that in these two features this House is essentially different from the Senate : in its exclusive right to receive messages recommending supplies, and in its exclusive right to originate appropriations. I contend that Bills so recommended, based upon a Royal message, ought to bear upon their forefront the source of their origination, and the fact that we had agreed to the message to the Crown. I am not wedded to any form of words as long as words are put in that show, first, the origination of appropriations, and, secondly, that they are based upon messages from the Crown. Any words that are capable of conveying these two principles I am willing to acquiesce in, and I think we ought to expect so much. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; I agree to any form of words that shows upon the face of the Bill the fact of its origination. But, at the same time, I think it should go further and say that the Bill is based upon a recommendation from the Crown. The Crown recommends by message. What then takes place is that the message is referred to a committee of this House. It may be dealt with by the House as a whole, but as a matter of constitutional practice the message is always considered in Committee of Supply. In Committee of Supply a resolution is arrived at that supplies be granted to the Crown. That resolution is reported to the House. The House agrees to the resolution, and a Bill is brought in based upon it. I hold that these Bills should bear upon the face of them something to show that they are based upon a message from, the Crown, and originate in the House of Representatives in accordance with the recommendation of the Crown. Honorable members may . ask what is the utility of this procedure ? The reason for it - and it is a very special reason - is that questions may hereafter arise as to the constitutionality of these Supply Bills. They may come before the High Court. The High Court will judge of a Bill from what appears on the face of it, and if it appears that the Bill in question was intended to make an appropriation within the Constitutional requirements, the High Court will know that it is dealing with a class of Bill different from the ordinary form of legislation. </para>

I shall be willing to acquiesce in what is proposed, so long as the word " grant" is kept in.

                        <para>- I quite agree with that, and am glad to hear that such is the. proposal of the Government. But going back to the message from the Senate, I think that, before we proceed to consider the suggestions, a message should be returned to the Senate, and it should be pointed out to that Chamber that in asking the concurrence of this House they are exceeding their constitutional powers and rights. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite sure that in this matter every one will agree that we have no party question to deal with. We are all agreed also- that it should be debated in the most solemn, careful, and, if 1 may use the expression, cold-blooded fashion. Further, I am thoroughly assured that the Government feel that they are doing what is right towards maintaining the Constitution and conserving the rights and privileges of this House, and are actuated by no desire except, while stoutly maintaining the real substantial rights and privileges of the House of Representatives, to . discard any rigid adherence to forms which they think ma)' cause conflict. I go with the Government thoroughly in all that; but, notwithstanding, I cannot agree that the course they propose to the House is the right one. We are now upon the threshold of a proceeding which may, by constant and continuous encroachments, involve the whole future of responsible government. Much mischief may follow from a simple misunderstanding of the nature of these proceedings. At the outset I thoroughly indorse what has been said by my honorable and learned friend the member for Bendigo with regard to the form of the message from the Senate. We ought to refuse to sanction that particular form of message ; because although it uses the word "suggests" - a word not used in the Constitution - it asks the concurrence of this House in something which has been done by the Senate. This House is asked to "concur" - that is the word used, I believe - with regard to the amendments suggested; and if a word not used in the Constitution - "suggests" - is used here, ar.d we are asked to concur in the suggestion, I see no practical difference between the Senate amending and asking our concurrence in their amendments, and their suggesting and asking our concurrence in their suggestions. The Constitution says that if the Senate wishes an amendment to be made, it is to request this House to make it, and then it proceeds to state that this House may, if it thinks fit, do what is requested. To my mind the word "request" in that collocation is of infinitely weaker import than the word "suggest" as used in this message. The word "request" is, as it purports to be, a request to this House to do something if it thinks, fit. There is nothing to concur in, and we are left absolutely to our own discretion to say whether anything shall be done or not. I therefore say that the form of the message is not one that ought to be entertained. In the next place, on the merits, I' think a distinction has been lost sight of. When we speak of the Constitution, it should be recollected that our Constitution is not completely contained within the pages of a written document. We have behind those written pages a history. We have behind those words, which appear in cold type, a long period of constitutional usage. When we were building up our Constitution, we did it knowing that we were basing that fabric upon the bed-rock of what I may call the common law of the Constitution. When we formed our two Houses, we distinctly intended that, as far as possible, one House should have the predominant financial power. We had precedents to go upon which should not be disregarded. We know what is meant by the word "grant." In. Great Britain, no less than in Australia, a legal grant in one sense is not made, and cannot be made, except by the two Houses of Parliament. But there is another sense in which the word "grant" is used; and that is that it is done by a vote of the House of Commons on the recommendation of the Committee of Supply and -with the sanction of the Crown. It is in that sense that the word " grant " is used in some portions of this Bill. I will take for. example, to illustrate what I mean, the last Appropriation Act passed by the Imperial Parliament. There a " grant " is not made in the sense in which the Senate wishes us to limit the word, except by the concurrence of the House of Lords with the House of Commons. In the English Appropriation Act I find the word " grant " used in two senses. In one sense it means a grant made by the House of Commons by itself by resolution, and in the other sense it is used in the signification of an Act of Parliament. We have in the first clause of the Bill before us the words " supply granted," which can only mean the amount of supply granted by this House.. The insertion of the word " hereby " before the word " granted " would in my opinion distinctly alter the complete sense of what was done. Let me draw honorable members' attention to this provision. It says - " There shall and may be issued and supplied for or towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty." </para>

                    <para>- I very much regret that the Ministry, by their action in having neglected to exercise a little thought and care, have placed this House in the position of having to back down to the Senate. We must of course back down, because the Senate is undoubtedly in the right. Ministers are very blameworthy for not having carefully considered these matters. If they had devoted a little attention - even h'alfanhour - to the first Supply Bill, that measure would not have been returned by the Senate. This House on that occasion was so clearly wrong that the Ministers tossed the Bill under the table and brought in a fresh one. </para>

                        <para>- I look upon the Ministry as wrong, and if we adopt the first part of this preamble, the Senate, acting within their rights, will send the Bill back to us again. Section 53 of the Constitution clearly states that these Bills shall originate in the House of Representatives. If any constitutional point is going to arise in connexion with it, 1 would refer honorable members to section 76, which says that any matter arising under this Constitution, or involving its interpretation, shall come under the notice of the High Court. Of course, the form of the preamble would not come under the notice of the High Court, but the legality of acts done by one House or the other might and should come under its jurisdiction. Honorable members are too much under the old idea that the Lower House is ' all paramount. But we have departed from that very sound principle - a principle which was built up by ages of struggle - and we have granted to the Senate certain rights under this Constitution. Since the Constitution confers those rights we cannot deprive the Senate of them. No amount of assertion on our part can take them away. I have no desire to help the Ministry, but when I see the disabilities which may ensue if this Bill is not passed, I must say that I think that the Government should accept the suggestions of the Senate. By so doing they will be acting strictly within constitutional limits, and even if they do not do so- </para>

We should never have precipitated a collision with the other Chamber, and if we had sent anything up there we should have stood to our guns.

                        <para>- In trying to make this matter a little clear, I can quite understand that there are those who, having opposed this Constitution from start to finish on the ground that it gave too much power to the Senate, are now seeking to elevate the Senate into the superior House. The whole air rang during the referendum contest with the complaints of gentlemen such as some whom I see in the Senate, who are trying now to arrogate to the Senate superior power, although the Senate has not been with them, and who all through the contest were endeavouring to make out that this Constitution could not be assented to, because it gave undue powers to the Senate and made it the supreme House. I wish to put the matter on a purely constitutional basis, and I think I am doing so. I want to bring it back to the honorable and learned members for Indi and Bendigo that the suggestion that this matter depends on the relations between the Commons and the Lords might be right if we were a Legislative Council fighting with a Legislative Assembly, but has absolutely no reference to ' the Constitution which has been passed. I wish to maintain the relative positions of the two Houses - to maintain the lights of the Senate, but to make no undue concession to that Chamber. Of course, there must be a certain amount of mutual "courtesy in the carrying on of the relations of the two Houses, otherwise these Houses could never be the working engines of the Constitution. But apart from that, there must be a reasonable and strict adherence to our rights, and I ' propose to consider those rights as laid down in the Constitution. Whoever heard of the suggestion before that there is anything in our Constitution which places the Senate in the position of the House of Lords? The powers of the Houses in respect of legislation are clearly defined in sections 53 and 54. Section 53 says : - </para>

There is no foundation for the analogy, unless that analogy is set up by sections 53 and 54, because otherwise the words I have quoted would have been put in as a delusion, to cause the people of the smaller States to vote for a Constitution, in which it was assumed that certain rights which were given were not to be exercised in fact. Our true position is to concede to the Senate its legal rights, and to insist upon having our own legal rights; These proposals of mine are simply upon those lines. It is quite clear from this Constitution that a proposed law, which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall not originate in the Senate. But anything, to be an appropriation must have the assent of both Houses. Although a proposed law appropriating revenue must originate in the House of Representatives, that does not detract from the constitutional result that there cannot be an appropriation without the consent of both Houses. Now it is asked that words should be inserted indicating that which is the form prescribed by the Constitution. It might have been as well if the Senate had passed this matter over, because the Constitution regulates our rights. But if in one of these amendments we assert our right to originate, as I propose to do, it is done by way of showing that if the Senate assert their right to be participants in the grant, we can only admit that right if they admit our reciprocal right to originate the grant. </para>

                        <para>- The Senate cannot dispute our right to originate the grant, and in the same way we cannot dispute their right to participate in the grant. The position is that we will concede to the Senate their undoubted constitutional position, if the Senate will concede our undoubted constitutional position ; and if they make an offer to accept what we propose in return, the true position between us has been reached, and no precedent has been set. to injure the prestige or power of either. I do not propose to follow the suggestions of the honorable and learned, member who last addressed the committee. No doubt we are a slipshod Ministry, as the next and every Ministry will be; but the Ministry does not always go about with its football boots on. Still, though we are a slipshod Ministry, I ask honorable members how far they credit the statement made by the honorable member that he would not be a party to such a mistake. The honorable member said "We would not have fallen into this- mistake." Honorable members have had experience of that honorable member, and are able to say what mistakes he would fall into, and what mistakes he could avoid ; and I shall now leave the honorable member alone, merely suggesting that after all it is not those who have the least experience amongst us, who should suggest any undue concession to the Senate. To those who consider the matter fairly, it is clear that if we demand any defined rights for ourselves, we must be prepared to concede the defined rights claimed by other people. The Senate are undoubtedly entitled to participate in the grant by helping to give it the form of law. They are entitled to make good supply, to the extent that they give it the form of law by their assent.' They are not entitled to go any further, and if we make that plain by showing that the grant originated in the only place it could possibly have originated, we have not given way one tittle in regard to our reciprocal rights under sections 53 and 54. That is what the message, which I shall presently read in its fuller form, proposes to do. It may be true that the message that has come down has been framed more with relation to a state of things in one of the States where this power of suggestion has been created by standing orders, than with relation to the exact words of the Federal Constitution. But I do not propose to ask honorable members to haggle about form, when they have matters of substance to consider. I see no difference in principle or in effect between requesting this House to make an amendment and making a suggestion in which this House is requested to concur. Because, if concurrence be asked for, we are requested to make an amendment, and the difference is merely that between tweedledum and tweedledee. There, again, is the danger of our being, led astray by the mere fact if some form of procedure, or. an assimilation to some form of words which has been used on the occasion of certain quarrels, is used in connexion with a message under a Constitution which substantially preserves the rights of the House which makes the suggestion, without encroaching on the rights of- the other House. I do not think it is business-like or constitutional, in the higher sense, for us to string out a debate on a subject of the kind, because we all know that the Senate does not mean to make any encroachment on our rights, and that we do not intend to encroach on the Senate's rights. If we set forth this form of words which makes the matter abundantly clear, I surely think we shall have done our duty to the Senate. The Senate is not a House of Lords ; it is a popular House, as we are. The Senate represents the States, no doubt, as politicial entities, but the electors are exactly the same as the men and women who returned the representatives to this House - there is a difference in the distribution, but not in the personnel of the voters. I do not say that that means that the Senate is to derive undue financial rights, because we know there must* be undoubted financial supremacy in one House, under any Constitution providing for responsible government. But short of that limitation, the fact of the Senate being elected by the people gives them a right which we should be foolish not to recognise, while, at the same time, we must make no surrender of the right of originating ana finally determining supply, without which right no Constitution could proceed under any form where there is responsible government. The message came down to us only at two o'clock, when we met, so that I have not had much time to consider it. I propose to deal with this matter as if the ordinary form of the Constitution as laid down in sections 53 and 54 had been followed word for word. T intend to follow that form, so far as the committee will allow me, in regard to the amendments which the Senate requests, by saying that we agree to two of the requested amendments and make them in the Bill, and that as to the third requested amendment, we have made it with a modification which will appear in the schedule. Throughout I intend to treat the message as one requesting amendment, and that will be a guide for the future. </para>

                        <para>- I use the words "requests for amendments." I emphasize the fact that I wish to use a form of message which will leave no doubt that we are dealing with the matter on absolutely constitutional grounds, and following the forms of the Constitution. I do not think we ought to say we will not accept the form of message sent when we know it means the same thing as the Constitution indicates and requires. I do not think we have any right to interfere unduly with the internal procedure of the other House, any more than the Senate has to interfere with the internal procedure of this House. We might have suggested that they modify the terms of their message by using the word "originate," but I think the Senate recognise that they have no right to interfere with our internal procedure, and I do not think we have any right to dictate to them as to the form of their message when we know what the message is, and what in substance it means. The message I propose reads : - </para>

The words "grant made" are not used in the sense of legally granted, but are used in the sense of a grant that the House of Representatives has determined shall be made. It may be stated that the word " originate " includes the word " made" ; but if we use the word " originated," it cannot be used to mean more than "made," because it is certain that the other House will never agree to the idea that the word " originated " is larger than " made" but rather that it is less than " made.

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).I think the committee may possibly listen for a moment or two to a layman on the subject. Undoubtedly this Bill originated in the House of Representatives, but there was a condition precedent to its origination in this House, namely, that we pass first of all a grant in Committee of Supply. Consequently I think the form of words used in the Bill as it left this House, " For appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives" is perfectly legal and correct, and I cannot see any reason for altering it. But the whole matter appears to me to be one of "words, words, words." There is no question whatever of the undoubted rights of this House being called in question. The rights of the House are not affected; nothing which can be inserted in this preamble will in any way affect the prerogatives and rights of this House to originate taxation Bills. It is for this reason that I suggest that the best way out of the difficulty will be to return the Bill as it left this House, with the exception of the preamble, which we might well strike out altogether. We have it on the authority of the Prime Minister that the whole tendency of modern draftsmanship is to disregard the preamble. The difficulty has arisen by inventing a preamble in which in some absurd way we assert our privileges. I maintain that our rights are embodied in the Constitution, and we may very well rely upon that. The easiest way out of the difficulty will be to return the Bill with a message striking out the preamble, and agreeing to the other two suggestions of the Senate. A most important matter has been referred to by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and that is in regard to the way this message is framed. The Constitution Act says in section 53 that- "The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting by message the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein."

Of course, it is inevitable that there should be colloquial discussion as there is in all 'cases.

There is no suggestion that the recruiting being carried on by those persons was for sugar plantations within the Commonwealth. Under the regulations which govern recruiting for the Queensland plantations, only British subjects.may be employed on the vessels, and an agent of the Government is on board each vessel. </para>

                (Northern Melbourne).I should like to ask the Prime Minister if he has in his mind any arrangement for dealing with the motion standing on the business paper in my name and relating to factory legislation. The right honorable and learned gentleman . was good enough to say last Friday that he would try to find some
                of Government time for dealing with it. I' am being pressed by a number behind who are very much interested in the question, to have the motion brought forward as soon as possible ; and if last Friday's sittings had not been interfered with by the Supply Bill, I should have had an opportunity of submitting the motion.

                    <para>. - It is unfortunate that the motion, has been interfered with, as it has been, by the intervention of public business on Friday, I have already explained, in answer to a question by the honorable member for Wentworth, that I shall be prepared to move to extend the time available on Fridays by beginning earlier ; but there is no sign of congestion in Friday's business, and the two interruptions that have occurred have been accidental. The greater part of yesterday's sitting was occupied with a private member's motion which the Government consented to have heard out of the time otherwise available for public business. When I find that Government business may be likely to terminate at an earlier hour than usual upon any night, if the honorable member for Northern Melbourne will come and see me I will try and make the best arrangement I can. </para>
