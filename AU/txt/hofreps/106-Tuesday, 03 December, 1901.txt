                        <para>- I found yesterday, upon enquiring at some of the warehouse's, that in one case thirteen separate papers had to be signed to pass an entry, and that in another case fourteen had to be signed where formerly only four were necessary. I ascertained also that, in connexion with the importation into Adelaide and exportation to Broken Hill of a parcel valued at 5d., there had to be an entry at Adelaide, and another at Broken Hill, whereas formerly one announcement that the duty had been paid Was sufficient. Another matter to which I w'ish to refer, is that warehousemen used to be allowed to make clearances from their warehouses at - Adelaide, but they are now obliged to make their clearances at Fort Adelaide, and, in order to do so, they have to employ an agent. I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs if he will endeavour to facilitate the work of passing entries, and reduce the number of papers which it is now necessary to sign. </para>

                    <para>- I propose to ask the Government to place cottons and linens, and cotton and linen piece goods, not elsewhere included, upon the free list. I do not intend to deliver a lengthy speech in support of my proposal, because I am persuaded that no set of men such as are here assembled can be ignorant of the very great importance of the articles which are enumerated under the headings to which I refer. They enter very largely into the daily consumption of all classes of the population, and represent some 20 per cent, of the expenditure of the people of Australia. I am very glad that the revenue receipts are exceeding the Treasurer's estimate. The right honorable gentleman, of course, discounts the fact by saying that last month was a very heavy one, and that next month the returns may not be so good ; but no doubt if the returns had been below his estimate, he would have been told by us that it was, therefore, so much the more necessary to keep every item on the Tariff exactly as it stands. Every person in this country must use cotton goods whether they are taxed or not, and, therefore, to put duties of 15 and 10 per cent, upon them is an infamous imposition. We find that under the Victorian Tariff, these articles were admitted free. The Treasurer estimates to receive something like £338,000 from these goods, and whether that is or is not an over-estimate, he should be in a position, in view of the increase in the revenue, to remit that amount. I am sure he is not one who wishes to levy a tax upon the people merely for the sake of taxing them. It cannot be said that there is any chance of growing cotton here. It has been grown experimentally in Queensland, but it has not been a success, nor is it likely to be successful within our time. But the making up of cotton goods from piece goods is an industry which has attained some degree of importance in some of the States. The only objection that can be raised to my proposal is on the ground that it will diminish the revenue. Honorable members opposite are as ready as we are to strike these articles off the list, because the duty on them is really a duty upon raw material. I trust that the Treasurer will regard my proposal in that light. </para>

                        <para>- They are largely made of wool or woollen mixtures. I am willing to vote for a duty on woollen goods, because we are manufacturing from our own wool a very large proportion of the commoner kinds of clothing which the people wear. I do not know whether I can appeal for ratification of this statement to the honorable member for Wentworth, but I believe that nearly, all the wholesale houses of Sydney have their slop goods made out of colonial tweeds. It is a good thing that they do, because although in the majority of instances the tweeds have not the high finish that distinguishes English or New Zealand tweeds, they possess a good wearing quality, and being all wool are likely to give general satisfaction. We should recollect that it is the poor people principally who are compelled by circumstances to wear the commoner and cheaper varieties of cotton clothing. It is a question, not of allowing them to escape taxation, but of adjusting the burdens under which they would be compelled to stagger if the Tariff were carried in its complete form. There is hardly an item of ordinary consumption that is not taxed under the Tariff, and therefore there is the more reason, in my opinion, for removing the duty from items such as cotton piece goods, tea, kerosene, and articles without which the people cannot do. I trust that the committee will see the propriety of eliminating this item. Later on, we can consider what relation the duty on the made up goods should bear to the duty on the raw material. If we should omit the duty of 10 per cent, on cotton piece goods, it would not be necessary I should imagine, to retain such a high duty as 25 per cent, on the made-up article. There is a disposition, I know, amongst some honorable members to place a fairly high duty on cotton piece goods, but I would ask those who have been fulminating against the Tariff throughout the Commonwealth. who have been pointing out its drag-net characteristics, and the fact that it bears so harshly on the great mass of the people - to consider well "before they vote against this amendment, which would undoubtedly have the effect of largely relieving from taxation a class of people who, I think, are the most deserving of our consideration, because of their inability to bear a high impost. </para>

                    <para>- This is a very important item from a revenue stand-point, and as the honorable member for Bland has just mentioned, it is only one of a number of items that are to be attacked, simply because they are revenue items, and are therefore sought to be struck out. It was only the necessities of the case that induced me to propose a dirty on these articles. If I could nave seen my way to allow this class of items to come in free, I should have been only too glad to do so. The honorable member for Bland holds a view entirely different from that which I, as Treasurer, hold with regard to the duty of the Government and of this Parliament towards the States. He seems to think it is not material that we should raise a sufficient sum to keep the States in the position in which they ought to be kept : I do. I believe that the States entered into this Commonwealth on the faith of promises which were made in the convention, and which are practically embodied in the Constitution - that we should take such steps in framing the Tariff as would enable them to be kept in as good a position as they had been in previously. It is all very well for honorable members to say it is the duty of the States to raise whatever may be short in their revenue by some means of direct taxation. In one of the States, the senior State, as my honorable and learned colleague calls it, there is no difficulty. They have plenty of money, plenty of land. </para>

                        <para>- I should like it, sir, to be made clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to run into any kind of debate which will insure that any and every proposal for a reduction of duty shall be debated from the stand-point of its effect on our obligation to sustain the finances of the various States. This is an exceptional case. It is a line which involves some hundreds oE thousands of pounds, .and the broad question whether large reductions or omissions, of such lines will affect that obligation which the Government has always held to, and in which it expects the support of the committee, is one which I think may be considered in dealing with large items of Ibis sort, while it would have no relation to debates on items which involve only small fluctuations of revenue. Th :re, I think, is the dividing line, and if you, sir, agree, the matter may be easily settled. </para>

                        <para>- If, sir, you allow a discussion to take place in this case I &lt; lo not see how you can legitimately prevent one from, taking place upon similar items of the Tariff I certainly think no exception should be made. There are a number of other items to which the arguments used in this case might be applied, and if the Treasurer is to be allowed to make a general statement now, we shall establish a practice which will have to guide us throughout the whole discussion of the Tariff, and which will prove very inconvenient. </para>

We recognise that a certain amount of revenue has to be derived ; that the, bearing of this and some other items upon the financial position of the Commonwealth and of the States is a very important one; and that therefore every latitude should be allowed in the discussion. </para>

                        <para>- The general rule in matters of this kind is to allow a certain amount of latitude to the Minister in charge of a measure. No hard-and-fast rule can be laid down as to what is to ba regarded as relevant or irrelevant, and I am quite willing, so far as I am concerned, to leave it to the Chairman to decide to what extent latitude shall be permitted. I should be very sorry if the Treasurer felt himself in any way cramped in explaining to the House the full effect of any proposal. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely impossible to avoid reference to the effect upon the revenue of many of the items in the Tariff, and if - the Chairman were to rule as has been suggested, and the Treasurer is not able to make such a statement as he was entering upon, the limits of discussion would be seriously restricted. It rests largely upon members to refrain from unnecessary discussion, so that our debates may not be unduly lengthened, or that the privileges accorded to us- may not be abused. The Treasurer was pursuing a perfectly connected line of argument in pointing out that if certain duties were excised we should lose a very large amount of revenue and seriously embarrass the States. The item now before us is eminently one upon which a general discussion of its effects upon the revenue can be raised without any suggestion of irrelevance. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be unfair if the Treasurer were to be prevented from pursuing the line of argument upon which he has entered. We are pointing out the injustice of taxing the manufacturers' raw material, and the only argument that can be used on the opposite side is that the abolition of the dutv will seriously affect the revenue. I think, therefore, that reasonable latitude should be allowed,- and that every member of the committee should have an opportunity of traversing the arguments of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt as to our standing orders, which state that no honorable member shall digress from the subject before the Chair ; but I take it that it would be most inconvenient if the committee were to request the Chairman to give a strict ruling on that point, so far as Ministers in charge of business are concerned. I have endeavoured in the past, with the concurrence of the committee, to allow the Minister in charge of the business to make a general statement, and I have also extended that latitude to the acting leader of the Opposition, to enable him to reply to statements by Ministers. At the same time I have tried to restrict the discussion by other honorable members to the item before the committee. I think that that would be the most convenient course to follow. If I am requested to rule strictly that the Minister is not in order in digressing from the subject before the Chair, I shall he compelled to so rule in every case ; but it has been the practice to allow a certain amount ' of latitude to the Minister in Charge of the business and the leader of the Opposition. If the committee give their concurrence to a general debate they are their own masters, and their decision must guide me. I do not know whether the honorable member for Parramatta desires me to rule strictly now, because if he does I am afraid it will prove most inconvenient. </para>

                    <para>- In your ruling, sir, you stated that it is the practice of the House of Commons and of the Australian State Parliaments to recognise only two parties in the House. . But from my own knowledge I can tell you that that statement is altogether erroneous. In the Queensland Parliament three distinct parties have been recognised for a long time. For five years the so-called labour party, which was two-thirds larger than any other party in the State, was recognised ; but in spite of its numerical strength that party was modest enough to allow the so-called leader of the Opposition to take precedence. I tell this Chamber that if we are not allowed to take a reasonable course, we shall claim our rights as a party, and" if we fail to get them by petition, we shall get them by means of the inherent power of the party. "That is the position which we occupy. There will be no begging and praying on behalf of the labour party in this House while I am a member of that party. It is just as well, now that the question has been raised, that it should, be clearly and definitely laid down what position we occupy. The business of the House cannot proceed without a coalition of both sides, if the labour party is to be ignored. I do not think, sir, that your ruling is well founded, and I deny that it is practicable in a Parliament of this kind. When in Australia a member of the labour party has been called by the constitutional representative of the Crown to form a labour Government, it is rather too late in the day to give a decision of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to say a word before this discussion is finished. The whole idea underlying the granting of permission with concurrence, whether in committee or in the House, to a Minister or to the leader of the Opposition - or, for that matter, to any other representative person - is that the business may be facilitated - that we may ascertain, in a broad general statement, from one individual, what otherwise we should have to spend hours in ascertaining from individual speakers. That idea I do not think is derogated from in the slightest degree by the course suggested, whether the speaker represents the labour party, the country party, the Opposition, or any other body of honorable members. I conceive, with all respect, sir, that it is your duty, so far as the standing orders, will permit, to allow that method to be followed which will conduce to the expedition of business generally. As instancing my feeling in the matter, I may say that the other day, when it was suggested that the acting leader of the Opposition might be allowed to make a statement, I was very strongly in favour of permission being given, because, by that means, we were able approximately to ascertain the opinions of his party, and what then action would be in relation to certain matters. I believe that it will tend to the expedition of business if members, whoever they may be, who .speak on behalf of any section of the House, are allowed a similar latitude. If there is any disposition not to concede this latitude to any other section of the House except the Ministry and the direct Opposition, that will in effect mean that no other party will be allowed similar latitude. I certainly object to the leader of the Opposition speaking for the section of the House with which I am associated. While he very properly is the mouth-piece of those with whom he is directly associated, it would not be proper to take as authoritative what that gentleman may say, so far as honorable members in this section of the House are concerned. I only desire to say that, in my opinion, any person who can speak on behalf of a number of honorable members of the Chamber should, with concurrence, be allowed, equally with the leader of the Opposition, to make a general statement on any matter of importance. </para>

                        <para>- I can see that a difficulty may arise, because when a Ministerial statement was made the other evening, objection was lodged against any reply by the leader of the Opposition. I thought it my duty, although some honorable members tried to prevent me, to ask what course you, sir, would follow if the leader of the country party or the labour party wished to make a similar explanation. I thought it wise that the question should be settled on some definite basis. </para>

If, however, the procedure were ruled by party considerations only, it would only be necessary for a man, in order to be entitled to speak, to detach himself and claim to represent a fifth or a sixth party. </para>

                        <para>- We have not considered this item from a protectionist point of view. It may be that in some parts of Queensland cotton can be grown, and cotton and linen goods can be manufactured. But while a successful attempt has been made in that State by the granting of a bonus to cultivate cotton, the industry may perhaps be looked upon from a stand-point similar to that of the iron industry. There is no certainty that the mere imposition of a 10 per cent, duty would enable it to succeed, and - as in connexion with the iron industry - it would _ not be right to attempt to establish it simply by a protective duty. It should be dealt with in a manner somewhat similar to that in which we are dealing with the iron industry. Therefore we regard this item merely from a revenue standpoint. Honorable members will realize that the Government have no desire to impose revenue duties for the mere pleasure of doing so. It is no pleasure to any Government to take more money out of the pockets of the taxpayer than they consider is absolutely necessary, for the purpose of enabling them to carry on their administrative functions. This is one of the items which the Government, with some reluctance, have included in the Tariff from revenue considerations. When honorable, members look at the large amount which it is proposed to derive from it, they must realize the seriousness of striking it out altogether, and thereby depriving the Treasurer of, probably, £300,000 - an amount which I believed at the time the Budget was made, and still believe, will be necessary to properly carry on the services of the Commonwealth. We have heard a good deal in regard to the immense amount which the Tariff is going to yield. We have been told that it will yield us £12,000,000 annually. If honorable members hold that view, they will be very much disappointed when the Treasurer makes his financial statement next year. I defy any man to accurately calculate the revenue which this Tariff will produce. It was difficult to correctly gauge the revenue of any particular State under a Tariff in connexion with which the Treasurer and his officers had had many years of experience. Much more difficult is it to calculate the revenue for the whole Commonwealth, containing as it does six States with varying circumstances, and working under conditions which are entirely new. The Government have agreed that the value of the imports upon which duties can: be levied, will represent a certain amount. I have been accused of largely reducing that amount in . order to enable heavy protective duties to be levied upon certain goods, and at the same time I am told that the heavier the duties the less will be the revenue received from them. Honorable members, therefore, will, acquit me of any desire to mislead the committee by stating anything which I do not believe to be absolutely accurate. I say, unhesitatingly, that we cannot take the revenue of any two months as a guide to what this Tariff will produce. The circumstances at the present time are quite abnormal. We cannot take the receipts for a month under any Tariff, multiply them by twelve, and say that the amount- thus produced represents the probable revenue for the year. Time alone will tell, whether any mistake has been made in the calculations which have been submitted to the House. But a grave responsibility rests upon the Government, and particularly upon myself in the capacity of Treasurer, to see that a fair amount of revenue is derived - an amount which we believe will enable us. to meet all the demands that are likely to be made upon us. ' We must look not merely to the obligations which we have to meet immediately. If we do our duty to the Commonwealth we must have an eye to the future, and realize the responsibilities which face us. We must not only provide sufficient revenue for this year, or even for next year, but it is our solemn duty to recognise the position in which we shall find ourselves if we do not raise an amount sufficient to meet all our obligations. This morning I endeavoured to jot down a few items of expenditure which are not included in the Estimates for this year, but which within two or three years at the outside will have to be dealt with. I feel bound to place these matters before honorable members before they decide to take away from the Government this large sum of money which it is proposed to collect by way of a revenue duty. Of course, I freely admit that it is within the province of the committee to say that they will not grant the amount required, or will provide it by some other means. But, if they decide that the money is not required, the responsibility must rest with them. It is my duty, however, to place before them the information at my disposal, so that they may be able to do what is right and proper in the interests of the Commonwealth. In addition to the provision which has already been made in the Estimates, large sums of money will require to be provided by the Commonwealth within a very brief period indeed. The first large expenditure has reference to the properties which have been transferred by the various States to the Commonwealth, or which have become vested in it under the Constitution. In this connexion a claim has been made on behalf of the States, and strongly supported, that the Commonwealth, having taken over these properties, is bound to pay for them. If we have to pay upon them the amount of interest which is thought to be fair, namely, 3£ per cent., we shall have to provide each year a sum of £350,000, setting down the value of the properties at £10,000,000. </para>

                        <para>-We have arrived now at a very important position, and I have considered it my bounden duty to place the facts before the committee from my point of view, in order that they may be able to judge whether they are justified in taking from the Treasurer the large amount which it is proposed to take from him by striking out this item. I can only say that while at the present time we have ample revenue to carry us on, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that, sooner or later, we shall have large amounts to provide for, which, in my opinion, will come to from £1,000,000 to £1,250,000.- This is merely a revenue item, and I could understand an objection to it from the point of view of the manufacturers. It is one of the duties that we have felt bound to impose on the manufacturing industry, while at the same time reducing the measure of protection which they have had in this and perhaps in some of the other States. However, from a revenue point of view, we considered that we were bound to try and raise this money. We admitted the difficulty of dealing with this particular class of goods at duties of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent., and we then proposed to make the duties 10 per cent, all round, leaving out some exemptions which we had previously desired to provide for. That would make some difference in the revenue to be derived from this particular class of imports. I can understand that honorable members might desire to somewhat reduce our proposals. We are all anxious to give a fair measure of support to those industries which have already been established. We can injure an industry by reducing the amount of direct protection to it, and by increasing the amount which the manufacturers have to pay for their raw material. With regard to this particular class of goods and manufactured articles, we are probably doing both ; but, as I have said, it is only a sense of necessity that has compelled us to impose these duties. Realizing as I do the responsibility of my position, nothing I know or have heard of has removed from my mind a sense of the necessity of raising a considerable amount of money from these and similar revenue duties. I consider I have done my duty. I have proposed them, and I have endeavoured to place before the committee such facts as are within my knowledge, to show that these duties should not be altogether removed. With regard to this particular item, while I could not agree to the removal of the duty or to the suggestion that it should be 5 per cent., I have been willing as in connexion with previous items to try and meet the difficulties which manufacturers complain of, in not having a sufficient margin of protection, and to meet also the statements which have been made with regard to this duty bearing too hardly upon many amongst us. I am prepared, therefore, if the committee entertain the suggestion that there should be some reduction upon the present proposal of the Government, to accept a reduction ; but I do not think that the duty should be removed altogether, because I think all classes of the community ought to pay something towards the revenue we must raise. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt they will, but we all have to pay something. I propose a duty of 7£ per cent, as a compromise, and I think that would not be too much to ask as a contribution from those who use this particular class of goods, while it possibly may give a better measure of protection to those who manufacture the made-up Article. I have felt bound to place . before honorable members the seriousness of the position. I quite admit that no man can foretell the effect of the Tariff from a revenue point of view, but I repeat what I said in my Budget statement, that we must be extremely cautious - that if we are to err we ought to err on the side of caution. If, after the experience of a year or two of the operation of the Tariff, we find from practical knowledge that it is producing more money than was anticipated, or is necessary, no one will be more willing than I to assist in removing these mere revenue duties. Holding the position I do, and viewing the other items which have yet to be considered, I cannot consent to all the reductions proposed in connexion with this item. I have placed the matter from my point of view before the committee, and it is for honorable members to decide whether they will be guided by the Treasurer, or whether they will refuse to give him what he considers to be a reasonable amount of money with which to carry on the business of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I am very glad that the right honorable gentleman has made this very elaborate exposition of his policy. He is now pleading for revenue, but we have passed a division involving £1,141,000, and on nearly every item of that division I cautioned the Government that the duties proposed were prohibitory, and that they were recklessly throwing revenue to the winds. I told the right honorable gentleman that the prohibitory character of the Tariff was absolutely killing his revenue resources, but we never heard a word about revenue before. It is only now after these duties have been passed involving taxation to the extent of £1,141,000 that we hear a word at all about the revenue aspect of the case. When we said we agreed to raise revenue without destruction we were simply jeered at. I tell my right honorable friend that I do not feel inclined to support a duty of 'this kind pressing so hardly upon the whole population of Australia, and especially upon the labouring population, when no consideration has been given to the other items to which I have referred. Besides that, those of us who demanded certain reductions may take the credit of swelling the revenue under this last division, for every item we reduce means thousands and thousands of pounds extra revenue to the Treasury. We have not yet finished with these items, and it is very hard to say whether a very considerable portion of the revenue which the right honorable gentleman expects to receive from these items will not now be received, in consequence of the reductions we have made. If there is not a larger revenue to be obtained from the previous division, it is the fault of the Government for not keeping their compact to introduce moderate protection, for attempting to carry prohibitive duties, as honorable members on the other side have candidly admitted, to keep out the importations. We do not get any fair play at all from a certain section of the committee, and perhaps the members of that section will be able to justify the Government in this proposal. According to the comparative statement placed before us I find that these linen and cotton goods were free in Victoria. ' Perhaps those honorable members will be able to justify the position of the Government in that respect. The duty upon them was 5 per cent in Queensland, in South Australia they were free, and in Tasmania the duty was 20 per cent. New South Wales has one- third of the population of the Commonwealth, Victoria another third, and there is South Australia with her proportion. According to this comparative statement, the larger populations of Australia have followed a policy which is against any duty upon these goods. There are one or two other considerations I would like to place before honorable members. If we put a high duty on these cottons we must put a correspondingly high duty upon the manufactured articles, and if we begin high at the base we shall be absolutely committed to the higher duties later on. If we put an extensive duty upon cotton "goods, which cannot be manufactured in Australia, where will be the scientific protection, and where will be our sense of equity when we come to deal with the woollen goods ? If we impose heavy protective duties upon the goods of one manufacturer, we must level up all the others, and I am anxious that in dealing with this matter we should commence upon a proper basis. I admit that the revenue aspect of the duties must be considered, and I have been divided in opinion between the expediency of placing cotton goods upon the free list, and imposing a 5per cent, duty upon them ; but in view of the character of the Tariff so far - a great many of the duties which have been imposed having been intended to shut out all importations of the articles upon which they are imposed - and as I shall be very glad if the Government have to review it and go back upon their work, I shall vote for the amendment, and the placing of these goods upon the free list. In coming to this decision I am also guided by what I must consider the public opinion of the States in regard to the treatment of these articles, and, as I have shown, they have generally been on the free list. While I admit that under ordinary circumstances they would be fairly open to the imposition of a revenue duty, we must remember that we are dealing now with a highly protectionist Tariff, and that the proposed duties are duties upon raw material. If we begin by putting duties upon raw material, we shall be forced, when we come to the consideration of duties upon made-up material to impose higher duties than are reasonable. The policy , of Victoria has been to relieve these goods from taxation, and, seeing that we have hitherto heard so much about the Victorian Tariff, we should require very strong reasons from the Government for, in this instance, departing from the policy of Victoria. It might be said by honorable members in favour of these duties that it is impossible without them to obtain the necessary amount of revenue. But it should be borne in mind that there will be no difficulty in making up the revenue without them. </para>

I should like to see a review of the Tariff if sufficient revenue cannot be obtained under it. If we cannot get sufficient revenue, the best thing to do will be to recommit division 4, and go back upon the protectionist policy under which, in breach of the compact made, by the Government, prohibitory duties have been imposed in certain instances. </para>

                    <para>- I think it is very unfair for the Treasurer to tack on to an item of this kind expenditure which will probably have to be met during the next five or ten years, as though the £338,000 which it is estimated that these duties will return is to be ear-marked to meet that expenditure. I am rather surprised that the right honorable member should admit the inability of the Government to obtain the necessary revenue without a tax upon these goods, seeing that, although he took charge of the affairs of the State of Victoria when it was nearly insolvent, he was able to pull the State out of that condition without a tax upon cotton goods. From the three States under whose Tariffs these goods were formerly admitted free, he expects to obtain from the proposed duties about£254,000 of the total£338,000 of revenue, which he expects to get from the whole Commonwealth. Therefore, new taxation to that amount is imposed - I submit unnecessarily - upon the people of those three States. I do not wish to repeat the arguments of the acting leader of the Opposition as to the probable increase of revenue to be obtained by the lowering of the duties which has already taken place, and the changes which may occur before consideration of the Tariff is concluded. Neither the Treasurer nor any one else has said anything in favour of these duties. The right honorable member admitted that they were undesirable, but he did not prove that we could not do without them. The argument that they will produce a large amount of revenue is one which should induce honorable members to vote for the amendment, because it is a proof that the tax will press upon the great mass of the people, and will have to be borne chiefly by those who can least afford to bear it. The Treasurer spoke about the necessity for providing for the needs of the States. If any of the States are left short of revenue, they must resort to direct taxation to make up the deficiency, and if they do that, the taxation will press upon a class which is able to bear it. The Treasurer, however, would have us save that class by putting the taxation upon those who are least able to bear it. Poor people will have to buy cotton goods, because they are cheap, although they may not be the most desirable articles of wear, and by imposing a duty upon these goods the Treasurer practically reduces their wages, and makes life harder for them, in order to save the richer classes from direct taxation, which they would be able to bear. Of course, the Treasurer must be on the safe side in regard to the probabilities of obtaining revenue, but the proposals of the Government are not the best for raising revenue, and the particular items which have been referred to this afternoon are certainly items which should be placed upon the free list. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment to omit these two items is defended on several grounds. First, we are told that the revenue is exceeding the estimate to such an extent that there is occasion for us to shorten the source of supply so that we shall not have too much, but we have not had the least evidence submitted to justify that assertion. In a ' Melbourne newspaper yesterday there was a statement made which to-day it has practically withdrawn, and unless there is some better ground than that to go on that argument may be dismissed. The honorable member for Darling argued that because the State Treasurers have not resorted to this item, therefore there is no need for the Commonwealth Treasurer to do so. Several States have not resorted to the item lately, but the fact of the matter is that owing to our inter-State freetrade and to other policies which have been carried out in this Tariff, there is a necessity to resort to goods "which have not hitherto paid taxes in order to raise the necessary revenue. And when we find that this line is estimated to yield £330,000 - and in Tasmania it means about one-twentieth part of the estimated revenue - willing as I should be to relieve those least able te bear taxation, I am utterly unable to vote for the amendment. We are also told that it is most improper to tax these articles, because they are used by every one. I should have thought, from a free-trade stand-point, that an article which was used by every one must be the fairest source from which to get a revenue. Then we are told by ari honorable member that no one who could afford to use wool would use cotton. But if he had looked at the shop windows in Bourke-street he would have seen plenty of evidence that it is not the poorer classes alone who wear cotton goods, but that cotton and linen enter very largely into the clothing of those who are quite able to pay, and should pay, a good share of the taxation under this item. For these reasons I am unable to vote for a reduction of the proposed duty of 10 per cent. I think, looking to all the facts, we shall need this revenue ; we shall certainly need it in Tasmania. I do not think that this Parliament ought to take up the position of directing a State's policy in regard to taxation. We have to do what is right for the Commonwealth, but I do not think we ought so to act as to force on the State Parliaments any policy of taxation. In Tasmania, without a reduction of £15,000 as is proposed, the position is such that the Treasurer has been seriously considering whether he should not bring in income tax proposals which would reach as low down as those receiving only £80 a year. There is a serious position for us to face if this revenue is very much interfered with. </para>

If I did not do sol should be recreant to the position I took up in the State Legislature in relation to a proposition I made to strike off the duty on apparel and articles of attire. I cannot see how any one who poses as a democrat can introduce a duty which, in respect to four States, is practically new. In some 'States these articles have been admitted 'free of duty. In one State they bore - I believe, up to the inauguration of the Commonwealth - a mistaken protectionist duty of 5 per cent. And in timid Tasmania, where they are always afraid of _ fl__ getting bankrupt, they bore a duty of 20 per cent, for revenue purposes. </para>

                    <para>- I shall not allude to the figures put forward by the Treasurer, because I do not think that they quite place that responsibility on this committee which the Treasurer desires to impose upon us. Some weeks ago I was one of those who expressed the opinion that we should be content with some £800,000 or £900,000 less revenue than the Treasurer was asking for, and the only way in which I can emphasize my opinion is by reducing duties in some direction or other. The Government have successfully resisted all attempts to reduce the duties imposed for protective purposes, but even if we had been able to effect reductions, no loss ' of revenue would have resulted, but rather the contrary. I have already stated that this Tariff presses too heavily in several directions upon the poorer classes, and upon the primary industries of the community, and whilst I cannot go so far as some honorable members desire in giving relief in one direction only, because I wish also to afford it in other ways, I can join with them to a considerable extent in lightening the burdens of the poorer classes, as we shall not minimize the revenue by lessening the protective duties. That must be done by reducing some of the revenue duties. It then rests with us to make a selection of the revenue duties upon which reductions should be made. I cannot go as far as some honorable members would wish, because I think they are proceeding to an extent that would not be justifiable in view of the financial requirements of the Commonwealth. I am ready, however, to support the amendment, because by abolishing the duty on cotton goods we shall not only give relief to the poorer classes, but also get rid of a lot of Custom-house complications, and help those who largely use cotton materials in industrial operations. If we were to abolish the duty on tea we should probably give no greater relief than by placing cotton and linen goods on the free list. Tea presents no difficulties to the Custom-house authorities, and is not used in any industrial operations, and, therefore, stands upon an entirely different footing to cotton goods. For these reasons I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for West Sydhev. </para>

                    <para>- It gives me great pleasure to be able to vote for the relief of the working men and women of the Commonwealth from what I consider a limited amount of persecution. I firmly believe that these duties are nothing more nor less than whips and spurs for the hips and backs of the democracy of Australia. The working people frequently have large families, and are developing the country; and they pay heavily through the Customhouse, while the rich, who generally have small families, pay less. I admit that this taxation will affect Tasmania, but the question arises whether I am here as a special pleader for the Government of that State. If the Government of Tasmania are incapable of meeting their responsibilities without salting the backs of the workers on the west coast, they ought to retire, and allow abler men to undertake the re-adjustment of the incidence of taxation. The whole financial system in this country is rotten to the core ; but when we have a proper system of taxation, based on the equality of sacrifice, those who have much shall pay much, and those who have little shall pay little. A similiar trouble arose in the States of Canada, where the cry was - "Will you persecute the States " ? But when the States realized their responsibilities and re-adjusted their systems of taxation, the burden was spread over the whole of the people in proportion to their wealth. It is the poor man who pays all. He buys in the smallest quantities, and has, therefore, to pay the highest price, which may amount to 25 per cent., or 30 per cent, more than , is paid by the rich man, who buys in large quantities.. It is the working man who keeps going the small towns, because, unlike the rich, he is unable to get to the big cities and buy his goods wholesale. Whenever I have an. opportunity, protectionist as I am, I shall, consider the stragglers and endeavourers who are developing this country. </para>

Originally we specified the poorer articles at 10 per cent., allowing all others to come in as "n.e.i.," at the higher rate. The poorer articles comprise blue frocking, butter and cheese cloth, calico - white and grey, drills, duck, dungaree, jeans, moleskins, oil baize, leather cloth, sheetings (including Forfar, dowlas, and flax), shirtings - white, Oxford, Cambridge and Harvard, ticks, towellings, window-nets and hollands.

                        <para>- There are cottons of various characters, and it is a question of classification in order to arrive at a fair thing. The Government have never concealed in the slightest degree from honorable members their desire to avoid taxes which can be fairly avoided, particularly those which press too hardly on the poor. There are three or four rates of duties provided for in the Tariff in connexion with which we should be only too glad to afford relief if we could do so ; and not once or twice, but several times has the Government put that position before honorable members. Speaking on the 14-th November, the Treasurer said - </para>

                    <para>There are a number of items, such as tea, rice, kerosene, and cotton goods, which are looked upon as practically only revenue duties, and it will he a matter for our consideration whether we shall not ask the committee to deal first with, the rest of the Tariff, in order that we may see how it is finally settled, allowing these four large revenue-producing items to stand over. In the meantime we shall have some experience of the revenue-producing power of the other items, and that will guide us in asking the House to take a certain course in regard to the purely revenue-producing items I have mentioned. </para>

                <para>It has always been the wish of the Government, in regard to these items, particularly kerosene and tea, which are purely revenue producing lines, to do what we canto relieve the poorer classes from the burden which will be cast on them. We deliberately postponed the consideration . of tea in order to let honorable members have the fullest information on the subject. Honorable members would be sorry if by a hasty dealing with any one of these items, without considering it in connexion with others, we decided on a certain course which prevented or raised difficulty in the way of our dealing with other items as liberally as we might wish. There are various claims for consideration in connection with these rival items, and the claims in connexion with tea, have much to recommend them. Tea is admitted free into America. </para>

                        <para>- But I am talking on the question of dealing. with some considerable line in the Tariff for the purpose of relieving the duties which fall on the poor. Tea is consumed by rich and poor, and the poor man's tea, unfortunately, will pay the same rate of duty as that of higher quality which is used by the rich. But taking the three items of tea, kerosene, and cotton goods, are we prepared to say at this moment that we will entirely abandon taxation on cotton goods, knowing full well that as a result it will be more difficult to deal with the other items as liberally as we might desire? If we remit or remove a large amount of taxation here, Ave cannot to the same extent remove or remit when we come to the other items. It would be wise for us, in this general connexion, to consider what is best to be done in regard to these three items, rather than hurriedly come to a conclusion to deal with the first without considering the claims of the others, and prejudice, as we must, claims to relaxation made in respect of the latter. I put this position all the more . strongly for the reason that the leader of the Opposition contended that if we relaxed taxation in the way suggested he would show how it could be made up in some of the postponed items, and also pointed to the possibility of doing that in regard to some items which we had already passed. What items have we postponed or proposing to postpone? Tea undoubtedly was one, and kerosene was another ; and if the words of the acting leader of the Opposition mean anything they mean that if we take the tax off cotton goods there can be no relaxation in regard to tea and kerosene, but, on the other hand, rather higher duties. </para>

                        <para>- We have a certain proposal in regard to tea and kerosene, but we are deliberately suggesting that that should be postponed for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not we can remit duties in this connexion. I ask honorable members generally not to hurriedly decide on this general relaxation. Would it not be infinitely preferable that this item should be postponed for consideration in connexion with other items at which we shall shortly arrive? At the least when it is proved beyond the possibility of doubt that the classes of goods which the honorable member proposes to strike out, include goods standing in two different categories, do not let us adopt any rash mode of applying the arguments which operate in the one case to that of the other. Here I may say that I am now in the happy position of being able to answer a question which has been asked regarding the relative value of the two classes of goods. The goods upon which we proposed to levy a duty of 10 per cent, are valued at £1,040,000, whilst those upon which we proposed a 15 percent, impost represent a value of £1,560,000. I am inclined to think that honorable members generally are disposed to do a fair thing. They know also that the Government wish to do a fair thing. If the financial conditions were such that we could dispense with a revenue duty in this case, we should be only too glad to adopt that course. Our whole attitude in connexion with this Tariff has been to seek opportunities for remitting duties in connexion with all reasonable claims to exemption. Those claims relate chiefly to three great items, namely, kerosene, tea, and cotton goods. Are honorable members prepared to say that they will exempt cotton goods from duty, notwithstanding the fact that those which we propose to tax at the higher rate represent an aggregate value of 50 per cent, more, and that we are told in so many words that the way to make up the deficit is by retaining the duty upon kerosene and tea, and increasing it if necessary ? I venture to put it that the position is somewhat extraordinary. We have heard of reversals of form. It is not unnatural to speak of them in such a country as this, but of all the reversals of form ever heard of that of the acting leader of the Opposition is the greatest, and I invite the attention of the parliamentary stewards to it at once in order that he may be rubbed out for ever. Throughout the length and breadth of this Tariff discussion the cry of the honorable member has been that we should consider the duties levied from the point of view of revenue. I have looked at them from the revenue stand-point, and also from the stand-point of the opportunity which they would give our people to earn something. But now we come to an item when the question involved is not one of employment, but  of revenue only. Yet the honorable member stands up and says in effect - " Away with the revenue. Down with the idea. Here is £350,000 which can be struck off at one fell blow, and I am prepared to strike that blow." In such circumstances, when the honorable member rises in future to talk about such trifling considerations as £20,000 or £30,000 it will be our duty to remind him that he was prepared to sacrifice £350,000 in direct defiance of the principles which he so eloquently advocated. The Government are with honorable members in regard to their democratic wish to avoid harsh dealing with the poor. It is not as if we were setting up this claim for the first time. It is consistent with our principles throughout. Our every action shows it. There are. items which have been reserved for final decision ; and I ask whether we are now hurriedly going to say that the noses of the poor shall be held to the grindstone. I venture to think that honorable members will not come to such a conclusion, but that they will prefer to deal with those items by classes which will properly separate the goods of the poor from those of the rich, and to leave matters relating to their clothes, their light, or their breakfast table, to be considered and dealt with at the one time. </para>

The only reversal of form of which I know is that the acting leader of the Opposition during this debate has undoubtedly evinced an attitude of intense sympathy with the poor struggling working people, and has in season and out of season striven to diminish the burdens which they are asked to bear as the result of federation. On the other hand, the Minister for Trade and Customs has embraced every opportunity to make it impossible to lighten those burdens. </para>

                        <para>- There is no better judge of cant in this House than is the honorable member. The Government are merely anxious to postpone the consideration of these items in order that they may ascertain the attitude of the committee, in regard to the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who wishes to further increase the burdens of the people. Their policy is a most easy way of sweeping aside all considerations of revenue. No more reprehensible course than that adopted by the Treasurer this afternoon has ever been taken in any Parliament. The right honorable gentleman came down whilst the committee were deliberating upon an item in committee, and made another financial statement. He interposed upon a certain item, and endeavoured to show that the federal expenditure is piling up so enormously that it .is absolutely necessary for the committee to give him all the revenue which is asked for. His action was a deliberate attempt to influence the debate in a way that has never been attempted before. I should not have objected to his statement if it had not been made for the purpose of morally coercing the committee into giving him the revenue which he seeks. In my judgment these articles ought to be placed upon the free list. They are articles of common consumption and of common necessity, and' though a Tariff is a good deal moulded by circumstances and not by our voluntary choice, we ought in these circumstances so to frame our Tariff as to give some relief in respect of those articles which enter largely into the every - day life of working people. Notwithstanding what has been said by the Minister for Trade and Customs, I venture to assert that the items now under discussion will affect the working people of the Commonwealth more than the middle classes and people who are well to do. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports has indicated that he is going to propose increases upon items which are to come on for consideration later. But no matter what the honorable member may propose in the way of prohibitive duties subsequently, we ought to do our best to have these articles placed on the free list, or to have the duties placed upon them as low as possible. There is no danger so far as the revenue is concerned, because happily the revenue may be said to be overflowing-, and considerations of that kind ought not to make us yield one inch in our persistent advocacy of the remission of duties upon articles largely used by the working people of the community. </para>

It must, therefore, be clear to the official and expert mind that it is possible to discriminate between them. </para>

Cotton and linen piece goods were free before, but we have had certain representations made as to the necessity for revenue, and the committee have been told that other items, such as tea and kerosene, have been specially postponed in order to see how all will hang together in the production of revenue. Tea is an article of general use, but only a section of the industrial population use kerosene, while the whole of our poorer classes will use the class of clothing to which I have referred. </para>

If we take " shirtings, " I suppose the same stuff could be made into shirts or into anything else, and what is to hinder a row between the Customs officials and the' importers as to whether the goods should be on this list or charged duty under the item, " cotton and linen piece goods, n.e.i. "? If there is going to be an agreement to get revenue out of these items at all it would be far better to charge 5 per cent, on the whole. I am not going to budge from any position, but if there is a feeling that the exemption of all these goods is going too far, in the name of common sense do not let us differentiate between them. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable gentleman thinks he is doing his best to create industries in the duties in connexion with which he has sacrificed revenue, but we ask what is the good of creating an industry if you are to impose a prohibitive duty to help 100 people and injure 1,000,000 ? I have pointed out that this Tariff has not been arranged scientifically from a trade point of view. We have to deal first with the piece goods, and then with the intermediate goods between the piece goods and what is called "apparel." That is to say, under this there would be things like table-cloths. </para>

No man has a greater grasp of detail than has the right honorable member, but if the Tariff is framed upon the lines that he proposes, it would require an angel from heaven to understand it, and a Customhouse officer would have to be an expert in every trade under the sun to properly perform his functions.

                        <para>- We cannot make a. bargain of that sort, because either the duty is right and should be imposed, or there should be no duty. .But, to facilitate business, I am willing to divide my amendment in the way I suggest. I agree with the acting leader of the Opposition that it is almost impossible to distinguish between piece goods and the cottons and linens enumerated above. I have here a sample of dress-lining which the Custom-house officials, who are assumed to be able to discriminate between cotton and linen piece goods and other cotton goods, declare to be apparel, although it has hitherto come in asa minor article. The same officials declare an ordinary hat-pin to be jewellery, and charge 25 per cent, duty upon it. These uncertainties and ambiguities do more harm to trade than the Tariff itself, and it is therefore- important that people should know exactly what goods are dutiable and what are not. </para>

                        <para>- The desire of the Government is to obtain a reasonable amount of duty from these items, and to show that I was willing to meet the committee, I said that we were prepared to accept a duty of 7£ per cent, all round. It has been pointed out with some force that the poorer class of goods ought not to bear as high a duty as the better class. We had that opinion when we framed the Tariff, as honorable members will see ; but some difficulties arose in connexion with the working: of the particular items, and to obviate them, we offered to make the duty 10 per cent.. all round. Although there will be difficulties in the administration, still they arise in every Tariff, and from time to time have to be, and are, overcome. Under these circumstances I shall raise no objection to the honorable member for West Sydney testing the feeling of the Committee as to putting the particular items he mentions on the free list, and afterwards we can take a. vote as to remaining items, and then I hope,, as we have shown a desire to meet the committee with regard to the poorer class items, it will allow us to have a duty of 10 percent, on the other items, which will give us a fair amount of revenue from the better class of goods. </para>

I think it would be possible by recommittal to secure the enumeration of a great proportion of those articles which we know are of a higher value. An honorable member showed me a set of words which would enumerate the goods which are not articles of apparel or attire, but which are all cotton, silk or jute, or combinations of both. </para>

                    <para>- I shall vote to place on the free list the articles under the heads of " cottons and linens," from " blue frocking " down to " hollands," because, judging from the State Tariffs, it is a fair thing to do. I am prepared to consider the other matter afterwards. I may say, in reply to the Minister for Trade and Customs, that I give very much more consideration to these items than to either tea or kerosene, because they are very largely used by the great bulk of the people. While we cannot differentiate so as to say that the wealthier classes shall not use them, we know that cottons and linens enter considerably more into the cost of keeping a household than does either tea or kerosene. I hope I shall not be accused of making a protectionist speech when I say that in putting such articles on the free list we shall assist a very large number of female workers, and if any class of manufacturing employes require assistance, the weakest of the number are deserving of consideration, does not apply to tea or kerosene. Therefore we are not only giving an opportunity to poor people to procure these goods at first cost, but we are also offering additional facilities to the sempstress and others who are engaged in making up the raw material. It is this class of workers who have received less consideration than any others under the Tariff. With regard to the other suggestions that have been made, I feel confident that the Government will be prepared to review their proposals. </para>

                    <para>- I am very much surprised at many honorable members who profess to be protectionists endeavouring to fasten a duty upon articles which are the raw materials for many of our manufactures. An attempt is being made to impose an unnecessarily high tax upon the people. These duties of 10 and 15 per cent, are equivalent to 2s. and 3s. in the £. If the protectionists take up the view that these duties are necessary for revenue purposes, we reply that the revenue which the Government are attempting to raise is far too large. It may not  be too large from the point of view of some of the States, but we are legislating here for the Commonwealth, and have to study the interests of the entire community. This impost deserves the serious attention of honorable members. Protectionist members, knowing that the freetraders in the House were determined to cut down this taxation, have for once joined with us, and may thus obtain credit, which properly belongs to our party, for lessening the amount of duty. I have heard from the protectionists no discussion of this matter from the manufacturers' point of view, and I should like to know why our friends opposite have lost all their solicitude for that class to which they usually devote their attention. If one class of manufacturer is entitled to have blue frocking brought in as raw material, then other manufacturers are entitled to have their raw material admitted free. What surprises me, from a protectionist point of view, is that cotton should be placed on the free list, when we are informed that protection is wanted for the woollen manufacturer, and that cotton goods come largely into competition with woollens. From the point of view I have indicated, cottons ought to be subject to a duty of perhaps 30 per cent., seeing that such a duty would deprive the people of the chance of buying cotton materials, and would greatly increase employment in the woollen industry. It is interesting to hear from protectionists the admission that the tax is paid by the people here, because that shows that, having listened to our arguments, they have been converted to our point of view. This item is of the greatest importance to the community, and it would be a mistake to pass it without discussion. Figures showing the consumption of these goods ought to have been furnished by the Treasurer, because, with such information, we should have been in a much better position to discuss the general question as to how the revenue is affected. It may be that the revenue will be considerably interfered with, and yet we are voting to a considerable degree in the dark. It is no part of the duty of ari Opposition member to help the Government in framing a Tariff, seeing that we do not believe in customs duties, and I shall certainly support the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt if we could firmly establish the cotton industry in Queensland it would be a very good thing for the Commonwealth, but it appears to be the feeling of the committee that the particular articles which are used by the poorer people should be placed upon the free list. That being so, I regret that we cannot see our way to support the honorable member's amendment. I have seen some of the articles which were manufactured in the northern State some years ago, and I know that the expert opinion formed of them was very favorable indeed. Though I do not think the honorable member has. any chance of inducing the committee- to place a high duty upon these articles he may fairly claim favorable consideration at our hands when we are endeavouring to establish various industries by the granting of bonuses. I am aware that there are a number of articles to the growth of which Queensland and the Northern Territory are peculiarly adapted, and the cultivation of which, if properly assisted, might develop into large industries. Therefore, whilst sympathizing with the object of the honorable member, I advise him not to press the amendment. "When we are dealing with the question of bonuses we shall give as favorable consideration as is possible to the industry which he has named. </para>

                    <para>- I speak with considerable diffidence upon a subject which requires technical knowledge, but on the general question I am of opinion that the Treasurer is entitled to expect a considerable amount of revenue from these goods. I am therefore prepared to support a proposal in favour of an equal duty of 5 per cent, upon them all. I have learned from those who are in the trade and know the business thoroughly, that this proposed differentiation is likely to lead to considerable complications. The Treasurer informs us that under the proposal now made he will receive practically the same revenue, but if the acting leader of the Opposition is prepared to test the question, I should prefer to vote for a uniform duty of 5 per cent, on the goods, included in both these items, believing that it would be in the interests of the Treasury, that it would facilitate the collection of the duties and avoid a diversity of customs decisions, while at the same time it would not be imposing a too heavy burden upon the community. </para>

                        <para>- We have in several instances applied duties to a number of articles in common consumption, but I think that, where possible, we should exempt such articles from duty, and should impose duties only upon things in the nature of luxuries. </para>

                    <para>- The Treasurer has stated that the Government expected to get about £350,000 of revenue from the item as originally framed. The honorable member for West Sydney says that he has voluntarily given up two-fifths of that amount. As a matter of fact the amount of revenue given up is not as much as two fifths of the original estimate. The Treasurer, has, however, announced that he will allow certain articles, which have been named, and similar articles that may be brought under his notice, to be put upon the free list ; but he has frankly informed the committee that he cannot afford to lose the whole of the revenue that may be expected from this item. That he has given up £100,000 or £125,000 of revenue, is no reason why he should give up the whole £.350,000. The honorable member for West Sydney says that the action of the Treasurer is not that of a man who is hard up, and he proposes to make him hard up by taking the remaining £200,000 from him. I would have the greatest pleasure in placing all these things on the free list. Protectionists and free-traders alike are in accord on that point ; it is only revenue tariffists who would place duties upon such articles. But during the debate on the address in reply and upon the Budget, it was constantly reiterated that the Commonwealth must raise a large amount of revenue through the Customs. It has been said that by placing protective duties upon certain articles we have lost the chance of getting as much revenue as we might otherwise have obtained ; but my answer to that is that, if those duties had not been imposed, a large number of men would have been thrown out of employment. In consideration of the attitude which the Ministry has taken up in regard to previous items, I feel bound in honour to support them now. I know the difficulty which is raised about discrimination. I dare say that a duty of 5 per cent, all round on these two lines would have meant far less trouble in the practical working of the Tariff than there is at present, but we also know that the committee would not have agreed to its imposition. It is not so fair, just as the Government's second proposal of a 10 per cent, duty all round was not so fair as their original proposal for a duty of 10 per cent, on one line and 15 per cent, on the other. Although it is probable that the " n.e.i." class will be found to include some items of common use, still I think that the list of special exemptions includes the great bulk of the articles in common use, and what is left in the "n.e.i." class will not be more than those which will fairly cast on the less wealthy portion of the community such a burden of taxation in proportion to their means as I admit would have been cast on them by the original proposal. If the understanding with the Government to impose a 10 per cent, duty on this class be carried, we shall sacrifice a considerable a mount of revenue, but we shall have adjusted the burden of taxation much more reasonably and equitably than did their original proposal. Whatever my feelings about the duty- on cotton and linen piece goods may be, I feel bound in honour to follow the Government in supporting the proposal to. have a 10 per cent, duty on the " n.e.i." class. I understood! that in agreeing to the last item without a. division we were carrying out one part of a compact, and I feel it my duty in fairness, to support the other part of it. </para>

                        <para>- It seems somewhat difficult to please the committee. First of all we had the proposal that these goods should be admitted absolutely free. Then our honorable friends on the other side differed as to whether the goods should be admitted free all round, or whether they should pay a duty of 5 per cent, all round, My honorable and learned colleague suggested a means out of the difficulty which I think will be regarded as fair by the majority of the committee. We fell in with the view that it was perhaps a little hard to impose any duty on the poorer classes of goods. But at the same time, I think it is not unreasonable to ask that this particular class of commodities should pay something to the revenue. I am not going to take any notice of the remarks of my honorable friend who twitted me with giving away revenue. It appears to be the practice of some honorable members on that side, whenever I try to meet the difficulties which naturally arise, to crow if they gain a point or two. But so long as we can do what is fair and equitable, they may do all the crowing. From a 10 per cent, duty on this item as it stands we expect to collect £150,000, and the articles can well afford to pay the duty. It is suggested that we should enumerate the articles. But any one who has had experience of the Custom-house, as I have had, .knows that if we enumerate articles that are dutiable they are very soon introduced under different names, and a claim made that they are free of duty. We have tried to put on the exemption list everything that should be exempted. If those who are interested can suggest to us any other articles on which it would be harsh to impose a 10 per cent, duty, we are willing to consider their suggestion, and try to meet their wishes. But we cannot attempt to enumerate the goods which are to be dutiable, because I know what it would lead to from my experience of two or three years of the Custom-house. I have no objection to give the names of some of the articles which this line will cover. Tapestry, cretonnes, chintz, damasks, sateens, linenettes, crepons crimps, prints, piques, vestings quiltings, marcellas, muslins, nets, diapers, and laces are the main articles which will be included. While some of them may be cheap and others more expensive, at the same time we may fairly say that they are all of a class which ought to pay something. The very cheap articles at 6d. or 7d. a yard will not pay very much at 10 per cent., but the expensive articles at 4s. or 5s. a yard will pay in accordance with their value. </para>

                        <para>- Some prints are very valuable. We all know how the fashions change. If some of the better-off people wear goods which are not very much used now, others will follow their example and there will be a good demand for the more expensive descriptions. However, I think the offer we made that the cheaper class of goods which are more extensively used by the poorer people should be placed on the free list, and that the others should pay the lowest revenue impost we are proposing of 10 per cent., is a very fair one. We have spent several hours over these items, and we have a large number of other items in the division to deal with. I am certain that we have all made up our minds, and I hope that we shall now get to a division and that the committee will accept our reasonable proposal. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to vote for the remission of the 10 per cent, duty. I should prefer to have a 5 per cent, duty all round because I believe that to free some articles and place a 10 per cent, duty on the others will lead to a great deal of dishonesty and place the honest trader at a disadvantage. If we removed the duties on cotton stuffs the people would have more money to purchase other articles on which duties are imposed, and in that way we should get more revenue. We ought to consider the persons employed on the wharfs, and in the shipping industry. We have passed a number of items which undoubtedly interfere with the shipping industry in Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and other ports, because every duty of a protective character which prevents importation undoubtedly takes away work from the wharf labourers and others. I do not see why we should not consider that class as well as those Who are employed in other industries. I understand that the honorable member for Moreton seriously suggested that we might make cotton goods in. the Commonwealth, but I do not think that the great majority of the committee believe that for a great many years we can manufacture cotton goods. Therefore, any duty on cotton goods cannot possibly be of a protective character. Taking the articles on which we cannot place a duty of a protective character, the more imports we have the more work will be given to the wharf labourers and others, and they will have money to buy cigars, whisky, and other articles which are liable to very heavy duty. Of course, I would rather see the people spend their money on cotton and woollen stuffs, but at the same time they will buy whisky and cigars, and if the Treasurer is simply considering the revenue, then undoubtedly, if they spend their money on articles on which the duties are heavy, he will get a large return. I should like to see the duties removed from everything if possible. I believe the honorable member for Wentworth was right when he said that this discriminating duty will lead to a tremendous amount of dishonesty. I should prefer the imposition of a 5 per cent, duty all round to the admission of some articles free and the taxing of others at 10 per cent., but as the committee . have decided to free a large portion of them, I shall not hesitate to vote for the freeing of the others. </para>

                    <para>- The Government tried very hard early in the evening to show that extra expenditure would be forced on the Commonwealth in consequence of taking over certain services which are in contemplation. This goes to show that the Treasurer, in raising this revenue of £350,000, is trying to provide for certain expenditure which had not been taken into consideration when he came down with his estimates. When he made his statement early in October he said definitely that there would be a balance of £500,000. When the Prime Minister was before the country, it was distinctly stated that the Tariff would realize about £8,750,000 and all the lines of contemplated expenditure referred to by . the Treasurer were taken into consideration by the Government. Inasmuch as the Government have consented to the remission of duties representing revenue to the extent of £150,000, it is is clear that they feel confident that they will be able to raise the full amount required to carry on the Commonwealth Government and to meet the necessities of the States. Such high duties have been levied upon articles which it is desired to protect, that revenue has been to a very large extent destroyed. The Government have broken their pledge to the country, and now wish to take out of the pockets of the working classes the money necessary to make up for the deficit that will result from the protective incidence of the duties which they have already fixed upon. The articles we are now discussing should be placed on the free list, and the Government, with a balance of £500,000 over and above immediate requirements to meet all possible contingencies, could well afford to make the further concession. The Minister for Trade and Customs has represented that whereas the goods on the 10 per cent, list would be very largely used by the poorer classes, the goods on the 15 per cent, list will be consumed by people who are better able to pay the duty. All classes of the community, however, dress well when they have the means, and goods of the class which it is proposed to tax at 15 per cent, will be found in use among the poorest people. I hope, therefore, that the committee will not consent to exact from the masses of the people duties which they should not be called upon to pay. </para>

                    <para>- I know of no compact in connexion with this item, and I feel under no obligation to support the Government proposal, because of any concessions which may have been made in connexion with' other articles. My first obligation is not to the Government but to the people who sent me here, and I have to consider their wishes. An attempt has been made in connexion 'with these duties to differentiate "between articles that are used by the working classes, and those likely to be used by the more well-to-do classes of the community, but without claiming to be an expert, I have a strong suspicion that many of the articles enumerated as among those used by people who are well able to pay the duty enter extensively into the daily necessities of the working classes. Some of the articles enumerated are dress materials used by the women of the working classes, so that a large proportion of the increased taxation will fall on the toilers, whose burdens I wish to see lightened as much as possible. ' Under Customs taxation it is the great masses who foot the bill, and that has been and always will be the case. The items are defended by supporters of the Government on the plea that this taxation, while undesirable owing to the burdens which it imposes on the masses, is necessary in order to raise revenue. These honorable members with strong protectionist proclivities regret that this need prevents their going to the full extent of putting these articles on the free list. But I do not 'admit that there is this need to compel the committee to impose this taxation on these particular lines. In my place here I have coin batted the Stand taken by the Government that they are Compelled to finance the States as well as the Federation, and I hold that it is quite open to them to allow these articles to appear on the free list, and to adopt the either alternative of which they do not seem to approve. The Tariff has been devised for the two-fold purpose of giving protection to Certain industries, and of raising a very large amount of revenue. But if the Government were prepared to remit a portion of the duties on these items which they have singled out for special treatment, they would get a larger amount of revenue, and place a greater-share of the taxation on the shoulders of those best able to bear it. In that way they could solve the problem, and allow these lines to go on the free list. I shall vote with the honorable member for West Sydney ; and if I cannot get these lines on the free list, I shall endeavour to get them made as nearly free as possible. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, the Treasurer can well afford to make the proposed reductions for the benefit of the masses of the community. Even in Victoria these goods are on the free list, and that is what I should like to see in the Commonwealth Tariff. I know that some honorable members on both sides feel impelled to vote against the proposal to make these goods free, because, in their 'opinion, the necessities of the States demand that we shall raise revenue on cotton goods. If we take the revenue that will be returned to Tasmania, even supposing £1,000,000 of additional taxation is collected from the people through the Customs, we see that it amounts to the small sum of £45,000 or £50,000 ; and before we are called on to submit to such heavy taxation, we should consider whether we are not overloading the people more than was ever . anticipated. The first proposals overloaded the people more than was ever anticipated when the first and second Federal Bills were submitted, . and a great deal more than when the present Government submitted themselves for election. As one who has always been in favour of having customs duties as light as possible, I feel that by placing a heavy duty on cotton goods we. are going much further than ever we anticipated. It is admitted on both sides that there will be some difficulty in determining what goods will come within the item under discussion. I believe prints will be included, and I should like to know why these should not also be on the free list along with other goods of a similar character. The committee, it seems to me, are working in the dark, both in regard to the amount of revenue likely to be received, as a whole, and the amount to be received on this item, and it behoves us to be careful before we place such heavy burdens on the people. I trust that the Government will telegraph to their officers in the various States to supply them with full information as to the amount of revenue which has been derived from every item in the Tariff for the months of October and November. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the proposal of the Government is a fair one, and I shall therefore support it. We have already been successful in obtaining a reduction upon all the cheaper cottons which come into the Commonwealth, and which are in general use among the poorer classes of the community.. In spite of what has been said as to the amount of revenue which this Tariff will yield, I prefer to look a little ahead, and to make provision whereby we shall have something in hand. The Government must have revenue from some source, and I am content to see a 10 per cent, duty imposed upon the better class of cottons in the hope that later on other articles, such as kerosene, will be placed on the free list. </para>

                    <para>- The last few speakers appear to have realized that the stand the Government is taking depends upon their responsibility for the revenue. The , Treasurer told us that he had surrendered £120,000 of revenue on the first section of this item, and he was not prepared to surrender any more. There is no argument against the justice and fairness of the remission of this proposed taxation, but that Ministers cannot afford to surrender any more revenue. I appeal to the Government not to be so easily afraid of the effects upon the revenue because they have postponed items which will bring in £660,000 per annum. The placing of these articles upon the free list would- influence thousands of people in the Commonwealth in voting at the next federal election, and that is a point which the Ministry ought not to disregard. I know that adult suffrage is a part of their programme, and I should not like to see thousands of people, armed with the franchise for the first time, go to the polls with hatred and bitterness in their hearts against the Government, as they will do if this taxation is imposed. </para>

                        <para>- The Ministry fear that they will not get enough revenue, or they are attempting to guide the committee in the wrong direction. If they took the executive responsibility of saying that if this duty is remitted the finances of the Commonwealth will be dislocated, I could understand it. If it is right that the articles in the first section of this item should be on the free list, those in the second section should also be there. I admit that Ministers have made a concession in respect to the other item, and I hope they will now make the full concession, seeing that there is a possibility of making up for any deficiency on items which has yet to be considered. I am sure that the revenue to be derived from the expansion of trade will be sufficient to warrant them in making this concession in the interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>- Personally, I have very little objection to the amount of this duty, though I find that in several of the States the articles under this heading came in free. . Even in the highly-protected State of Victoria these commodities were free, and also in the protected State of South Australia, while in the protected State of Queensland the duty charged upon them is only 5 per cent. The duty proposed here is 10 per cent., and considering the concession made by the Government on the other portion of the item I think the proposition is a fair compromise. I may remind the Treasurer of my modest prediction made last evening - that when we reached the purely revenue producing items we would have the right honorable gentleman getting up and complaining that if we reduced any of the duties the revenue would prove deficient and the solvency of the States would be imperilled. That is exactly what has happened. </para>

                        <para>- I decline to have my conduct measured by the conduct of other honorable members. My freedom is not to be abridged because other people abuse their privileges. I am not in the habit of transgressing the rules, nor am I in the habit of speaking unless I know something of the subject upon which I speak. I have sufficient sense and knowledge of the rules of debate to know what is relevant and what is not. I say that if the Treasurer had not put on these prohibitive duties there would be no occasion now for him to complain of an attempt to reduce purely revenue duties. Surely that is relevant to the subject before the committee ? We cannot separate these items. The items of the Tariff are interdependent. The Treasurer puts on duties which absolutely kill revenue, and he now tells the committee that he cannot permit any reduction in those items, which are relied on to give revenue. It is these prohibitive duties which render it necessary to impose an excessive duty upon such items as this. Unless the Government are prepared to give some guarantee that they will take the duties off kerosene, galvanized iron, and other things used by the settlers and pioneers in the back country, I shall vote for the reduction of this item, although I have admitted that I think the compromise made in this case is a fair one. Unless some such guarantee as I have suggested is given, I shall be forced into the uncompromising position of voting for the reduction of every one of these revenue-producing duties, for the reason that it will compel the Government to reconsider the prohibitive duties they have imposed, and so bring their Tariff down to a purely revenue basis. </para>

                    <para>- We have heard a good deal from the other side about pro- inhibitive duties, but I do not know of one duty yet passed which, can be so described. Every duty passed so far has been considerably less than the duty imposed under the Victorian Tariff, and yet, as has been pointed out before, though out of a total import of £18,000,000 worth of goods, only £6,000,000 were taxable, from that we raised from£2,300,000 to £2,500,000 a year in Victoria. No doubt honorable members accustomed .to free-trade look upon these duties as somewhat high, but we, who have been accustomed to high duties in Victoria, look upon them as moderate, and in no sense as prohibitive. This duty on cottons and linens has a peculiar significance for various reasons. In the first place it is one of the duties from which a large amount of revenue is to be derived, and if the Government are to be deprived of the revenue which they expect to carry on the Commonwealth, the shortage will have to be made up by direct taxation. The acting leader of the Opposition harps continually upon the compact made at the elections, but if there was one general understanding- </para>

                    <para>- I had no opportunity of moving it. I was blocked because the proposal went on the voices. At first it was proposed by the honorable member for West Sydney that the two items should be put on the free list, and I intended, if his amendment were defeated, to move for a 5 per cent, duty all round. Then came the proposal to separate a portion of this item from the rest and to put it on the free list, and to leave the " n,e.i." portion, as it is called, for further consideration. I urged the committee several times to put a duty of 5 per cent, on the items, but my honorable friend had intruded his amendment, and, by the rules we have laid down, unless he had consented to withdraw it, it was impossible for me to move an amendment. Furthermore, I accepted the possibility of the defeat of the proposal to put the first portion on the free list, but there was no division,, and so I' was absolutely blocked in my attempt. I do not object to the honorable member for Tasmania, taking an independent course. I should be very sorry, after fair argument, for any man to vote against his conscientious conviction. I hope that the committee will carry this amendment, which is a reasonable one, to put a 5 per cent, duty on commodities which are used by the great mass of the population, and which it is impossible to manufacture in Australia. </para>

                <para>We see why it was necessary to establish in England a very high protective duty, and also why in the middle of last century it was possible to remove that duty. When duties were first imposed England had what Australia has now - a large number of sheep in the back-blocks, giving a plentiful supply of the raw material. If we establish this industry in Australia, we shall be able to save all the freight and agency expenses which would help us in competing with the English product, and, at the same time, we shall employ our own people. In that way wo shall arrive at the desideratum which free-traders  or revenue tariffists propose to bring about, namely, cheaper production. In England there was a constant increase of the duty until 1850, when the industry had been placed on such satisfactory basis that it was able to dispense with protection. I have no doubt that in time Australia will be able to do the same, if we take the proper steps now. No one can regard this as an exotic industry. </para>

                    <para>As an abstract proposition, it is not, I think, to be denied that there may be industries to which temporary encouragement might profitably be extended. Industries capable in their development of much public benefit have often to struggle under great disadvantages in their beginnings, and their development might sometimes be beneficially hastened by judicious encouragement. And again it is only when imposed upon commodities partly imported and partly produced at. home, or entirely imported, yet capable of being produced at home, that duties can in any way encourage an industry. </para>

The Government reduced the duty by 5 per cent., and then did not arrive at an average ; but this honorable member wants the rate brought back to that which prevails in Victoria, which is taken as the only standard without regard to other States or other conditions. I do not intend at this stage to say what I want to say, because I cannot view with any seriousness the proposal of the honorable member. </para>

                        <para>- I do frequently take a trip, mentally, to New South Wales, and I hope I bear in mind the claims of the senior State. Our friends in New South Wales very often forget, I think, what must have been in their minds before they joined this Federation, namely, that they were joining partners who would require them to give up a great deal of what they had been accustomed to in their methods of taxation. While I have a good deal of sympathy with the people of New South Wales, it is impossible that their claims can be quite met ; and, on the other hand, we cannot expect them to submit to extremes of taxation. I should say, even to those who desire to see the woollen industry progress, that there is no need, in view of the experience of other States, for the large protection which is asked for. The honorable member for Corio has drawn attention to the fact that the - number of people employed in this industry in Tasmania has greatly increased in ten years. That increase has been 120 per cent. The quantity of wool dealt with in the factories of that State has increased 350 per cent, in the same period. If Victoria used wool to the same extent that it is used in the factories of Tasmania the former State would, deal with double the quantity. Under what conditions has the industry in Tasmania been enabled to flourish as it has done ? In Tasmania those engaged in the industry not only supply to a great extent the local market, but are competing, in the better lines of production, in the free market of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt the industry is small - about £30,000 worth in a year ; and I am only pointing out that if the industry in Victoria were on the same scale, it would be of much larger demensions The quantity of wool used in Tasmania is 1 lb. out of every 7 lbs. of its production, whilst in Victoria the consumption represents only 1 lb. out of every 30 lbs. of its production. The industry in the State which I represent has been developed without the aid of any extreme protection. One large mill has doubled its horse-power within the last few years, and two others have introduced new and valuable machinery. The owner of one of these mills declares that any man- who cannot be successful with a protection of 20 per cent, deserves to go to the wall. I suggest that the New South Wales representatives should accept a 20 per cent, duty on the understanding that it should continue for three or four years, in order to give the industry in Victoria a chance to come down from the high level of protection under which it has been carried on, and to return to the other States that amount of' revenue which, I think, they will acquire from this item. I make this suggestion with a view to meeting the extremes on both sides. Victoria cannot expect to have continued to her the present rate, or an increased rate of duty, seeing that relatively a much larger industry has been built up under a smaller protective, duty in what the inhabitants of this State are sometimes prone to term " Sleepy Hollow." </para>

                    <para>The anomaly I would point out is the proposed heavy duty on woollen and worsted goods, on woollen yarns, and on carpets. Of the burden they impose upon the consumers I have nothing to say here, because these burdens are borne by all consumers, and not by wool-growers, shearers, carriers, &amp;c, specially. </para>
                    <para>But the fatal defect of these duties, a defect which does not-7-so far as I am aware - apply to any other proposed duties, either protective or revenue, is that they must materially interfere with the consumption of wool, and thus tend to appreciably lower the price of Australian wool. </para>
                    <para>A remunerative price for our wool is the very life-blood of our prosperity. In spite of the terrible losses in sheep, arising from the drought cycle, which is not yet over, Australia is still the greatest wool producing country in the world, gro wing aim rally about 1 , 250, 000 bales. More than this, among all the varied sources of wealth enjoyed by the Australian Commonwealth, the wool-growing industry gives the largest result. Wheat, butter, gold, silver, and coal, though, products of great importance, all give first place to wool. </para>
                    <para>A rise or fall of only Id. per lb. means roughly a difference of about £2,000,000 to our national income. </para>
                    <para>The general impression seems to be that the consumption in Australia of goods made from wool is so small that it is hardly worth troubling about. This, however, is not the case. True, the population of Australia seems small compared with that of other great countries, but against that the people of Australasia are among the largest consumers of wool per head (in its manufactured form) of any other people in the world. The result is that our importance as . customers of England's woollen manufacture is out of all proportion to our population. </para>
                    <para>The actual values of the exports from the United Kingdom during 1900, of manufactures of wool of all kinds, are thus given in Messrs. Helmuth, Schwartze and Co.'s annual wool report : - </para>

                </para>
                <para>It will be seen that of the net export of £11,119,000, those to Australia amounted in 1900 to 144 per cent. </para>
                <para>The United States, France, &amp;c, have of course large manufactories of their own, which accounts for the comparatively small consumption of British goods, but the above figures show that the consumption of woollen goods, worsteds, and carpets in Australasia must already be an important factor in the demand for. wool throughout the world, and as the population of the Australian Commonwealth 'expands, its demand for wool - if not interfered with by hostile legislation - must become greater. </para>
                <para>Is it wise, therefore, that the Commonwealth Tariff should do anything to restrict that demand? That the proposed duty of 20 per cent, will tend to diminish the consumption of wool goods in Australia and thus restrict that demand is an absolute certainty. The injustice to the whole of those engaged in the wool industry is all the greater, From the fact that it is now quite possible that the materials which compete with wool, and which drag down its price, will be admitted free, I allude to calico, and to various forms of manufactured cotton, and particularly to what is known as "flannelette. </para>

                    <para>Wool is not an article which can be produced cheaply. In Australia, the principal wool-growing country of the world, it is grown and handled almost exclusively by white labour, and at every stage it employs the highest wages. Its merit is not cheapness, but its great suitability for clo'thing, and above all its acknowledged healthiness. " Wool is the best material for all kinds of underclothing," says an eminent authority on hygiene. But its high cost exposes it to the merciless competition of an infinite variety of cotton fabrics. When cotton has been so cheap, and wool so costly, the resources of inventive genius have been well nigh exhausted in the effort to substitute cotton for wool, either by fair means of foul. I use the last word advisedly, because many of the most successful usurpations of wool by cotton, have been made by deluding the consumers into the belief that they were buying wool materials, when they were only getting imitations made chiefly from cotton. Those engaged in the wool industry of Australia do not ask for any special favour from the Commonwealth Tariff. They do not ask that the consumption of cotton shall be repressed in order to encourage the consumption of wool. But what they have a right to expect, and what I doubt not the Federal Legislature will on reconsideration grant them, is that the Federal Tariff shall not discriminate against Australian wool in favour of its great rival, Cotton. Wool is grown in Australia. It is grown by white men. It employs labour at high wages. On the other hand, cotton is not grown in Australia. It is almost exclusively grown by black labour, and probably by the lowest paid labour of any important industry in the whole world. What, therefore, justice demands, and what reason and statesmanship dictate, is that under no circumstances shall any higher duty be imposed upon the manufacturers of wool, than are to be imposed upon the manufacturers of cotton or other competing textiles. The present position is a serious one to the wool industry. </para>
                    <para>The writer concludes by saying - </para>
                    <para>It may not be out of place to refer here to the terribly low price to which Lincoln and coarse crossbred wools have now fallen. These wools, which are mainly grown by small farmers, are now selling at the lowest prices ever recorded, and at those low prices are sometimes almost unsaleable. </para>

The manufacture of such stuff as that has done more to injure the , industry than protective duties will set right for the next 50 years. The honorable member for Southern Melbourne has prompted the honorable member for Corio, and I am pleased that he should have interjected that I was an advocate for the squatter. The growth of wool is the only industry in the district I represent, and the pastoral district of Queensland is as large or larger than New South Wales. I have said that we do not want protection, but .we do want a square deal. I 'have, told honorable members before that the wool industry is the backbone of the Commonwealth, and there is no gainsaying the fact that under this Tariff the squatter is being taxed on everything from narcotics and stimulants to condensed milk. </para>

                    <para>- This is an item which I think should carry more weight with honorable members than probably many items to which we have devoted so much time. The world's consumption of wheat is about 2,500,000,000 bushels, of which we export only 12,000,000 bushels, but Australia is a larger producer of wool than is any of the five continents, and the wool-producer is entitled through his representatives to have his position put fairly and properly before the committee. While I have always said on the hustings that I intended to take no course which would be destructive to the local manufactories, and to maintain as far as possible the rights which the manufacturers had acquired under the State laws, at the same time we must recollect that they have the raw material at their doors. The' wool producer who sends his product to England to be manufactured ' and sent back has to pay in carriage alone l£d. per lb., and the price of wool at the present time at our doors is about 7d. per lb., so. that there is a natural protection of at least 25 per cent. There is a population of 1,100,000 in Victoria, 1,250,000 in New South Wales, 500,000 in Queensland, and a smaller number in the other States. Under the Constitution we have free-trade established between the- States, and thereby the markets for Australian producers have been increased. We, as wool-producers, must look to our own interest. While I shall endeavour in - every way to support the woollen industry, I do not think it is necessary to impose a high protective duty. I believe it will be quite as prosperous under a 15 per cent, duty as under a 25 per cent. duty. The only difficulties which the local manufacturer has to encounter as ' against the Home manufacturer are in regard to machinery and wages. It is quite likely, as time rolls by, that the great manufacturers in other parts of the world will send out their machinery and establish very large woollen factories under a moderate duty, seeing that they will have the raw material at their very doors. I suppose that the manufacturers in this State are like the manufacturers elsewhere, and that as soon as the Tariff is passed they will begin to fix the price of their products as high as ever it will allow. We have to consider the different phases through 'which the wool has "to go after it is removed from the sheep's back. We have decided practically to admit free cotton goods, which are coming greatly into competition with the wool-producer. The wool which we shall manufacture here for years to come will represent only a small proportion of our clip. We shall always be very large exporters of wool to other parts of the world, and therefore we are interested in seeing that the wool-grower gets fair access to the markets of the world. We must be careful not to adopt a duty which will prohibit the importation of our surplus wool in the shape of woollen goods, but to have a duty sufficiently high to give our wool manufacturers the command of the local markets. We do not wish, however, to have a duty which may enable them to create a monopoly, and prevent our wool exporters from sharing in the markets of the world. 'As producers -and consumers of wool, we have to enter into competition with the producers of linens and calicoes. We wish to be put on a fair footing in that competition, and 15 per cent., I think, is a fair duty to impose. I believe the woollen mills in Tasmania were built up under a 10 per cent. duty. When I was in Queensland some time ago, the duty was 15 per cent. In New South Wales, woollen mills were established without the aid of a duty, though I think they are now asking for some consideration. The -woollen factories have not to get their raw material from other countries where cheap labour is employed. Fortunately, in New South Wales -we have coal, and I believe that in the valley of the Hunter, and probably round Newcastle, woollen factories will be established within a few years. I also believe that the woollen factories in Victoria will become more prosperous under Inter-State free-trade. Now that federation has given confidence to all trades and businesses, I expect that fresh capital will be brought into Australia by large business firms abroad, but I do not consider that a high duty is required to start woollen manufactories in Australia. </para>

Not only so, but the interests of the manufacturers, the pastoralists, and the consumers have been advocated. The honorable member for Corio represents an electorate in which the woollen industry is a very important one, and he was performing his manifest duty in seeking to influence the committee in favour of the imposition of a high duty. On the other hand, we find the honorable member for Gwydir, as a leading pastoralist, distinctly opposed to the duty, whilst the honorable member for Maranoa has spoken most forcibly from the point of view of both the consumer and the pastoralist. The honorable member for Tasmania has expressed himself as being content to have the duty continued for another four or five years at the rate of 20 per cent. But, if we grant assistance for that period, we shall have the greatest difficulty in discontinuing it. </para>

                        <para>- It will be difficult to induce the committee to do that. The honorable member for Corio would not be content to have the duty limited to any particular period, and members of the- Ministry, who apparently regard this as a revenue duty, would be similarly disinclined to fix any specific term beyond which the duty should cease to operate. This cannot be looked upon by the Government as a protective duty in the sense of its operating to the exclusion of imports, because the Government expect to receive from it revenue to the extent of £100,000 per annum in Victoria, and £115,000 in New South Wales, whilst the total to be derived from the whole of the Commonwealth is £335,000. We have some very successful woollen- mills in operation in New South Wales, and the prosperity of the industry is there indicated by the recent extension of the Marrickville mills in the electorate of the honorable member for Lang. Large buildings have recently been erected there, and the extension of operations thus provided for was decided upon long before any information could be obtained as to the fiscal policy that would be adopted by the Commonwealth. The success of our woollen mills depends very largely upon the introduction of the latest and most approved machinery, and upon enlisting the most expert assistance from the old world. If we are to compete successfully with the woollen manufacturers of Great Britain and elsewhere, we shall have to follow their practice of renewing the mill machinery every five years, and incorporating the very latest improvements. This will involve the employment of large capital and "the most efficient managers. It has been stated that one reason why Australian woollens have not met with general acceptance in the local markets is that they lack variety of pattern. The material is good and thoroughly serviceable, but it does not attract the public taste, and this is a matter that will require to be remedied if success is to be assured. In New South Wales, under freetrade, the woollen industry has been built up on a thoroughly sound foundation, and, after the experience gained in that State, we free-traders cannot be expected to consent to an increase of the duty as desired by the Victorian manufacturers. If the natural protection afforded by freight and other charges to which the imported article is subject is added to the 20 per cent, duty proposed by the Government, the protection given to the local manufacturers will amount to 30 per cent., and that should be more than ample to meet all the necessities of the case, even from the point of view of the local manufacture. As far as I am personally concerned, I think the interests of the consumers are most entitled to consideration, and I shall therefore vote to place these goods on the free list, or at any rate to reduce the duty to the lowest possible figure. </para>

                    <para>- If the honorable member is asking us to give protection to men who manage their business in such a foolish manner as that, we should refuse to do so. If a squatter can get a certain price by sending his wool to London, he will readily accept that price, less transit expenses, if offered on the spot, without having to wait until, the London returns come back. If we give consideration to manufacturers we must see that we do not enable them to raise the price of their products unduly, so as to force consumption on to other goods, and consequently reduce the consumption of Australian wool. If any industry should prosper it ought to be the woollen industry of Australia under the new conditions of federation. I do not say that the industry had the same opportunities under the old conditions, because the difficulty of providing diversity of pattern, make, and weight for the small population of one State must have met manufacturers frequently. There was a considerable disadvantage in the smallness of the market, in competing with the manufacturers of other countries ; but now there is a large and increasing market of nearly 4,000,000 of people, and a much smaller duty ought to be sufficient. One "Victorian manufacturer, as we know, wrote to the newspapers saying that he did not require the duty ; and no manufacturer would do that if it were not a fact. He admitted that for some time he had not been prosperous, but he showed that that was through following wrong methods, and that, now he had obtained proper machinery and system, he did not require any duty. There is a natural protection of at least 25 per cent, or 30 per cent, in sending the wool to England to be manufactured and returning the cloth j and, under, these conditions, the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth is sufficient. There are in-, eluded in this woollen duty a large number of items which were free in the Victorian Tariff, and there will consequently be a considerable accession of revenue. The value of the importations into Victoria of such item?, principally dress goods part wool, was £300,517, and a duty on that amount: at 20 per cent, would realize £66,000. while a duty of 10 per cent, would, of course, produce exactly one-half. The importations into the other States of these materials represented a much larger revenue, and, with these other goods included, I do not know how the Minister comes to anticipate from a20 per cent, duty on all woollens, only some £300,000 odd. If we take the same rate of imports as we find in Victoria, these extra goods ought to yield about £198,000 at 20 per cent. </para>

A fair compromise has been offered by the Government, and most honorable members, when addressing their constituents, said that the Tariff would have to be a compromise between the two contending parties - the free-traders and protectionists. We all felt that there could not possibly be anything approaching prohibition, any more than there could be anything like free-trade. I believe that the Government have struck a fair average in suggesting that the duty should be 20 per cent., and I therefore urge upon the honorable and learned member to withdraw his amendment. </para>

In 1898 the number of adult males employed in the industry was 166, whereas two years later they had decreased to 161. The adult female operatives numbered 69 in 1898, and only 58 in 1900. Moreover, the horse-power in use declined from 185 in 1898 to 165 in 1900. The industry in </para>

                        <para>- For that reason I have only included adult males and females. I would further point out that in Victoria in 189S the horse-power employed was 770. In 1899 it was 1150, which represented an increase of 50 per cent., and in 1900 it was 1305, an increase of nearly 100 per cent. That is the best answer that can be possibly given to some of the statements which have been made by various honorable members. The result of the operation of a 15 per cent, duty in the other States is only too. apparent. Under the Government compromise it may be possible for the industry to struggle on, but it will certainly never prosper and expand. I therefore ask the committee to vote for 25 per cent, as the minimum amount of encouragement which the industry is entitled to claim. </para>

I am not throwing out any charges, and I. hope I shall- say nothing which is in any sense irritating, but we have not done much in the shape of business to-night, though we have done a good deal in the shape of debate.

We have been told that these duties are going to do a. great deal, but we have no right to tax the consumer to the extent here proposed, until we have some authoritative statement as to the effects of the operation of the Tariff within the last seven or eight weeks. I have tried to ascertain the exact financial aspect of the Government proposals., and I make no secret of my intention, unless we get this information, to move the adjournment of the debate. I do not desire to do that, but we have asked several times for information bearing upon the revenue received under the Tariff during October and November. The information could be obtained by telegraph in 24 hours, and we ought to have it. </para>

                    <para>- I think the honorable member for Macquarie has very nearly concluded his speech. The honorable member for Grampians wishes to speak, and perhaps another honorable member, and I should like to discuss this very important item at an hour when there is a reasonable hope of being reported in the press. I do not wish to dictate to the Government, but I urge that it would facilitate the progress of business if they would agree to an adjournment. I shall do all I can within the first hour or two to-morrow to get a vote taken on this item.. I had no opportunity until half-past twelve o'clock to speak. But it is not fair to me, as representing the Opposition and the free-trade party of Australia, to be expected to speak at this hour. Compared with this portion, all the rest of the Tariff is practically a matter of form. It involves the question of the protection to be given to the manufacturers. When this item is dealt with, the way will be cleared considerably for the consideration of other items, because it is the basis of the system we are -building up under this division. It is no pleasure to me to see time wasted or extreme measures taken. </para>

                        <para>- That does not affect this item. The debate we have had so far has been chiefly on purely revenue items, in which the question of free-trade or protection was not introduced. We have now reached the first item in this division in which that question is involved. I am not very sanguine of winning, but the very fact that I am weak in numbers ought to induce Ministers as a matter of honour and chivalry to give me a reasonable opportunity to declare the position of this party. I have never sought to take the business of the House out of the hands of. Ministers, but have always tried to help them to make progress, .and when my own followers have been in the wrong once or twice, I have been one of the first to intervene, as I did this afternoon when an effort was made not to give fair latitude to the Treasurer. I would remind the Minister for Trade and Customs, who seems disinclined to yield, that the Tariff is the property of the committee, and if it thinks that a reasonable amount of business has been done, Ministers ought not to say - "We demand that you sholl go on with this most important item, and we shall keep you here until it is decided, whether there is a reasonable attendance or not." In this matter a little wise concession will do no harm. Any honorable member who knows my responsibilities and my work will realize that I am as anxious for the session to close as any man can be. Not being very strong physically it is no pleasure to me to be sitting here at this hour, and, therefore, I ask for an adjournment. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt we should not have got any more work done. I realize that whether we adjourn at 10.30 or 1.30, or whether we sit through the night, we are not going to get any more work done. All yesterday we discussed two items. The acting leader of the Opposition then desired to make a general statement. I knew that it would take up an hour or two of our time which might be otherwise spent, but so that he should have no cause of complaint I willingly acceded to his desire. He spoke for close upon an hour, and his statement, with a few other speeches, brought us up to the hour of adjournment. At this sitting we have been discussing one item. The proposed duty upon woollen piece goods has been discussed generally. An honorable member moved an amendment to increase the duty, but the general discussion was continued, and if my honorable friend had so desired there was nothing to prevent him from speaking on the general question. If we make up our minds to do work instead of spending an immense amount of time in discussion, we should dispose of the items far more quickly. We on this side would be only too glad to get away. </para>

                        <para>- It is no doubt an important item, but I see no difficulty in coming to a decision. It is plainly required of us by those who sent us here that we should dispose of this Tariff as soon as we possibly can. It is necessary that we should settle something so that the commercial community may know what to do, and much as I would like to oblige my honorable friend, I cannot see my way to accede to his suggestion. The Prime Minister has made a most reasonable request, and I trust that we shall come to a vote on the question now before us, and also deal with the other duties relating to piece goods within a reasonable time. </para>

Most of us have been compelled to sit here until it is too late to reach our homes, and we should now go on until the completion of the business in hand. I find that during the present sitting there have been 48 speeches delivered by members on the opposite side of the Chamber, whilst, including the utterances of the Ministers, there have been only 28 speeches delivered from this side of the Chamber. Members of the Opposition have occupied no less than 6 hours 47 minutes of the time at our disposal, whilst members on the Government side, including Ministers, have only spent 2 hours 42 minutes in addressing the committee. </para>

From the attitude of the other side it is clear that they intended us to say what we like to empty benches ; that they were determined to force this division through ; that this is no longer a deliberative assembly, representing public opinion. If that is their idea of their duty they hold a very different view from that which I entertain. If I belonged to an overwhelming majority, and we thought it right to continue a sitting while the other side gave expression to their opinions I, think, as a matter of courtesy, I should remain in my place. If any blame is attachable to any one, it falls upon those who have forced us into the position of having to protect our constitutional rights. This country does not expect its deliberative assembly to sit all hours of the day and night. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable gentleman think that it would be better to withdraw, and that his word should not be taken as his bond ? I have all through my life regarded, and I still regard the honorable gentleman as an honorable man. But when the honorable gentleman makes a promise of this kind and moves such a motion only the next night, and repeats the same tactics now, am I forced to say that I still believe his word to be his bond ? I leave it to the honorable gentleman's conscience to answer. Time after time the Government adjourned the House at reasonable hours on the application of members of the Opposition. They have repeatedly allowed members on that side to continue their speeches on the following day, as if they had not said enough already, and the leave has been repeatedly abused. Either the consent of the honorable gentleman has been obtained for these tactics, or he is utterly unable to- control' his followers. I see that" honorable members opposite have a muster now. They .have four members present. But they know that if a division occurs their chances are hopeless. They have, regulated the position on their side, or else they are not a party. If they have regulated it, let them explain the meaning of the word "obstruction." If they have not regulated it, then I ask them by what right they seek to prevent the progress of business by making a show of this kind.?' This is about the hollowest exhibition ever made before a deliberative assembly. We: thought that we should come into a higher arena in the Federal Parliament; We. have endeavoured to carry out our duty to- the country, but at every stage we find our endeavours to keep faith with the country persistently blocked. There are those who are constantly talking about public opinion, but public opinion has spoken, and we are endeavouring to carry it out. The public will speak, too, about this conduct of the Opposition, and will not be limited to the forms of Parliament, but will express itself in plain honest English concerning those who pursue these tactics. </para>

                        <para>- It is an absolute fact, and it has been proved by the action of the Government. I allowed the work to go on until twelve o'clock this morning, and we are told that we obstruct when we refuse to carry on business at that hour. The fact is, sir, that we have one or two honorable gentlemen who think they can ride roughshod over everybody. But let me tell them that although they rode roughshod over everybody in the Little Pedlington from which they came, they will not ride roughshod over the Opposition in the Federal Parliament. Providence has been kind to us. Under our rules we cannot be forced into the position which the Government desire us to take up, and if they say to us - "We defy you," we can hurl back the defiance, and say to them - "We defy you." Is it to be a matter of physical endurance ? At the battle of Waterloo, a gentleman said something to the Duke of Wellington, who replied - " It is a matter of hard pounding, and we shall "see who will pound the hardest." The Government are trying to do some hard pounding. It is not a very nice exhibition for a strong party, which has at its back a majority of members who are nearly all located in this city, and can appear in their seats continuously, because they are not called away to other States. It is not a very nice kind of struggle. It does not reflect any credit on the party. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that what I said bears that interpretation. My object is to protest, and to say that I intend to go on protesting that we have no right to proceed at this hour of the morning. Look at the appearance of the Minister for Trade and Customs. He is absolutely worn out. He has a look of absolute apathy in which there is not a gleam of that intelligence which usually distinguishes him. There is no bobbing up and down as is usual with him in the early part of the evening. There is no twitching of the face; no movement of the hands such as we usually see. He has absolutely collapsed. I have a very kindly regard for the constitution of the Treasurer, and I am sorry that he is kept here. I would suggest that the Minister for Defence and the Minister without a portfolio might be allowed to take charge of the Tariff for a while. I am very sorry that there is not sufficient chivalry on the other side to extend one word of sympathy to us. Honorable members there are incapable of understanding the situation.' It shows the inherent evils of party government. We have a number of honorable members who, if they went outside and said what they believed, would say that the Opposition is an injured minority, and that they are ashamed of what the ' Government are doing, but the moment they come under the political influence of the Chamber they 23 r feel that they have to give themselves over, body and soul, to the command of their superiors. I hope that some of them will assist me to sustain my position, by telling me privately that they very much sympathize with us, because of the very unreasonable position taken up by the Ministry. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Wentworth in his second speech has made against the Government a deliberate charge of conspiracy at the very time when they were asking the House to grant an extra sitting day. I challenge my honorable friend to bring forward one tittle of evidence in support of his statement. I deny that there was ever any thought of a' conspiracy. If any Government were to do such a thing as he has deliberately alleged, it would not be worthy to remain on these benches a minute longer, and its members would not be worthy to remain in the House. The statement of my honorable friend has no foundation, and he cannot bring forward any evidence in support of it. </para>

                        <para>- We can only judge the Government by their actions. The first four or five months of this session were occupied with a number of machinery Bills, and a majority of the members of the Opposition sat calmly in their places whilst one after another of the Government supporters discussed the whole of the details of those measures. The time thus spent would have been far better employed over the Tariff, and the Government must be held entirely to blame for having brought about the present situation. The experience we have had of these long sittings is not a favorable one, for no progress has been made, and nearly the whole time has been wasted over recriminations. The Opposition are doing their plain duty to the country in seeing that the public business is transacted while honorable members are capable of giving due attention to the matters brought before them. The condition to which we are now reduced is not quite so had as that which has prevailed in some of the State Parliaments, and I should be very sorry to see this Parliament degenerate until it reached a similar pass. </para>

                        <para>- The public expect that important matters such as are dealt with in this Tariff will be fully and carefully considered, and not discussed in a thin House at an early hour in the morning. We have affirmed the principle of an eight hours' day, and the people of the Commonwealth do not desire that honorable members should not only sit for an unreasonable length of time, but overwork all the officers of the House. If the Government were so anxious to get through with the business, why did they not arrange to sit in the mornings ? </para>

                        <para>- It will be very absurd if the House is kept sitting day and night, because no satisfactory work can be done under such circumstances. There is a lot more work to be done this session, and late sittings will retard rather than facilitate business. No one is more interested than myself in getting an adjournment for a month or six weeks, in order to attend to my private affairs in Western Australia, but I am here to do the work of the country as satisfactorily as possible. The Government put us in an unfair position by attempting to rush items through, when honorable members are really tired out, and I must protest against this mode of conducting the business of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I shall endeavour to con- fine my remarks to the subject of the motion. This Tariff should have been brought forward much earlier in the session - by at least the first week of J July. If we had been- discussing it ever since then, they might fairly urge that the items had been fully discussed from every point of view ; but we have now had it before us barely four weeks, and in that time have passed items producing a very large amount of revenue. In my opinion the Ministry should allow the postponement of such large revenue duties as we were discussing before the motion to report progress was made. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member were opposed to the Government, could we be held responsible for anything he might say 1 From the Opposition side 2S speeches were delivered by 17 speakers, occupying 3 hours and 18 minutes. What becomes of the statement of the honorable member for laanecoorie that the Opposition have been obstructing the business of the committee? At 1.26 a.m. the honorable member for Wentworth, speaking a second time, strongly urged the Prime Minister to adjourn, and it was not until 1.55 a.m. that he moved the Chairman out of the chair. If there has been anything unfair in the debate, certainly a charge of obstruction cannot be levelled against the Opposition, when we had delivered only 28 speeches, as against 49 from labour members and Government supporters, when only 18 members on this side have spoken as against 30 members representing the labour party and the Government side, and when we have occupied only 3 hours 18 minute* as against 4 hours 36 minutes occupied by those opposite. I am surprised at the Prime Minister repeating in pretty much the same language a speech he delivered the other day, when he rushed into the chamber and charged the Opposition with obstruction, when, as a matter of fact, they had not taken up as much time as has been taken up to-night. He made charges of a most gross nature against the Opposition, although he had not been present. He had to depend on a garbled, statement. </para>

                        <para>- A certain charge of wasting time has been levelled against members of the Opposition, and I am giving this information to the committee in order to refute the charge. On our side those who took part were the honorable members for Wentworth, South Australia - Messrs. Glynn, V. L. Solomon, Poynton - North Sydney, Parramatta, Werriwa, Robertson, Macquarie, and Dalley. The figures I have given are sufficient to show how unfair is the charge made by the honorable member for Laanecoorie against the Opposition, who are endeavouring to prevent the levying of taxation to the amount of £1,000,000, when hardly a quarter of the members are present and the press are not fully represented. We are perfectly prepared to let the people judge between us, and. to say whether we are not justified in preventing the imposition of -taxation, when no opportunity is given for fair debate. The measures dealing with a white Australia were measures which required full discussion, and upon which the proceedings of Parliament should have been fully reported in the press, and honorable members will remember that those measures were not discussed later than about 11 o'clock at night, and there was no attempt to rush them through without consideration. No action has been more justified by subsequent events' than the action taken by the Opposition in connexion with the motion of censure. That is proved by the alterations which have been made in the Tariff, and which will yet be made in it. The Prime Minister told the people on one occasion that a revenue of not more than £4,000,000 would be required, and it is the more necessary that we should do our duty in the consideration of this measure in view of the fact that the people have been misled and deceived by the right honorable gentleman. </para>

                        <para>- I was replying to an interjection. AVe are told that the desire of the Government is to get this Tariff through before Christmas, because the business people are at a loss what to do until it is passed. It must be remembered, however, that when the Tariff leaves this chamber the perplexity will be rather increased, seeing that the measure goes to another Chamber which has powers of suggestion which amount to powers of amendment. I should be delighted to get the Tariff through before Christmas, but I shall not allow any question of adjournment to interfere with free discussion. Our object to-night is to prevent the Government dragging this Tariff through in unreasonable hours. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister must allow us to interpret for ourselves the rules of conduct, and what are the functions of an Opposition. We ought to exercise the most searching criticism in regard to a Tariff which has so much to do with the lives of the people of the Commonwealth. The Tariff was brought up too late this session, but something may be gained if the measure is not rushed through before the Christmas adjournment. If this House could have disposed of the Tariff by that time I should have been prepared to sit night and day to see the business put through ; but since nothing can be gained by doing that, why should we sink pur legitimate functions of criticism? I hope that the reasons I have given will weigh with the committee, and that the motion will be ultimately carried. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well for Ministers to say that they have charge of the business of the country. They certainly have ; but the Opposition have also a duty to perform in connexion with the proceedings of Parliament, and they are entitled to speak on behalf of a large majority of the people of one or two of the States. We have heard something about the rising of public feeling in favour of the actions of the Government, but really the rising of public feeling has been in the opposite direction, and if Ministers appeared before the outraged people of New South Wales they would find that that is the case. It has been claimed in connexion with the item under discussion that it is in consequence of the system of ' protection that large woollen mills have been established in Victoria, but if, after having had the advantage of protection for from 25 to 30 years, those engaged in the industry are not able to get along by themselves, it proves that their industry is an exotic, and the sooner it is got rid of the better. I do not, however, admit that the wool-manufacturing industry is an exotic industry in Australia. We know what was said on the subject by the honorable member for Maranoa. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to transgress the rules of debate, and I appreciate the latitude extended to me. Although the Tariff is the most important business we shall have to discuss in the House this session, the Government postponed its introduction until within a short time of Christmas, and night after night we have found them ready, on suggestions being made to back down on item after item. If they had had the interests of the Commonwealth properly at heart, and had recognised the difficulties in framing a Tariff to meet the wants of the people, then, instead of delaying its introduction until nearly Christmas, when honorable members are naturally very anxious to return to their homes, they would have submitted it in the early months of the session. The Ministry, with a majority at their back, are trying to play the old game, which has been a disgrace to every State Parliament, and which I, as a young Australian, fondly hoped would never take place in the Commonwealth Parliament. I never thought that I should see enacted here by a Government with a brutal majority the same old scenes that I have witnessed in Syd nev. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the term, which, as you are aware, sir, I was drawn into using because it was in common use in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. Even in the Victorian Parliament this practice used to be indulged in. We had a scene enacted here last week, and another is being enacted this week. If the supporters-of ' the Government were sitting on this side of the House, and saw their leader treated as ours has been treated to-night, I undertake to say that they would be found standing most firmly by him, and resenting the tyranny of the Government. I hope that we shall not have such scenes enacted here. I trust that the proceedings of the House will be carried on in that higher atmosphere about which we have heard so much, and with that dignity and decorum which the people expect to reign amongst their representatives. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion for the Chairman to leave the chair. We strongly object to the way in which the Government tried to force the duty on woollen piece goods down our throats. Not many years ago the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, the Attorney-General, and other staunch supporters of this Government helped to constitute an anti-sw,eating league, and held a series of meetings and examinations in this city, and did their best to relieve the sufferings of the working classes. The records of history show that, so far as the conditions of the labouring classes and the distribution of wealth are concerned, free-trade England stands immensely superior amongst the nations of the world, as free-trade New South Wales does amongst the united Australian States. Yet, at the very beginning of the national history of Australia, these gentlemen who said in years gone by that they would not place the shackles of protection round her shapely limbs, are trying now to do so, and to make a few manufacturers and monopolists rich at the expense of the great masses of the community. I believe it will be a very bad day for Australia and its people if we establish a system of protection such as was attempted to be forced through the committee by the Government when this motion was moved by my honorable friend. Although it is said that protection would be a good thing for the Commonwealth, yet New South Wales stands far and away ahead of the States in which that policy has been tried. We are perfectly content with our position. I noticed in the Sydney press the other day that the Commonwealth revenue is coming in by leaps and bounds. We were told that it was coming in in a fashion which cannot be explained. Remembering that the Government relied on the figures for 1899, I did not feel at all surprised that there has been a very large increase on their estimate. If the revenue is increasing' by leaps and bounds every honorable member should try to keep the taxation of the people down as much as possible. When the Constitution Bill was submitted to the States, it was declared that the Commonwealth would require a revenue not higher than £9,000,000, but now we learn that the return will reach £12,000,000. If that is so, surely it is a reason and a justification for the Opposition fighting the Tariff in a legitimate way. I feel sure that no fair man can accuse the Opposition of unduly occupying the time of the committee. The records which have been quoted by the honorable member for Macquarie fully bear out that view. It has been clearly proved that the honorable member for Laanecoorie was mistaken in his estimate of the time taken up by the honorable members on the Government and Opposition sides. Up to the time when he received his figures from the Chairman, 28 speeches had been delivered from the Opposition side by 18 speakers, occupying three hours eighteen minutes, while from the Government side and the labour corner 49 speeches were delivered by 30 members, occupying three hours thirty-one minutes. </para>

                <para>Mr.FULLER. - I put down to the blame of the Opposition only speeches which were delivered by its members. Are we to be held responsible for speeches delivered by honorable members sitting on the cross benches on this side? Or is the Prime Minister to be held responsible for anything which may be done by the labour party sitting on the cross benches on the other side ? If the Government attempt to force business through in this sort of way in the future, I shall be one to. sit behind the leader of the Opposition to do what is best in the interests of all Australia. </para>

No honorable member has received more consideration from his fellow members than has the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, and if I find him wanting in that good feeling which he should display towards others, I shall take an opportunity of making him aware of the frequent breaches of the rules which he himself commits. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that proceedings such as these must have a serious effect upon honorable members, and it is regrettable that members of the Opposition should feel called upon to adopt their present tactics as a protest against the action of the Government. I am anxious to see the Tariff passed, but it is necessary that the Senate should fully understand that the Tariff when it -goes forward to them will represent the deliberate opinions of this House. By hurrying through the Tariff without proper discussion the Government will excite not only the resentment of the public, but also, possibly, a great deal of opposition in the other Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I did not grasp that, at any rate. Had I done so I should have remonstrated with the Minister, or have interpreted his remarks as a rather cumbersome joke. Up till half-past twelve a.m. there was no obstruction to the progress of business. The debate upon the proposal of the honorable and learned member for Corio had occupied two hours. At half-past twelve a.m. the honorable and learned member saw that the prospect of carrying his amendment was so hopeless that he withdrew it without endeavouring to take a vote upon it, and without obtaining a single supporter. At that hour I think it was a fair thing to ask for an adjournment, especially in view of the fact that certain honorable members had left the House in the belief that business would not be proceeded with after midnight. Up till twelve o'clock, two hours and thirty eight minutes had been occupied by Government supporters, and one hour and fifty eight minutes by members of the labour party, or a total of four hours thirty-six minutes, as against three hours and eighteen minutes absorbed by members of the Opposition, despite the fact that it is only reasonable to expect that the Opposition, who have to fight this Tariff tooth and nail, will occupy a longer period in discussing it than will those 'members who are perfectly satisfied with it. Between half-past twelve a.m. and half-past one a.m. I repeatedly, but vainly, urged the Government to adjourn ; and, finally, I was compelled to move that the Chairman do leave the chair. That is the history of the whole matter, and I leave it to this Chamber, and the country, to decide upon which side lies the right or the wrong. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest that the Government and the Opposition should arrange a compromise. This House ought to be governed by reason, and honorable members ought not to do anything which they cannot defend in the high forum of the human conscience. Therefore, with all due humility, I suggest that the Government, the Opposition, and the labour party should confer together with a view of expediting the transaction of public business. The Britisher will not stand bullying of any kind. He is a most extraordinary animal, and will fight to the last ditch. That is the position of the Opposition, and it is also the position of the Government. I therefore repeat that the wisest course to adopt is to arrange a compromise by which business will be facilitated and all sources of friction removed. </para>

I have in my mind two or three honorable members who come to the table and there lose their individuality. Do they go there with the idea of having their photographs taken by some gentleman in the gallery? Every honorable member, excepting. Ministers, to whom the use of the table is a great convenience, should speak from his place in the House. I say that in all the Australian States, a quarter of a century ago, parliamentary warfare was conducted much better than it is in this House at the present time. I am ashamed of the conduct of some honorable members. When I came down here, after making a big fight in the ultra-democratic region in Australia, I thought I was going to learn something. I am humiliated and abased at what has been going on. Perhaps both sides are to blame, but certainly we cannot continue to conduct our business in the way we have been doing. We are making ourselves the jest of the Southern. Hemisphere. We talk about, the great nation which Australia is to be in the future, of her sea-girt shore, and of one people with one destiny </para>

                    <para>- PATERSON. - There are many reasons why the Chairman should not leave the chair. The principal one is that he should not leave it at the instance of the New South Wales party. New South- Wales claims to be the mother State, but her representatives have given evidence of the fact that if she is the oldest, she is also the- most foolish. The New South Wales party in this House seem to think-that they represent not only Australia, but the Southern Hemisphere. Why do they not recognise that the whole question is one of compromise ?

                        <para>- The acting leader of the- Opposition is doing his best, consistently with- the discharge of his duty to the public, to secure that end. I do not think that his request was an unreasonable one, because the Tariff is the most important work of the session, and, in view of all precedents, we are not taking an undue time in the discussion of it. If the Government desire to pass the Tariff quickly, they must exercise due patience and consideration, and- not attempt to force honorable members to sit here until all hours in the morning. </para>

                        <para>- I should have done so, as I will show. I have listened to-day- to two Government supporters, whose speeches have had no bearing whatever on the question before us, and who have been simply wasting time. The honorable member for Laanecoorie occupied ten or fifteen minutes in exposing his utter ignorance of the condition of parties in this House, and the honorable and learned member for Brisbane- occupied a similar time in delivering the most extraordinary lecture as to the character and attitude of this Parliament that it has ever been my fate to listen to. There is abundance of evidence that the members of- the Opposition- are not responsible for doing anything more than their duty, namely to secure the fullest discussion upon every item in this Tariff. And the acting leader of the Opposition was perfectly right in insisting that the business should be discussed by honorable members when they were in the full possession of- their faculties, and within- reasonable hours. If the  Government had been properly apprised of the proper position of- affairs, they would gladly have availed- themselves of the offer of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>- The Government have gained nothing by the course they have adopted, and I would ask whether it is not possible for us to arrive at some understanding so that public business may be expedited. The whole difficulty may be overcome by the exercise of a little common sense. We did a good day's work yesterday, and I do not think any exception could be taken to the way in which the discussion proceeded upon the items which engaged our attention up to midnight. No attempt was made to block legitimate business, the whole discussion was fair and reasonable, and the Government were not justified in making an attempt to force the committee to give their consideration to further items beyond the ordinary sitting hours. After midnight we were asked by the Government to take up the consideration of an item which was quite as important as that over which we had spent some eight or nine hours just before; and if we had acceded to their request we should have renounced any claim we might have to be a deliberative assembly, prepared to discuss honestly and fairly all the matters brought before us. The conditions under which the Government desired us to continue the debate were utterly inimical to good work ; and I now ask whether in the interests of the community generally some arrangement cannot be arrived at by which the business of the country may be carried on in a reasonable way. Instead of keeping us here all night the Government should arrange for morning sittings. I shall be prepared to sit here from nine or ten o'clock in the morning until midnight, but I will not sacrifice my health by remaining here all night. I hope that the acting leader of the Opposition will now withdraw his motion so that we may be able to get to work. </para>

                        <para>- The members on the Government side of the House on this item occupied two hours, and the labour party 84 minutes. 'On the second division the honorable member for West Sydney occupied only one minute, while two members of the direct Opposition spoke for ten minutes. On the third division the labour party occupied 33 minutes, while the Government supporters took up 43 minutes, and the Opposition about 66 minutes. The totals are the best test, and we find that on the Government side there were 29 speeches delivered by eighteen members, who occupied two hours 38 minutes. . Twelve members of the labour party made twenty speeches, and occupied one hour and 58 minutes, while seventeen members of the Opposition made 28 speeches, and occupied three hours eighteen minutes. The Government supporters and the labour party between them made 49 speeches, 30 members occupying four hours 36 minutes, while the Opposition made. 29 speeches, seventeen members occupying three hours eighteen minutes. These figures show a difference against the Government of 21 speeches, thirteen members, and one hour thirteen minutes. The item then under discussion involved taxation to the amount of £338,000, and the first proposal was to pass taxation amounting to £1,500,000 at one sitting. But the Opposition took a stand against such an iniquitous proposal, and asserted their right of free, honest discussion. In the House of Commons no new business is allowed after twelve o'clock, and the same principle underlies our Standing Order 70, which provides that no opposed business shall be taken after eleven o'clock at night,unlesstheHouseotherwiseorders. That standing order shows an intention that we shall not be , called upon to rush through important items at unreasonable hours, because to all intents and purposes an item which involves taxation to the amount of £338,000, may be considered new business. The Opposition have succeeded in their task of preventing discussion on important questions at a time when honorable, members were not in a fit condition to transact business. </para>

                    <para>- I recognise the wish of the acting leader of the Opposition that the debate should now close, the object having been accomplished of preventing important business in the earl)' hours of the morning, when honorable members were mentally incapable of transacting it. I desire to say one or two words in support of the point submitted by the honorable member for Macquarie, as to the meaning and intention of Standing Order 70. Whether that standing order is technically applicable to proceedings in committee, it at any rate indicates the sense of the House as to the inexpediency of considering matters of acute contention when honorable members' bodies are weary and their minds are relaxed. I should like to know whether "business," within the meaning of the standing order, includes items in Committee of Ways and Means. In the House of Commons no opposed business is taken after half-past twelve o'clock on most days, or after half-past five on one day. The moment half-past twelve is reached, the Speaker, or the Chairman, as the case may be, declines to go any further with opposed business, and in the case of the former progress is reported. The point is whether in Committee of Ways and Means each particular item of a proposed resolution is " business " within the meaning of the standing order. Having regard to the rule in the House of Commons, it would seem that the Opposition were morally right in applying the sense, if not the letter, of Standing Order 70. In the House of Commons the Chairman does not wait for a motion, but anticipates the desire of the House as expressed by the standing order ; and what the leader of the Opposition has done is really to ask the committee to enforce the standing orders which- prescribe the conduct of business. As to proceedings in Ways and Means, it has been decided in the House of Commons that items of a Bill are opposed business, and that " opposed business " means that upon which divisions may take place. If business unopposed is taken after half-past twelve o'clock in the House of Commons, the the moment a division is asked for the </para>

I know of one particular case in which a firm admitted that they could carry on their business successfully with the aid of a smaller duty, but when they were questioned as to the duty for which they intended to ask, they replied - " We are going to get the highest duty that we can." What will be the effect of the proposed duty in a country like Australia, a large area of which possesses a tropical and sub-tropical climate? Honorable members will not deny that if we impose a 20 per cent, duty upon woollens, we shall make them practically 30 per cent, dearer than the imported article. The result will be that the working man will be driven to wear cotton goods, and do we not know that the individual who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow should for the sake of his health use woollen goods? Some honorable members favour this duty, and profess to be democrats, but that is the most unutterable hypocrisy ever known in the political life of this country. I am perfectly satisfied that the worst thing that can happen to the manufacturers- in Victoria is a continuance of- the operation of these high duties. There will be such a reaction in Australia, that probably the whole of these duties will be swept away. In the interests of the workers of Australia and as a compromise, I beg to move - </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be far better if we credited each other with honest intentions. I fail to see why charges of hypocrisy should be levelled against this side, or that the desire to do what is best for the working man rests entirely with the other side. I do not believe that there is hypocrisy upon either the Government or the Opposition side of the House. I am glad that the acting leader of the Opposition proposes to give these articles some measure of protection. He has now admitted that many industries are entitled to reasonable protection against what he described the other night as the " sweepings," which are landed here from foreign markets. </para>

                        <para>- Will my honorable friend allow me to make a personal explanation? I was twitted the other night with being interested as an importer, and I said that as far as those interests were concerned, a reasonable duty would benefit me far better than a free port, because Sydney received the " sweepings " of the world. When I saw the sense in which the word "sweepings" was interpreted, I substituted the words, " surplus products of the world." These, I said,, came into the port of Sydney, and were inimical to my business. But I never in any sense gave up my free'trade principles. I was content to accept the Prime Minister's own words that we could not have extreme free-trade any more than we could have extreme protection. Therefore, in almost every case I have moved for the imposition of a moderate duty. I have no present desire to do away with that moderate protection to which we are practically pledged, but at the same time I hope to see it ultimately removed. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend must not forget that I was in the Customs-house for two or three years, and, that I learnt a good deal there with regard to these importations. I know from what I saw in the invoices that, without doubt, many of these goods were slaughtered. That means that, not only do they come into competition with our manufactures at a half or two-thirds of their true value ; but that the duty instead of being paid on the true value, is paid only on the half or two-thirds valuation. By this means the benefit of the protective duty is reduced. I do not think that my honorable friend can contend that the proposed duty is a prohibitive one, because we expect to receive from it £336,000. I look upon it from two points of view. This duty will afford a considerable amount of protection to our local manufacturers, but it certainly will not give them the command of the market. If, however, the proposal of the acting leader of the Opposition is carried out, and the duty is reduced to 10 per cent., one of two things clearly must happen. If we import only the same quantity of woollen materials that we do now, it necessarily follows that we shall receive as. revenue only one half of the amount we expect to collect. Now, that is a serious loss. On the other hand, if we are to collect the same amount that we expect, we must import double the material we now import. If that happens, we shall receive only the same amount of revenue that we now expect, but we shall take away from the local manufacturer a large proportion of his present trade. </para>

                        <para>-Then we shall have to import them, but just to the. extent to which we increase our importations we must take away trade from our home manufacturers. The fact of our giving our manufacturers less work to do will have this serious effect. Honorable members know that the larger the output in any particular business the smaller is the cost of the article produced, and that is one of the reasons why large' manufacturers in America and elsewhere can send goods into our markets and sell them at a profit in spite of the duty we impose. We have a smaller number of people to manufacture for, and although that will be to some extent remedied by Inter-State free-trade, we need not infer that there is going to be any increase in the prices, because we know full well there will be competition between Sydney and Melbourne, if there is no competition between the manufacturers in those two cities and those in other parts of the Commonwealth. That necessarily means that the goods will be sold at such prices as will give a fair margin of profit to the "manufacturer, and no more. We were told by the honorable member for Maranoa that by putting on this duty we were going to penalize the wool-grower. I felt some difficulty in following what the honorable member meant bv that, because I take it for granted that we shall have to buy for our own requirements, and, in doing so, shall have to compete with those who purchase for Great Britain, Germany, France, and other places to which our wool' is exported. </para>

If they can show that we are arriving at a wrong decision, I shall be only too glad to hark back and do what is fair. "Whilst I admit that we should consider the wool-grower, we should study our wool manufacturers also. Surely they are entitled to be considered to as great an extent as the wool-growers, if not to an even greater extent. " The fact that the wool-growers are not being penalized is shown when I state that we expect to import woollen goods to the extent of £1,680,000 in value. That shows that a large importation will undoubtedly take place. With regard, to the amount of protection that is necessary, I think it has been pretty clearly demonstrated that the rates of wages paid here are just double those paid in Great Britain. I cannot guarantee the figures given in the circular which has been distributed to honorable members, but I believe them to be correct. With reference to tweeds, the wages vary from 4¼d. to 9¼d. per string at Huddersfield, against lOd. to 1s. 8d. at Ballarat. Then with regard to worsteds, it is stated that - </para>

                    <para>It is, however, when we c6me to compare the fast loom price in Ballarat with the fast loom price here that the greatest difference is shown. The price at the Antipodes is only reduced 2d. per stg. for the fast loom, whilst here it is reduced one-third. Let us see how this works out on the four classes of goods which we have quoted - 30 picks here would be 8s. 6d., there it would be 10s. (id : 40 picks here would be lis., there 21s. 9d. ; 50 picks at home would be 13s. lid., abroad it would be 26s. 3d : whilst at 60 picks our price is 16s., and theirs 31s. 6d, or nearly double what is paid here. In the case of women, too, the difference is again brought into account, and ths difference is greater still. In worsted goods the difference is not quite so wide, because it seems that they pay less for worsted warps by 2d. per stg., or 3s. per cut, whilst here there is only 5 per cent, difference in some cases. As a matter of fact they are paying considerably more money on the fast looms in Ballarat than is paid here for both fast and slow looms. </para>

                        <para>- As far as I know, the Victorian woollen mills give employment to a large number of people, and do not pay more than a fair return on a trading investment. It was stated last night that one Sydney firm had paid a dividend of 6 per cent., but I do not think that is a return such as we should expect from any manufacturing concern. I fail to see why we should be forced to send raw material from Australia to be made up in Great Britain or some other country, and then re-import that material to enable us to make up the clothes that we have to wear. The woollen industry is one to which we should give a fair amount of protection, so that we may be able to make up our raw material here. </para>

                        <para>- I have already stated my reasons. It was stated by the honorable member for Macquarie that some woollen articles were dearer in Victoria than in New South Wales, and when inquiry was made it was found that these were Jaeger's goods. Of course those are not made here, and the imposts upon such articles are revenue duties. We know that where there is no competition within the Commonwealth, a revenue duty undoubtedly adds to the price which the consumer has to pay ; but where there is competition here, we certainly do not have to pay the whole, if we have to pay any, of the duty that has been imposed. I would °ask the honorable member for Macquarie to mention some .goods which are imported, and which are .also manufactured here, so that we may compare Sydney and Melbourne prices. </para>

                        <para>- We have heard a great deal about -the natural .protection which is afforded by the freight and other charges upon imported goods. We have been told that the natural protection added to the .10 per cent, duty which the acting leader of the -Opposition proposes, will give the local manufacturer an advantage of 30 per cent. I presume 'that the -freight and charges include the cost of carrying ' the raw material to the 'factory in England, and bringing it out here in a manufactured form. We know, with regard to the question of freight, that concessions are made when goods are sent out to Australia, and that every effort is being made by building large ships, and in other ways to cheapen freights. Then again, as a set off against this natural protection, we must not forget that the cost of freight 'from woollen mills at such places as Castlemaine and Ballarat to Melbourne must be very considerable, and that it probably bears a fair proportion to the freights which are paid on goods imported. t </para>

                    <para>- I desire to reply to some of the statements of the Treasurer. He has 'told us that this is by no means a prohibitive duty, because he expects to receive from it revenue to the extent of £336,000. The right honorable gentleman, however, omitted to inform the committee that the £336,000 must very largely be made up of duties on goods which are not manufactured in the Australian woollen mills. I have figures here to show that woollen dress goods, which were not subject to duty in Victoria, and which were not manufactured by the local woollen mills, were imported into Victoria to the amount of £300,517. A 20 per cent, duty upon that amount would realize £6 6, 000, . and assuming that a similar proportion of these goods were imported into the other States, the total amount of revenue received from a duty of 20 per cent, on woollen dress pieces would be £198,000. There are also other articles which are not manufactured here, and upon which the amount of duty paid must be large, and these figures tend to show that if the Treasurer's estimate is correct, as to which I have previously explained my doubts, practically the whole of the estimated revenue is derived from articles such as are not manufactured by local mills; consequently the Tariff must be practically prohibitive in its incidence as to the articles which local mills do manufacture. This is an indication. that the Treasurer, or whoever compiled the figures, thought that as- regards the articles that are made here the duty would .be practically prohibitive. I was astonished to hear the Treasurer state that surplus goods from foreign parts were sent here at half or two-thirds their value, and that they were charged duty only upon the reduced amount. If so, that would imply a very extraordinary administration of the Customs department. </para>

                        <para>- If the administration of 'the Customs department is so lax as to admit of the importation of goods on the payment of- duty upon less than their real value, I do not think that the committee should-give power to the Government to tax goods by percentage on their value. The Treasurer practically states that it is impossible to check values, and that the Customs must accept the invoices as their guide, but in the case of articles such as woollens there should be no difficulty in arriving at the true values. The difference in wages paid here as compared with those earned by operatives in Great Britain has been referred to. At the very lowest estimate the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth to impose a duty of 10 per cent, will afford the local manufacturer a protection of 33J per cent., because he will have the benefit of all the natural protection that is afforded by ' the charges for freight, insurance, buying and -selling commissions, wharfage, and the carriage of wool from London to the mills, and then the cost of sending the goods out here. This would be the protection on ordinary average wools. If 'the higher wages paid here are to be regarded as an' adequate set off to this natural protection with 10 per cent, duty, it will be necessary to show that at least one-fourth of the output of local manufacturers is represented by wages. We .know very well what are the total wages paid in Victoria, and if they represent one-fourth of the output, the output must be very small indeed. That being1 so, the whole of the wages and more are accounted for by the natural advantages and the duty of 10 per cent. I am inclined to think with the Treasurer that New South Wales possesses superior advantages for manufacture; but if, with these advantages, that State can produce at a cheaper rate than Victoria, the latter cannot get the benefit of any protection, even if 50 per cent, be granted. Victoria can only be protected to the extent of the rates that will pay the New South Wales mills, which are said to have superior advantages. The output of the New South Wales factories has been limited by two causes. One cause is that all markets have been shut against them by excluding Tariffs ; and the second is that, whilst they have their own market, there is less wool used in that State than in the southern State. But even so, the New South Wales mills, while not paying handsomely, give a return to the proprietors ; and if we take 6 per cent, as the dividend of one of the best known mills, and we pass a duty of 10 per cent., the proprietors will be enabled to increase their prices and earnings to that extent. </para>

                        <para>- I say it would mean more, but 16 per cent, would enable the New South Wales mills to compete with the trade throughout the Commonwealth. I agree, however, that the 10 per cent, would probably nob be taken, because competition would naturally induce a lower price, and if not taken, that is the best evidence that 10 per cent, is ample from the honorable member's protectionist standpoint. </para>

                        <para>- The result of the com- ' petition was that both locally-manufactured and imported goods were cheaper than if the latter had been allowed to come in over sea at a duty of 10 per cent. It is a reasonable hypothesis that this competition must throw the duty back on the foreign manufacturers, who otherwise would not be able to get into the market. In the later stages internal competition keeps the price below what imported goods would be even if admitted free. </para>

                        <para>- The use of a duty is to give the local manufacturer something to compete for, because otherwise he could not get the market or keep it, owing to the cutting of prices, which is an every-day market operation, and against which the greatest force is that of the State. In 1900 the imports into New South Wales of all kinds of woollens came to £769,748, while in Victoria, including £300,000 worth of dress pieces, they totalled £700,000. The reason for this equality in piece goods was that New South Wales imported manufactured apparel much more largely than Victoria. This manufactured, apparel, valued at 1,250,000, came from all sorts of places, where wages and the conditions of production are such as would not be submitted to in Australia, even if the alternative were the closing of all our factories. The re-exports from New South Wales last year of woollen goods amounted to £78,563, whereas those of Victoria were valued at only £45,038. At first sight it might appear that New South Wales was establishing a foreign trade by means of her unprotected factories, which Victoria could not do under protection. But out of the £78,563 worth of reexports only £110 worth represented Australian made goods, the rest being of foreign production ; whereas the £45,000 worth of goods re-exported by Victoria had, with the exception of £2,000, been made in that State. I have always been what I call a moderate protectionist ; that is, I believe that the barrier which we put up to protect our internal trade should be high enough to secure the chance to the local manufacturer of a footing in the local market after paying proper wages, and to enable him to get a sufficiently large market for an output great enough to make it possible to provide a reasonable article at a proper price. Above such a limit there is the danger, which always exists, whether in a free-trade or a protectionist country, of combinations to take undue advantage of conditions. So long, however, as the barrier is not too high the danger is minimized, because the moment prices are unduly raised, imports from abroad, at prices reduced so as to secure the market, destroy combinations and maintain things at a proper level. In Victoria ' the duties have been reduced from 45 per cent, to 25 per cent., .which rate has prevailed from 1895 ; and the proposed reduction of 5 per cent, is a serious matter for the mills. 23 t </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking relatively, but of absolute products. There is no reason why this industry should remain purely Victorian, now that the border barriers have been removed, and there is one fiscal wall against the outside world. Woollen mills inside must now take their chances one with the other, and in an Australian industry of this character the fact that New South Wales, with all her advantages, has . only four mills, is sufficient proof that reasonable protection is necessary. To offer the woollen industry of Australia a duty of 10 per cent, is offering a stone where bread is wanted. Personally, I think a duty of 25 per cent, is not unreasonable, but, in a spirit of compromise, I am  ready to accept 20 per cent., in the hope that the larger markets now available will make up the difference. </para>

                    <para>- The acting leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer have both dwelt on the question of natural protection, but there is one aspect on which they have not* touched. The fall in the price of wool in the last few years seems to me to have very much increased the natural protection of the industry. Wool which was sold a few years ago at ls. is now not worth more than' 8d., representing a fall in value of something like 33 per cent. When we come to the lower-priced wool, we find a greater relative fall in value. Wool which a few years ago brought 9d. now brings only 6d., and in the coarser crossbreds there has been a fall of something like 50 per cent. I think I am well within the estimate when I say that the cost of taking the raw material, say to Bradford, and bringing back the manufactured article is not less than 2d. per lb ; indeed, I am informed by an expert in the trade that the cost is a good deal more. But' if we take the cost at 2d. per lb., and apply it to wool selling at ls. per lb., that means a natural protection of 10§ per cent., but on the same wool selling at 8d., the natural protection is 25 per cent. Taking the wool which sells at 9d., the cost means a protection of 22 2-9ths. per cent.,' and on the same wool- at 6d. it means 33½ per cent. The medium and lower classes of wools- are those which are most used in the factories, and if we apply the same test to wool sold 'at 4d. per lb. we find that the natural protection is 50 per cent. I do not advocate a duty so low as that proposed by the acting leader of the Opposition. The Treasurer has on occasions endeavoured to strike an average as amongst the various States, and if, taking into consideration that New South Wales- is free, he does so in this case, he will find that the average duty is something like 14-½ per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That may be a strong argument, but I wish to act with what are called moderate men on the other side, and to support a duty which I think we shall be able to get. If we add a duty of 15 per cent, to the highest class of wool sold at 8d. per lb; we find that the protection amounts to 40 per cent, or 8s. in the £1 ; on the wool at 6d. it means a protection of 48J per cent., or almost 10s. in the £1. </para>

The price of wool is about 33 per cent, lower than it was five or six years ago, and I see no likelihood of a change. My own cross-bred wool in London has not been sold yet, because the price of that class of wool is so low that I hope it may improve; </para>

                    <para>- To ray mind the acting leader of the Opposition has offered a very fair compromise to the Government. According to the experience of the honorable member for the Gwydir,. the cost of manufacture in England is 15 per cent, as against 25 per cent, in Australia, or a difference of 10 per cent., which is the amount of duty proposed by the honorable member for Wentworth. But the local manufacturer enjoys a natural protection because of the freight between here and the mother country, which upon the statement of the honorable member for the Grampians represents about 33 per. cent. That is quite as much protection as&gt; any Australian manufacturer can expect, seeing that in New South Wales the industry has had no protection whatever. In most of the States 1 know from experience that the superior class of textiles are not manufactured. According to the testimony of experts the best tweeds worn in Australia are imported. The honorable and learned member for Corinella I  said that the imports into New, South Wales and Victoria were very similar in value; In this connexion I wish to mention, that in 1900, New South Wales imported £682,759 worth of superior tweeds, whilst Victoria imported £668,419 worth. These goods were imported into Victoria because they cannot be manufactured here. They are manufactured in England and Scotland, and the duty which it is proposed to impose upon these materials would constitute, a direct tax upon the consumer. It represents upon every suit of clothes made of that material an extra cost of 15s. I would further point out that the honorable member for North Sydney has definitely stated that woollen dress material cannot be made in Australia. The standard width is 44 inches, and it is used by women only, because the width is not suitable for the manufacture of men's clothing. The honorable member's argument was to my mind most convincing. Upon this particular line of goods, which cannot be manufactured in Australia, I find that the Treasurer estimates he will derive a. revenue of £198,000. I might also mention another, line of goods which is not made in Australia, and which has hitherto been admitted free of duty. I refer to dress melton cloth. To impose a duty upon that will be of no benefit to the manufacturer. He may be able to charge an extra price upon the duty which is paid, but he cannot produce the class of article which is used in the manufacture of caps. In connexion with saddlery and horse collars, we know that the cloth and serge used constitutes the raw material for the manufacturer. Yet the Government propose to levy a 20 per cent, duty upon the importations of this material. </para>

                    <para>- The question for us to consider, is whether if we reduce this duty we shall do any serious and. permanent injury to the woollen manufacturers within the Commonwealth. It has been urged by the Treasurer that we shall not only lose revenue by reducing this duty, but that we shall cripple the local manufacturer of woollen goods. It seemed to me, however, that the honorable member for North Sydney utterly demolished the right honorable gentleman's arguments. I admit that protection has done something towards establishing the Victorian woollen industry, but it has been done at a tremendous cost to the whole community. - 1 do not see any force in the argument of the Minister for Trade and Customs that if we import more of these woollen goods we shall incur a national loss. If the men now employed in the woollen industry can no longer find employment at that avocation, they will have to obtain other work, and it does not follow that their labour will be entirely lost to the community. I contend that it is natural for us to carry on the manufacture of woollen goods, and that we ought to be able to do this without the assistance of a protective duty. It has been stated that certain natural advantages, which are enjoyed in New South Wales, enabled the manufacturers there to succeed without the assistance of any protective duty, whereas the Victorian manufacturers - without these natural advantages - have needed the assistance of a protective duty of 25 per cent. If this is a correct statement of the position, and certain natural advantages have enabled New South. Wales woollen factories to succeed without the aid of protection, the effect of imposing a duty of 20 per cent, upon woollen goods will be not to protect the Victorian manufacturer, but to hand the amount of the -duty over to the manufacturers who will start operations in New South Wales, and eventually be able to wipe the Victorian manufacturer out of existence. There are other places in Australasia in which the manufacture of woollens has been carried on with great success, and without any such natural advantages as it is claimed are possessed by New South Wales. Take the case of New Zealand. Her woollen manufactures, in the shape of rugs, tweeds, and blankets, have been exported to New South Wales for many years past, and have been able to compete successfully, and in the open market, with the rest of the world. The New Zealand goods are selected as the very best obtainable, and the fact that they have been able to compete successfully with foreign manufactures affords a very strong argument against any excessive protection. It may be stated that New Zealand exports her surplus manufactures to New South Wales, and that she is able to dispose of them at a cheaper rate to outside customers than to consumers in New Zealand itself ; but as against that, I can quote the case of Aitken's woollen factory at Hobart, the products of which command a ready sale in Sydney. Messrs. Aitken Brothers do not send their surplus products to the Australian market, because their woollen goods in the form of dress materials, blankets, and flannels, are so eagerly sought for that they have no surplus at all ; the orders they receive are very much in advance of what they can produce. Immediately the ports of Australia are thrown open to these woollen goods, more capital will be embarked in the Tasmanian industry, and Messrs. Aitken Bros, will be prepared without any duty to carry on a successful business for the benefit of the whole of the Commonwealth. I agree that we should raise revenue without destroying industries, and I am prepared to give some protection to industries now established. At the same time, I shall be no party to imposing a duty such as is now proposed by the Government, and I shall, therefore, support the amendment of the honorable member for Wentworth. . </para>

                    <para>- I desire to point out in reference to the New Zealand woollen industry that the manufacturers there are protected by a duty of 20 per cent., and that in spite of this the imports of: woollen piece goods into New Zealand increased from £170,000 worth in 1894 to- £297,000 worth in 1899. Therefore, the woollen industry of New Zealand cannot be making any great headway, and it is useless to point to that colony as affording an example for our guidance. It might be assumed that woollen goods were displaced to a very great extent by the importation of apparel- and slops, but the statistics show that the imports of apparel and slops increased in value from £300,000 worth in 1894 to £395,000 worth in 1S99- This increase in apparel and slops has taken place in the face of a protective duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot agree with the proposal of the Government, nor with the amendment proposed by the acting leader of the Opposition, as I think that a 15 per cent, duty would be sufficiently high for the purposes of revenue, and in order to afford some degree of protection to local manufacturers.. I do not think the duty is imposed so much for revenue purposes as for the protection, of the woollen manufacturers of Victoria. This industry has been heavily protected for many years, and by this time it should! be in a position to compete with the outside world, with a far lower rate of duty than that proposed by the Ministry. Considering the duties which have hitherto been levied upon woollen goods throughout the States, I think 15 per cent, would represent a fair compromise, and that by adopting: that rate we should be showing plenty of. consideration for the Victorian woollen industry. </para>

                    <para>- It has been claimed by -some honorable members that protection reduces prices, but judging from the experience of two ladies from Western Australia, whom I met soon after my arrival here, woollen goods - blankets, ,at any rate - are dearer in Melbourne than in Western Australia. A 20 per cent, duty is altogether too high, as,- with the natural protection, it would amount to fully 50 per cent. It would be a dangerous thing for us to give any manufacturing industry such heavy protection. I do not anticipate any danger from importers' rings in connexion with the woollen industry, if we fix the duty at a moderate rate; but there will be some danger not only of importers', but also of manufacturers' rings, if we impose a high duty. Although I believe that the woollen industry should not require any assistance except the -natural protection which has been so frequently referred to, I am prepared, in view of the position of Victoria, to compromise matters by agreeing to a duty of 15 per cent. </para>

                    <para>- We have been told that there is considerable natural protection in this industry, and that in every State except Western Australia, mills are progressing, In one case it is said that dividends of 6 per cent.- have been paid, which, with a duty of 10 per cent., means profits of 16 per cent. These industries have been flourishing for a considerable time, and it has been found necessary, more particularly in Victoria, to reduce the duties. In Western Australia there is a 10 per cent, duty, and our imports, considering the population, are large. During 1900 the* total imports represented £214,164: of cotton and woollen goods, and the duty which was paid at 10 per cent, amounted to £21,000 odd. In a place with a small population like Western Australia, it would penalize the people to double the duty, and some consideration should be shown to the consumers there. In consideration of the revenue required, I am prepared to support a duty of 10 per cent. Possibly in time to come there may be a woollen industry in Western Australia; but if the article manufactured in the Eastern States is of good quality, the State which I represent would sooner encourage Australian manufactures than imports from outside the Commonwealth. After what has been said in regard to various protective duties, the Government ought to realize that it is a great mistake to pile heavy duties on articles used to such a large extent as woollen goods. </para>

I am strongly of opinion that this is one of the industries which should receive such assistance as, keeping the revenue in mind, may be given to it, and I shall be glad to support a duty- of 1 5 per cent. In considering this question we must have regard to the duty on the manufactured article which we shall subsequently have to consider. While theoretically in favour of the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth, I cannot see my way to vote for it in view of the existing industries. </para>

                    <para>- I do not want" the House to be -under any misapprehension as to how my vote will go, and I at once say that. I cannot support the proposal of 20 per cent. It may seem strange that, entering the House as a pronounced protectionist, I am not able to see eye to eye with my friends of Victoria. This is not a matter of revenue so much as a matter of protection, and the Ministry would no doubt be quite satisfied, so far as revenue is concerned, with a 15 per cent, duty. I might almost say that I am more in sympathy with the views expressed by the acting leader of the Opposition than with those of the Government upon this question. It may be correct that 10 per cent, added to the natural advantages would be sufficient to ensure the development of this great industry in the' Commonwealth, but I am anxious to make sure that there shall be no doubt of the establishment of the industry. I am, therefore, prepared to compromise, and vote for 15 per cent., feeling quite sure that with the natural advantages added the protection will- come to over 30 per cent., as shown by the honorable member for North Sydney and the honorable member for Gwydir. I am sorry to differ from the Government, but I must follow the dictates of my own conscience, and remember the pledges I gave to my constituents, as a moderate protectionist. </para>

                    <para>- In the absence of any proposal for- a lower duty, I shall support a reduction to 10 per cent. This is an industry which ought to be carried on without any protection. I know there is a difference between the rate of wages here and that in England, but in the woollen manufactures wages are unfortunately a very small item. The- raw material is produced here and has to be sent home for manufacture, and, from that circumstance, the natural protection more than counterbalances any difference of wages. The fact is the manufacturers here are competing against the high class machinery of the old country. fourteen or fifteen years ago the Bradford firm, of which Isaac Holden was the head, laid in machinery which cost £1,000,000 ; and against such a state of things it is impossible for the small factories here to compete. As to the competition of the local article with the imported article reducing prices, that might be the result if we had three or four competing companies here, but witli a Tariff such as the Government proposes, which would prevent importation, it would not be very long before the four or five manufacturers amalgamated and had the community at their mercy. If a duty of 25 per cent, gave the whole market, it would not be long before some home firm to whom a million of money would be nothing, would come out and crush the local manufacturers. If the duties were all removed and woollen articles were admitted free, I should be prepared to subsidize local manufacture to the full amount of the labour they employ. </para>

In 1878 when the duty was 10 per cent., the people employed in the industry in Victoria was 736, whereas in 1895 when the iniquitous duty of 40 per cent, was imposed, the number decreased to 710. The total number of hands employed in the woollen mills throughout the Commonwealth is not more than 1,500. </para>

                    <para>- If the' remarks of the last speaker go to prove anything, it is that 20 per cent, is a proper duty to impose. We all know that natural conditions constitute an important factor in the success of any industry, and in this connexion the kink, of mind of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is most extraordinary. He goes so far as to compare the conditions of to-day with those which existed 37 years ago. When the honorable member talks of the success of the factory in Geelong 37 years ago without the aid of protection, and says it should be a success today without any such aid, he leaves out of consideration most material factors. Thirty-seven years ago the freight rates alone constituted a splendid protection to the Victorian manufacturer, provided he had the necessary machinery to begin operations. But times have changed since then. The honorable member has attempted to compare things which are utterly unlike. Surely' he will admit that Kalgoorlie could not be developed if the same conditions prevailed there to-day as obtained 10 years ago. I cannot support the proposal to reduce the duty upon this article to 10 per cent., although it has been stated that I have committed myself in writing to a maximum of 15 per cent. I hope that whenever that statement is repeated in this Chamber, those making it will produce some evidence in support of it. The view which I take of the situation in connexion with this particular industry is that the wider market which has resulted from the adoption of Inter-State free-trade, will enable the industry to succeed in Victoria with a lower rate of duty than that which has hitherto prevailed. It is not the manufacturer, however, who has derived the benefit of the duty which formerly operated. As a matter of fact, I am credibly informed that the best class of woollen cloth is obtainable here at a. rate which approximates very closely to that ruling in Yorkshire. But from some peculiar set of circumstances, the manufacturers of woollen cloth have not been able to get their goods direct on to the market, and the warehousemen of the city have been distributing those goods and obtaining the spoil. But with the wider field for operations which is now available, it is certain that such conditions will not be allowed to continue. In conclusion, I might point out that there are some, classes of woollen piece goods which we do not manufacture within the Commonwealth, such as dress piece goods, and woollen material ; also serge, which is used in connexion with saddlery. . At a later stage, I shall move that these articles be placed upon the free list. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest that some distinction might be made between ordinary tweeds, and women's dress goods. This class of goods is not manufactured within the Commonwealth, and has hitherto been free of duty in Victoria. I understand that there is not a sufficient demand for any one particular line of goods to justify our mill-owners in putting up the machinery necessary to manufacture women's dress pieces ; and I would suggest that we might consider the duty on this particular line from a revenue rather than a protectionist stand-point, and fix it at a lower rate. </para>

                        <para>- I am absolutely against exemptions of cloth which can be used for different purposes, because that always leads to fraud.. As to flannelettes, I am aware that at the beginning of the Tariff it is said that all imitations are to be dutiable at the rate 'which is placed on the goods they imitate. I am prepared to admit that if people like to say an article is what it is not they ought to pay . the higher duty ; but I am told that flannelette, which everybody knows to be cotton, is to be tortured into an imitation of flannel and to pay the highest duty. Flannelette has come into great use amongst the larger portion of the population, and I believe that its popularity has been brought about by the high duties placed on woollens. I should like to be informed why flannelette is placed on the higher rate. </para>

                    <para>- The reason is that flannelette is a fraud. It is an imitation of wool, and is disposed of under circumstances in which many people mistake it for the more valuable article, with results altogether to be deplored. The Government sympathize with all the observations which fell from the honorable member for the Grampians . Flannelette is highly dangerous, and half the deaths from burnings are occasioned through wearing this material. So far from possessing the quality of flannel in regard to warmth and comfort, 'flannelette after being washed gives no warmth, but exposes the  wearer to danger and disease due to changes of temperature. </para>

                        <para>- There is a great deal to be said in favour of keeping it out, and one step in that direction is to subject it to a higher duty. The Comptroller-General speaks warmly in support of the duty, pointing out that flannelette largely competes with our staple production here, is sold to people who believe it to be wool, and is so dangerous that over and over again coroners have emphasized the risk of wearing it, especially to young children and infants. Anybody taking a portion of flannelette and setting a light to it will be astonished at the rapidity with which it blazes, and the difficulty of extinguishing the flames before the article is absolutely consumed. Under the circumstances the Government are justified in going to the length they propose, if not in adopting more stringent measures. </para>

                        <para>- I merely wish to point out in connexion with this particular item that in three of the States it has been customary to allow a margin of 10 per cent, between the duty upon the raw material and the finished article. That is the reason why we fixed the duty upon silks at 15 per cent., instead of at 20 per cent. We wanted to allow of that margin between the duty upon the raw material and that upon the finished article, but found that we could not accomplish our purpose without asking for too large a duty upon the manufactured article. In connexion with woollens, we were forced to leave a difference of only 5 per cent., or else to ask for a duty of 35 per cent, upon the made up article. We therefore elected to leave a margin of 5 per cent., although I think that it should be at least 10 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that New South Wales in the future will make almost all the apparel and attire which her inhabitants need. ' As I understand the matter, New South Wales imports a large quantity of apparel and attire which ought to be manufactured in our own States. Surely it is not unreasonable to say that in this industry, which employs a very large number of people, who would find it difficult to secure other employment, there shall be a margin of 10 per cent, between the duty upon the raw material, most of which has to be imported, and that on the made up article. Under the circumstances, I hope the committee will not reduce the impost. </para>

Moreover, the honorable member must know that voluntary agreements are seldom worth the paper upon which they are written.. They must be followed by legislative enactment. I appeal especially to the labour representatives in the interests of the workers not to reduce the duty upon this item. According to my latest advices, there are 20,000 tailoresses in the east end of London who are receiving less than 8s. per week, whilst we are paying 21s. per week. Natural, protection is of no use to such an industry, when we come to compare the difference in the conditions which obtain in the two countries. </para>

                    <para>- In South Australia and Victoria wages boards have been appointed to regulate the clothing trade, and we are hopeful that in New South Wales the State legislation on industrial questions will soon place the workers there in a better position than they now occupy. In New South Wales the imports of wearing apparel in 1899 were valued at £994,791, whereas the Victorian imports were. valued at only £186,000. This shows that the clothing required by the people of Victoria is very largely manufactured within the State, and- 1 hope that the 10 per cent, margin proposed by the Government will be agreed to by the committee, so that the present satisfactory condition of things may not be unduly disturbed. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest, that hosiery might be placed under a separate heading. I am told that a good deal of hosiery used by the working classes contains but a very small proportion of wool, and that it should not be subject to the high rate of duty under which it will fall, unless some special provision is made regarding it. I understand "that, notwithstanding the high protective duty on apparel and slops,- and the comparative freedom from duty of the raw material, the greater number of- the articles of apparel used in South Australia are not manufactured there, and are not likely to be. Hosiery is an article that ought to be specially, considered because, however- small the proportion of wool it may cod tain, it will, according to the Government proposals, be subject to a duty of 25 per cent. It has been assumed that all the raw materials used in the "manufacture of wearing apparel will be charged 15 per cent, duty ; whereas a large proportion of the raw material used in making, up these goods is admitted free of duty. I would point out, however, that there is a duty of- 15 per cent, upon woollen piece goods, and upon flannel and flannelettes, and- that woollen piece goods are manufactured' articles. Then again, other materials are subject to a duty of - only 10 per cent., and still others are, as I stated before, admitted free of duty; and it is upon all these materials when they are manufactured into wearing  apparel that 25 per cent, duty is charged. There is another ' suggestion I should like to make to the Treasurer as coming from the Adelaide Warehousemens' Association. </para>

It is the poor workers who require the most protection, but I am not sure whether 25 per cent, on the one hand and 10 per cent, on the other is quite fair. These workers are all over the continent, and I shall give them the benefit of the doubt in this particular instance. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members seem to forget that they form p'art and parcel of the Commonwealth for which we are now legislating. If there was a 30 per cent, duty in Victoria before, it only means that there was 20 per cent, too much. If we reduce the duty on the raw material, what will be the position with respect to the 25 per cent, duty ? </para>

                        <para>- With a duty of 25 per cent, on the made-up article, and 15 per cent, duty on the raw material, there is a margin of 10 per cent. It will probably be desired to give a greater measure of protection to the hosiery manufacturers than 10 per cent., and it will be competent to reduce the duty of 15 per cent, on yarn to- 10 per cent. On the other hand, it is said that this particular yarn is manufactured to some extent in Ballarat, but we can deal with that when we reach the item. . </para>

                    <para>- I must protest against the duty which is proposed on these articles by the Government as detrimental to the best interests of the people of the Commonwealth. If this system of protection is forced on us we. ought to insist that articles which purport to be woollen are made of wool. I hold in my hand a return showing to what extent alleged woollen goods and blankets are adulterated with cotton. This return is from one of the most competent firms in the Commonwealth, and shows that fifteen or twenty different samples of woollen goods were adulterated with from 21 per cent, to 49 per cent, of cotton, while blankets were adulterated with as much as 43 per cent, of cotton. I enter my protest against this protection, seeing that we have the raw material here. </para>

                    <para>- I have no objection to the honorable member appealing to the committee as many times as he chooses, but I strongly object to his allegation that I have dealt with him in any way that he is justified in characterising as unfair. Even when he had allowed an item to be passed I asked the Chairman, with the concurrence of the committee, to practically suspend the standing orders, in order that we might do something which we had I no right to do,, so that he should not have the slightest ground for complaint. I am sorry that he embraces every opportunity of charging me with unfairness. I would further point out that I never practically agreed that the difference between the duty upon piece goods and that upon the manufactured article should be 5 per cent. I did the reverse. I stated time after time that there should be at least a 10 per cent, difference. I . also told the committee that I intended to ask them to make the rate upon both lines 25 per cent. Whilst the honorable member, therefore, has a right to carry the vote against my proposal if he Can do so, he has no right to accuse either myself or my colleagues of having treated him unfairly.

                    <para>- I think that the arguments of the acting leader of the Opposition ought to be convincing. When the duties upon cotton piece goods were fixed at 10 and 15 per cent, under the Government proposals, the duty upon the manufactured article was set down at 25 per cent, and 20 per cent. Now that the duties upon these two great classes of goods have been lowered, it is astonishing that the Government should come forward and ask for a still further increase in the rate to be imposed upon the made - up goods. No argument has been advanced in justification of such a course, and I heartily concur with the amendment submitted by the honorable member for Wentworth. </para>

But every honorable member represents a constituency, and some honorable members may possess special knowledge upon particular items in the Tariff, and it would therefore be insufferable impertinence for me to tell the Prime Minister that I can bind the whole of ray party. </para>
