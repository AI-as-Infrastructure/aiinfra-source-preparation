                    <para>- When I was addressing the House on Tuesday night, in the middle of a lengthy passage, which required some observance of continuity in its delivery, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro made an interruption, which was entirely irrelevant, to this effect - "Were you not a protectionist in 1898?" to which I gave the flattest denial. He then said - " Were you not nominated by a protectionist association ? " to which also I gave the flattest denial. Last night the Minister for Home Affairs, notwithstanding these denials, again brought the matter before the. House - with characteristic magnanimity, in my absence. He affected to be unable to quote from a letter-- </para>

I am quite willing to admit that those honorable members who hold opinions different from mine on this all-important subject are equally honest in their intention to do likewise. I recognise the all-importance of this occasion when it is the desire of the members of this Parliament, if possible, to frame a Tariff which, we trust, will last for some years to come. Accepting that as the intention of honorable members-- </para>

The market of New -South Wales, now free to us, would be barred against us by the Federal Tariff ; and instead of that wider market which intercolonial free-trade would give for our fruit, jam, timber, oats, hay, straw, potatoes, woollen manufactures, &amp;c. , we should have a market even more restricted than that which now blights many of our industries. Whereas, New South Wales now imports large stocks of wheat, duty free, from India and San Francisco to replenish her stores, and so reduces her demand upon Australian granaries, she will under federation only receive that foreign wheat on payment of duty, and by so much the wheat exporting States will be protected. So will they be against New Zealand........... </para>

                    <para>Last night the executive committee of the Workmen's Association for the Defence of British Industry held their first meeting since the return of their secretary from the United States. That gentleman gave at considerable length his experience of that country, where he addressed thirty large meetings. Amongst other things, he stated that it was very hard to make American working men believe that their English brothers had any voice in the government of this county, as the first question ho was invariably asked was, "How is it possible for English working men to have control of the laws that regulate the Tariff, and yet continue to admit the productions of other countries duty free ? " This was a question which he was unable to answer. He said he did not believe the Sackville incident had much to do with the result of the presidential election. </para>

I recollect that in the case of the quotations given by the honorable and learned member for Indi exactly the same doubts were expressed. Every authority is bogus and a sham, even if it be a free-trade authority, if it does not agree with the opinions of the honorable member. At any rate, this man went to America as a free-trader, and gave a faithful report of the condition of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- A low Tariff or a high Tariff might be particularly bad or good for the people of the country ; it all depends upon the manner in which the imposts are arranged. I have stated that I am in disagreement with the Government in the incidence in some respects of the proposed taxation. We were told by the honorable member for Parkes that we could have a low Tariff, but I did not hear him state that he was prepared to let the different States go short : which meant that while he would have a low Tariff, he would practically knock out the free-list altogether. Now, sir, I believe that the problem can be solved, and I am prepared to take a hand in_ solving it. I am prepared at least to fix a Tariff that will, as far as lies in our power, suit the different producing interests of the whole Commonwealth of Australia. Because I desire, as I think other honorable members desire, that the Tariff framed at this juncture, should be the settled policy of Australia for a considerable time to come. I have always thought, and think now, that what this country wants is a settled fiscal policy. It was the idea of those, who promulgated federation that such a result would follow ; and I hope that when this Tariff is determined it will be one that will bear equally upon all classes within the Commonwealth and that it will remain the settled policy of the country. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose I should not expect them to be very careful after the exposure which some- of their leaders suffered last night at the hands of the Minister for Home Affairs. One of their chief objections to the protectionist policy is that it leads to the formation of rings and trusts, and other unholy business combinations. They would lead us to believe that that is a state of affairs peculiar to a protectionist country. It happens, however, that this is not the case. It was brought under my notice recently that a very substantial ring had been formed in Great Britain with the object of controlling the wall-paper trade of the world. For years English manufacturers had had practically the entire control of the world's markets- for wall - papers, and so successful had they been in their operations that they determined to form a combination  or ring and in that way secure' better prices. According to the information I have received the ring was formed something less than three years ago, but with a very startling result to the English manufacturers. The Germans had been endeavouring for some time to get the colonial markets for wall-papers, with paper somewhat smaller iu the average size than that of English manufacture. But when they found that the British ring had put up prices in the way I have described they altered the whole of their machinery, and they are now ready to supply orders for wall-papers of English pattern and size for the Australasian market. I have no doubt that they will do a large business here. A friend of mine has found himself forced to give an order to a German firm, notwithstanding that he is one of the sturdiest of Britishers. He was led to do so, because the English ring have entered into an arrangement whereby they will supply only five houses in Victoria, and unless my friend buys from one of these he cannot obtain the English wall-papers. These houses demand middlemen's profits, which he does not feel inclined to pay, and thus, in spite of his British predilections, he has been compelled to place a very large order for wall-papers with a German firm. </para>

                    <para>No ; the machines have not made things any better for the shirt stitchers, they have made tilings worse. I have a friend in the business - an old woman - 25 years ago she was paid 3s. 9d. each for first-class shirts sewn by hand. Now, at the same shop, she is paid 3d. each for machining. Working by hand, she used to earn 3s. a day ; now she only earns ls. But the shirt factories are the worst. There the hands work in great rooms, often in old and abandoned buildings, which are cold and damp, and the prices are shameful, and the conduct of the place by the managers generally vile. A woman will have to be very strong and clever to earn os. a week there. In some parts of this city there ave stylish looking places where they employ shirt makers. These poor creatures work in damp and miserable cellars, under the showy shop, and have to work very hard and very well if they can earn 4s. per week. I know an old woman who employs about twenty girls. They work in a dismal little cellar, where they are crowded together from eight in the morning till seven at night, with only half-an-hours interval. They do not earn above 3s. 6d. per week. It is all machine work. How do they live? God knows, poor creatures. Many of their lives are martyrdoms, many of them are simply tales of shame. There is a man in Gorton who employs a lot of these poor slaves on work for the best houses. He charges the girls ls. a week for the use of the machines. He charges ls. whether they work a full week or not. He charges them Id. per week for rent. He charges them Id. a week for coal. He makes them pay for machine-oil out of their own pockets. He compels them to buy their cotton off him, charging them 8Jd. for two cops, which they could buy in the shops for 7d., and he pays them 7d. a dozen for making men's shirts. The work is very laborious. After nine or ten hours, in a close room, at the machine a woman is shaken and wearied, her hands are unsteady, her eyes smart, her headaches, she has no life or spirit left in her. </para>

                    <para>We have lost or are losing some trades directly through bad legislation. The tobacco, printing, and electric industries are instances of this. Once Ireland had flourishing tobacco plantations. These were purposely killed in order that the tobacco industry in om- then American colonies might be fostered. Our erstwhile colonies are now a rival nation, but the revenue restrictions still make tobacco growing here practically impossible. There is no reason, climatic or other, why Ireland to-day should not produce great tobacco crops. A short Act of Parliament fostering the home growth of tobacco by a simplification of the collection of duty, and a rebate or even temporary remission of taxes on tobacco grown within the Kingdom, would create a new industry in Ireland at a bound. Some of us would, as a matter of taste, prefer the leaf of the nicotine grown in Kilkenny to Schleswig-Holstein cabbages doctored and browned in Hamburg. </para>

I asked the Customs department to prepare for me some figures as to all British colonial possessions and the increase of German trade.

                        <para>- Exactly. The statement furnished to me by the Customs department shows the value of goods imported d directly into British possessions from Germany in certain years. I take India as a case in ' point. The value of goods sent direct from Germany to India in 1877 was £9,000. In 1887, ten years later, the figures had risen to £160,000, and in 1896 to £2,353,000. So that in twenty years there was an increase of direct trade with India from £9,000 to £2,353,000. Take Canada, as affording the next example. Twenty years ago the country had a direct German trade of £77,000, whereas the trade now amounts to £1,250,000. Twenty years ago the direct German trade with Australia amounted to £9,800, whilst to-day it reaches the large amount of £1,574,000. Thus it can be seen that the German trade has been increasing with these three countries at a very great rate indeed, and what is true regarding Australia, Canada, and India, is equally correct in the cases of the Cape, the Straits Settlements, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, Newfoundland, Jamaica, Trinidad, Tasmania, and New Zealand. Of course it may be objected that although the German trade has increased in that way, so, also, has British trade increased, as the population of the British possessions has become larger. I anticipated that objection, and I asked the Customs department to supply me with figures on that head. I have not been able to get the statistics for India and Canada, but fortunately I have secured them so far as they relate to Australia. The return shows that while in 1887 the direct export trade from Great Britain to Australia amounted to £20,000,000, it was in 1896 £19,000,000 or £1,000,000 less. During the period from 188 7 to 1896 the percentage of increase in the German trade with Australia was 134 per cent., whilst the percentage of British decrease was 5-l per cent. Thus the German trade has enormously increased, whilst the trade of Great Britain, with her own possessions, has decreased, and I think these figures prove conclusively that the interjection I made was hot beside the mark, but, on the other hand, was justified. </para>

                        <para>- I said that the increase of trade was due to protection ; as one of the methods of fostering local industry in Germany is by means of fiscal protection. The industries of Germany have been brought into existence by the fiscal policy of that country- they have been further assisted by a splendid system of technical colleges, and as a result her manufacturers now export their goods to every market in the world, and have practically captured the major -portion of what used .to be British trade with British possessions. </para>

                        <para>- That is the argument to be deduced from the statements contained in the book, and from the figures supplied by our own Customs department. The honorable member for .Parramatta made one statement about myself, regarding which I wish to say a word or two. He said that even the honorable member for Bourke was in the old days a free-trader and, he believed, an ardent single taxer. May I take this opportunity of saying that I have never, during the whole course of my political life, been a free-trader or a single taxer. It is true that I have been, as I am still, for certain purposes, a great believer in the taxation of land values, but I challenge the honorable member to show, or to get any one to support his contention, that I have ever been anything else but a protectionist, as far as fiscalism is concerned. If the honorable member looks up the reports of the debates which took place in this House in connexion with the discussion of the Victorian Tariff, he will find that I have always voted for protection, and supported that policy. </para>

                        <para>- It is a peculiar thing that in Victoria it is the protectionists who are land taxes, whilst in New South Wales it is the free-traders, or, at any rate, some of them, who advocate that form of taxation. Whilst I have challenged the honorable member to prove his statement regarding myself, I may point out that it is singular that the honorable member should be open to criticism upon the very point upon which he has attacked me. The honorable member - I will not say wilfully or designedly, sought to damage me with my constituents by endeavouring to make it appear that I had once been a free-trader, and was therefore not to be relied upon now as a protectionist. </para>

He had large iron works of his own in the vicinity of the shaft, yet notwithstanding, he imported the whole of the tubing from Belgium at a cost of 18s. per ton cheaper than he could produce it at his own works, and when spoken to by some of the workmen, who at that time were working two days per week, he complacently remarked that he was buying in the cheapest market as. a free-trader 'should do. </para>

                    <para>Iron is the secret and source of manufacturing success. There was a time when all the iron Canada used came from Great Britain. It is not so now. Some ten years ago the Iron and Steel Institute visited the United States, and many of its members came into Canada. The secretary - reputed one of the cleverest statisticians of England, a high authority in the iron trade - made a speech in Ottawa, in which he was reported to have said - " Canada professes great friendship for England, and great loyalty to the Empire, but she has put on heavy duties on the importation of English iron, and that is not in keeping with her professions." On reading- that speech, the next morning I said to some members of the Institute whom I met : - "Has that secretary of yours gone through the United States with his eyes shut ? Anybody but a fool must see that to-day it is not a question whether we shall get our iron from England or not, but whether we shall take it from the United States or make it ourselves, and Canada has decided to make it herself." As I have stated, practically all the iron and iron products imported into Canada, came from Great Britain. Fifteen years ago, of the imports of pig iron, 70 per cent, were still from Great Britain, and 30 from the United States.

                        <para>- I would not for a moment differ from the Attorney-General on that point. The fact remains that under our Constitution we have the right to impose taxation in any way we think fit. Though I was one of those who opposed the Constitution Bill for various reasons, I said that I was glad that it contained this provision. I think the Bill was right in granting that power to the Parliament, and in giving the people of Australia absolute control over the mode in which revenue should be raised. So that I do not object to the proposals, of the Government so much because they are of a protectionist character, or because they are of a revenue producing character, as because they do "not provide . for any direct taxation. It will not be necessary for me to point out at any great length the distinguishing features of direct and indirect taxation. The principal reason why I am in favour of direct taxation is that there is practically no leakage of revenue from it.. In connexion with indirect taxation there is not only the cost of collecting the revenue through Custom-houses, and the rest of! the necessary machinery, but there is also the profit that is made out of the duty that is levied. I suppose that every honorable member will agree that that criticism applies to such, portions of the Tariff proposals as are merely revenue producing. Even those who claim to be revenue tariffists will admit that not only have the people of the country to pay the amount of money that the Government requires, but also a certain amount of profit on the extra money that is laid out by the merchant in consequence of the duties.. We are all agreed in that as far as concerns the revenue producing portion of the Tariff. The revenue tariffists have to admit what I have stated, and of course the protectionists admit it also. There are, however, some protectionists who argue that the same objection does not apply to protective duties - that we do not in all cases owing to the operation of internal competition pay all the duty that is levied. But even the protectionists have to admit that in the case of duties which are not affected by internal competition - that is to say, in those industries in which it may be, perhaps, two or three years before manufacturing can be sufficiently developed to cause internal competition - the price of commodities is increased by a protective duty. That being so, I take it that the protectionist is prepared to admit that not only have we to pay the import duty, but also the added interest on that import duty. So that if we have to raise £9,000,000 through the Customs, it will be putting it extremely low to say that the people of this country have to pay not only the £9,000,000, but also  at. least £1,000,000 more to the importers or retailers. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Mernda shakes his head and says "No." In some cases much more than 10 per cent. has to be paid before the goods come to the consumer. I will mention one case. Some time ago, in New South Wales, before the Dibbs Tariff was removed, there was a duty of 2d. per lb. on jam-. In Broken Hill we were getting jams of excellent quality - the Glen E win and the Glen Osmond brands. A storekeeper at Broken Hill told me that these jams were at that time being sold foils. 3d. per 2-lb. tin. He said - "As soon as the duty of 4d. per 2-lb. tin is removed, we shall sell these jams for10d. per tin. That is, we now charge the 4d. duty, and the extra1d. for laying out the4d." That was 25 per cent. which the people had to pay on those jams. I am aware that if the Government requires money it must be raised through taxation in some way. I do not so much object to the 4d., in the case of these 2 - lb. tins of jam, going to the Government, but I do object to the people having to pay an extra penny, simply because some one else is' collecting that 4d. for the Government. By the time the wholesale man has paid the duty and has sent the goods to the retailer, who has to make his profit, it is an exceedingly low estimate to say that the people of this country will have to pay £1,000,000 in addition to the £9,000,000 being raised through the Custom-house. But in the case of direct taxation there is no profit made by any one. The whole duty collected goes straight into the coffers of the State. Then again, I venture to say that there will be no disputing the fact that direct taxation is certainly more just as a means of raising revenue than taxes imposed through the Customs, whether those duties be of a revenue producing or of a protective character. Who is it that is called upon to bear the overwhelming proportion of customs duties ? If we put that question to ourselves we shall come to the conclusion speedily that they must necessarily be borne by the masses, and not by the classes. I do not suppose, for example, that as a rule a rich man drinks a great deal more than does an artisan in the course of twelve months. Of course, if he drinks champagne he pays more duty than the worker. But there are some rich men who are teetotallers, so that, as a matter of fact, such a man would pay less actually than the artisan who, while extremely temperate, was not a teetotaller. If we take 100 rich men and 100 artisans, the probability is that we shall find that in the course of twelve months the latter pay as much as the rich men in the way of duties on stimulants and narcotics. Take the wife of the rich man and the wife of the artisan. The wife of the one probably would not drink any more than the wife of the other ; but, when we come to the consumption of rice, we find that the artisan and the worker generally consume far more than the rich man. The artisan has a better appetite than the rich man, and, consequently, by means of the duties on such articles he is called upon to pay more of the taxation of the country. Customs duties must necessarily come out of the stomachs and from the backs of the workers ; and, although the rich people may use a little better furniture and wear superior clothing, in no way is the taxation which they are called upon to bear commensurate with their banking accounts. We are all agreed that under a mere revenue-producing Tariff the people pay more than the duty. They have to pay the profit which is made by the imposition of the duty. Let us assume for a moment that so far as a protective duty is concerned, the consumer, in some cases, pays only the duty itself. We will concede for the sake of argument, that as the result of such a duty a local industry is established, internal competition takes place, and prices are brought down. If an article can be produced locally, however, and sold at a price below that for which it could be imported, where is the necessity for the imposition of a duty? The fact that a duty remains upon an article should in itself be sufficient proof that there is some need for it. On some articles, however, the people must necessarily pay the whole duty, otherwise the Government proposals would bring in no revenue. Not only have they to pay the duty, but, as I have said, they have to bear the added amount of profit. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that the whole of the protective duties balance - that is to say that the people have to pay the duties and nothing more - we have still to consider what is the effect of a protected industry upon the primary industries of the Commonwealth. When I speak of primary industries, I refer to agriculture and mining, which are, in my opinion, the two great primary industries of Australia. I use the word agriculture in its widest and fullest sense. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that point presently. If we killed our two great primary industries then within a few weeks this continent would be handed over to the undisputed possession of the aboriginals. I do not know whether the honorable and learned member for Werriwa is present, but during the course of the debate he made an interjection in regard to the champagne provided by the manufacturers of Melbourne on the occasion of visits paid to their establishments by Members of Parliament. I am sorry that such an interjection should have been made. I was one of those who accepted the invitation of the manufacturers of Melbourne to view their places of business. I desired to see them for myself, and I was very pleased with a great deal of what I saw. As a matter of fact, however, I did not drink any champagne, because I am a total abstained. If I had not been a teetotaller I should have partaken of it with the rest. Passing from that matter, I want to point out that there are some protected industries which would have no effect upon the primary industries of the Commonwealth. Take the shirt,' boot, and umbrella making trades, for example. The manufacture of umbrellas is a very big business here, and the manufacture of boots is another large trade. If, under a protectionist Tariff, we had to pay more for a shirt than we would pay for it under a freetrade policy, that fact would affect only the buyer, because, so far as I know, a shirt is made to be worn and does not enter into any other province as raw material. There are some manufactured articles, however, which come within the category of raw materials, and are used as such in other industries. Bar-iron might be cited as an example. The honorable member for New England made a speech on the motion before the Chair, which, I am sure, we were all pleased to hear, but he concluded with the remarkable statement that, while he was in favour of allowing the raw article to come in free, he would support the protection of the manufactured article. As a representative of no small mining constituency, I do not care very much about the manufactured article, provided that the Government allow the raw material to come in free. But what is the raw material of the miner in Broken Hill { It is the engine and the machine, and not the bar-iron. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is. I know that some people say, that under protection we can have these engines and machines developed here. Victoria is quoted, and it is said that in Victoria we have been able to produce some of the best gold saving machinery in the world under the system of protection. I believe that up to a little time ago some of the best gold saving machinery produced in any place in the world could be produced in Victoria, but that was simply because Bendigo and Ballarat developed that particular kind of machinery, and there was no great competition elsewhere. But immediately the Johannesburg mines were opened up, British and American capital swept into them, and I venture to say that a very short time afterwards the machinery out here was as out of date for gold saving as are horse trams for traction in every civilized place in the world, except Adelaide. To show how special requirements develop means of meeting them, I might point to Martin Brothers' establishment at Gawler. They have been able to develop and to manufacture a first-class concentrating machine. Why? Because of their proximity to the Broken Hill mines, and the knowledge of the requirements of those mines which they' have been able to gain there. But, so little has protection helped them, that not long ago one of the members of the firm told me that he had been begging the others to leave Gawler, and establish the foundry in Sydney. Whilst I am glad to see people employed in factories, T say that it is suicidal to develop, say, a foundry at the expense of a mine, because, while in the foundry yon may give employment to 50 men, by sacrificing the mine you throw 400 or 500 men out of employment. No other industry affords such varied and extensive avenues of employment as mining does, because it employs not only the miner, but also the carpenter, the tradesman, the engine-driver, the fitter, and many other artisans. One reason why I object to protective duties is this : If a mine does not pay it is shut down ; but if a woollen factory does not pay with the assistance of 15 per cent, duties, the proprietor asks for and obtains 25 per cent, duties. The mining, agricultural, and pastoral community has to pay to keep the woollen manufactory and other protected industries going ; but it is never proposed to subsidize a mine which does not pay. </para>

                        <para>- Very little further. I aim glad to say that they have recently established a State mine in South Australia. At present it employs only three men and a l)oy, but I am in favour of the owning of mines by a State, and have been greatly interested in the information which I have received in regard to that mine by the South Australian Minister of Mines. If I were forced to vote for some kind of indirect taxation, I should support revenue duties rather than protective duties, though to my mind both are bad, unjust, and cruel. I would support revenue duties before protective duties for this reason: To-day, the amendment which I have moved may be scoffed at and negatived, but the time will come when this Parliament will have to face the question of imposing direct taxation, and when that time comes it will be easier for the advocates of direct taxation to gain their ends, if only revenue duties are imposed now, than if vested interests are created under protective duties. If protective duties are put on, and manufactories are established under them, the advocates of direct taxation will then have to fight not only the wealthy and conservative members of the community ; they will have to fight also the manufacturers and the workers employed in protected factories. A little over 25 years ago in New South Wales duties were placed upon sugar, purely for revenue purposes, but some people thought that they could profitably produce sugar under those duties, and they did so. I have heard protectionists say that if an industry is protected for a little while, it will be able after a time to stand by itself. I do not know that that is an accepted protectionist doctrine at the present time, but it used to be so. Well, notwithstanding the fact that the New South Wales sugar duties had been in existence for 25 years, it was marvellous what a row was kicked up when the present leader of the Opposition, who was then in power, threatened to remove them. Talk about weaning a- baby ; this 25-year-old baby made a terrible low at being weaned. Those interested in the industry said - "If you take away the duties you will kill the sugar industry." The Trades and Labour Council of Melbourne have asked that duties should not be placed upon the necessaries of life, and I am in favour of that, unless by removing such duties it becomes necessary to place higher duties upon raw material, and thus make the price of that raw material dearer, and increase the difficulties of those who have to use it. The artisans and fitters of Melbourne, for instance, would strongly object to duties being placed upon the raw material of their trade - iron and steel bars - and I think they would be right in doing so ; but to the miners of Broken Hill the engine - the machine - is the raw article. I know that revenue must be raised in some way or other. The system of indirect taxation is wasteful and unjust. Who is it that gains by the expenditure of money ? I venture to say that it is the land-owner who gains by the expenditure of all loan money. Every railway which is built, and every road which is made, gives a benefit to the labourer and to the storekeeper for a little while. The labourer earns his wage by the day, perhaps, while a railway or a road is being made, and he gains that benefit ; but afterwards neither one nor the other adds anything to a man's wages. It does not add any particular advantage to the storekeeper, the mechanic, or the labourer, but it does add to the value of the land. As I understand, the amount which is wanted for federal purposes, plus the loss on the transferred services, is about £1,700,000. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Braddon blot that is so. In France, where the Government have to pay a great deal for their big army, the rate of taxation through the Custom-house was a little under £1 per head. I find that the French Government make a profit of £20,000,000 a year on tobacco. I suppose it would be only fair, in a way, to put that against the excise here. The people of Australia have to pay the excise and the profit, but there the Government reap the benefit, which is a more sensible arrangement. With that added, the rate would be £1 7s. per head. In the United States the rate was 13s. per head, if we take simply the revenue from import duties ; but, of course, they have a large internal revenue - I suppose it is mostly excise - and that would increase the rate to £1 9s. per head. I am in full accord with the honorable member for Bland on one point. I am not in favour of raising through the Custom-house one penny more than the £1,700,000 we require for federal purposes, plus what must be raised by the Braddon blot. I am a little sorry that the leader of the Opposition has not said in the House - he may do so before the debate is closed - whether he is prepared to raise only that amount, or whether he will raise revenue for the necessities of the States as well. It is an extremely unfair position for a Federal Parliament to be placed in - to have to raise more money than is needed owing to the necessities of the States - for this reason, that we shall have the blame of raising the money, while the State Parliaments will have the credit of spending it. That is like " playing heads I win and tails you lose." I am prepared to oppose the raising of more than the amount needed for federal purposes, plus what the Constitution demands. On spirits and narcotics we raise £4,000,000 a year. I am not particularly in favour of raising revenue even on narcotics and spirits, although. I admit that the taxation is partly moral and partly fiscal. I do not drink, nor do I smoke, consequently I do not contribute to that sum. I do not particularly object to others contributing to it if they choose. A man is very foolish to allow his whisky to be taxed and to permit my ginger-ale to come in free. If he is prepared to do it, I do not see why I should go out of my way to grumble very much. That will give us. £1,000,000 a year. </para>

                        <para>- Without any exemptions ; of course if the figures are not right some one can correct them to-morrow. A tax of a1/4d. in the £1 on the unimproved value of land without any exemptions would yield about £350,000. We should still require toraise£350,000 more. Through the Custom-house, if we wished to raise that amount, we should have to raise £1,400,000 more under the Braddon blot. That would give us a Customs revenue of £5,400,000. If £350,000 were to be raised by direct taxation, I should not bother very much about whether the Tariff were revenue producing or protectionist. </para>

                        <para>- I think he did, and on the ground that the land would receive a particular benefit from federation. We were promised a great deal of benefit from federation. I hope that all the benefit which was promised by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and others, will be obtained. I did not think it would, but still I hope that I was wrong and that they were right. At any rate, if the land is to be improved in value as the outcome of federation, it is a fair thing that revenue should be raised by a tax upon it. We may be told that the States would be impoverished, but I think I am right in saying that the honorable and learned member for Indi stated at the Federal Convention, when speaking about the way in which Western Australia would be affected by the reduction of the revenue collected through the Customs, that if the people were not taxed in that way the money would be left in their pockets. That was reported to have been said by the honorable and learned member, but whether he said it or not, I believe in the correctness of that view. If you do not take money out of the pockets of the people through customs duties, the money must remain in their pockets. I venture to say that a land tax affords a just, fair, and equitable means of raising revenue ; besides which it would stimulate enterprise, and thus tend to provide employment. If you tax a man's land you compel him to make some use of it in order that he may be able to pay the tax. There was a great deal of land in New South Wales and other States of which no use was made until a land tax was imposed, but when taxation had to be paid, those who held land had to do something with it, and they thus provided employment for the people. If there are any free traders in this House I would like to see them support this resolution. There is as much difference between free-trade and revenue tariffism as there is between protection and revenue tariffism, and for a man to say he is a free-trader and at the same time a revenue tariffist is to take up a position which is a delusion, a. snare, and a mockery. . Some time ago, in New South Wales, there was a band of very able men who believed in free-trade ; and it is to their credit that, under the* leadership of the right honorable the leader of the Opposition, they carried out their policy. Whether they were right or wrong, they did what they believed to be the proper thing. They went into Parliament to reduce the customs duties, and they did so. They did not remove the duty on boots, and put it on rice ; but they reduced the duties, and raised revenue by putting a tax upon the land. These men believed in free-trade, and it is argued by them to-day that New South Wales is better off because of the free-trade policy" that was then adopted. If free-trade is a good thing for New South Wales it must be a good thing for the Commonwealth, and the only way in which we can secure freetrade is by resorting to direct taxation. I confess that I admire the magnificent pluck and heroism of John Bright when he took the action he did some 50 yearS ago. Freetrade in England then was not the thing to swear by that it is to-day, but there was tremendous opposition to it, which went so far that on a certain afternoon a number of land-owners met and subscribed £250,000' with which to fight John Bright. He advocated free-trade - not revenue tariffism. He was a free-trader ; he was prepared to remove customs duties, and he wanted to tax not only the land', but property generally. If there are any free-traders left in this House I would ask them to support this resolution, and if there are any protectionists here who have the courage to protect, I would like them to support it. I do not regard a man as a protectionist if he is prepared to impose only duties of 10 per cent, or 15 percent., and allow goods to come in here subject only to a slight restriction. The natural corollary to protection is a land tax. There are some members who say that this Tariff is not high enough, because it will allow certain imports to come in, and from the point of view of the protectionist that is a perfectly correct attitude to take. I admire the man who is sincere in his political professions, and I do not care what a man is so long as he is whole-hearted and logical. If there is a true protectionist here I claim his support, because I hold that the only way in which we can get protection is through direct taxation. . Believing that to raise £9,000,000 through the Customs would impose very heavy burdens upon the community, and that a land tax would afford us an equitable mode of raising revenue, I hope my amendment will meet with cordial support. </para>

                        <para>- That is for them to decide. I was going to say that that is the position to which I still adhere, notwithstanding my honorable friend's arguments. We cannot support this amendment, because the Government and the Opposition parties were united in indicating that the revenue of the Commonwealth must, at any rate, at this stage of our history, be raised from customs and excise, and because it is the bounden duty of the Commonwealth to guard against the possibility of any serious embarrassment to the States. If it does not do so, it abandons its position of trustee to the whole of the States during the bookkeeping period, and it can only abandon its trusteeship at its own peril, because the impairment or ruin of the credit of one State would impair that credit which we must maintain for the nation as a whole. That is a result which we cannot permit to be brought about. Therefore, taking it for granted that it was the consensus of opinion on the part of the Government and of the Opposition that the whole of the revenue of the Commonwealth - at this stage, at any rate - should be raised from customs and excise, I say that that revenue must be such as to prevent any undue embarrassment to the States. Let us go a point beyond that. There is another aspect of this duty of preserving the credit of the States. We have so to adjust the burdens of taxation as to leave to them the capacity to raise for themselves any shortage which may be imposed upon them as the result of the operation of our Tariff. It is impossible- as has been indicated - to frame any Tariff which will supply to all the States-- </para>

                        <para>- I was going to urge that this tax is submitted as a part substitute - as the honorable member for the Barrier put it - for the duties proposed to be raised by customs and excise. It involves the question in itself of whether it is an efficient substitute - efficient for those needs which all parties recognise must be satisfied. That is the whole extent to which I wish to go. It is important that in raising our revenue we should not, to any degree that is not positively and absolutely necessary, trespass upon any taxable capacity of the States which might enable them to supply any shortages that result from our Tariff proposals. I do not wish to advert to those proposals any more than to point out that it is impossible to satisfy the greatest needs of the States, because that would involve an unheard-of revenue being raised from the source I have indicated. The course, therefore, which is possible and practicable is the medium course, which may leave some shortages. Without going over the old ground, or traversing the old figures,, it will be clearly seen that those States which will be left with shortages by this Tariff must have a field of taxation, from which to put their finances in a proper position. If the field is trespassed upon as is now proposed, by so much is it rendered more difficult for each State that is short to preserve its solvency and its credit. That is, I take it, the whole point involved in the amendment. We are not concerned to dispute that land taxation may sometimes be necessary. There are those of us who, if we look into this matter, must foresee that in some of the States, at any rate, a greater degree of internal direct taxation is necessary. The sole reason is that the whole of the ordinary powers of taxation provided by Customs and excise are given to the Commonwealth, and the States cannot, as States, have any voice as to how those powers shall be exercised, and if the result of the unaided exercise of our rights, which are the rights of the whole Commonwealth. leaves the States with a shortage, then to enter on the other field of taxation - one that belongs to us as much as to the States, but one which morally we ought to leave to the States as much as possible - would impair their credit and their ability to satisfy the needs of their own Treasurers. It is not for us to say that in this or that State there is extravagance. We are not here to rectify the internal finances of the States, but simply to return to them, subject to the needs of the Commonwealth, as much as we can in order to prevent their being placed in an improper position. If the States choose to " outrun the constable," and to enormously increase extravagant expenditure, so that anything in reason the Commonwealth Government do is not sufficient for them, it must be their responsibility to make up the balance. But even if the Governments and the Parliaments of the States do not recognise their duty, we have. still to remember that the solvency of the States is the solvency of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, we should not subtract from them any reasonable field of taxation by means of which they can rehabilitate their finances. If, having that proper field, the States do not choose to resort to it, that may be their mistake, but it is not our business to interfere. On the other hand, if the Commonwealth Government, having the main sources of revenue, resort to other sources and take it out of the power of the States to rectify anything that needs rectification, then we begin to be chargeable, because we have entered on a domain which at the present time we ought to leave to them, in order that their individuality as contracting States may be maintained in full strength. No one desires that the States should become crawling dependents, on the Commonwealth for grants ; we do not want anything of that kind to occur. The position, as I pointed out, is a temporary one. It will exist, at any rate, during the bookkeeping period, and it may exist later. The movements Of trade which will follow the abolition of the Inter-State barrier scan not be foreseen. We can only make the best attempt that our present knowledge opens up to us to provide for the contingencies of a few years, but the position of the States financially will probably differ very much from the position in which they stand now in relation to each other. The States which at present have the greatest consuming capacity may tend to equality, and those with less consuming capacity may make some advance to their level. All these are matters which must be observed and watched ; and it may be that at the end of a few years we shall find ourselves in a better position to say what should be done in regard to direct taxation. But the needs of the States compel both parties to take the position that the Customs and Excise shall be, for the present, the sole source of revenue. We are pledged to that course on the Government side of the House, and honorable members on the opposition side are similarly pledged, so far as the voice of a leader can represent the voice of a party. I take it that that pledge was given on the considerations I have pointed Out, which apply to the finances of the Commonwealth irrespective of free-trade and protection, and apply as much to one party as to the other. Under these circumstances, therefore, without expressing too much opposition to land value taxation, which, as I say, the necessities of the Commonwealth itself may some day render necessary, I point out that as the necessities of the Commonwealth do not at the present moment render such taxation necessary, it is better to leave the States in possession of that confidence and security which they will have when there is this source of revenue to make up for possible financial necessities. Having said that, I do not think I need prolong the debate further than to say that I shall not find myself in a position to vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I realize that this debate is pretty well exhausted. We have had speeches of undue length from some members of the Opposition, and we are now in the third week of the debate. Were I to consult my own personal feelings, or were I to consider the time of the House, I should not speak, but I feel I have a duty to perform on an occasion like this. I represent a constituency which is made up largely of farmers, and the Tariff, which we are now considering, will very seriously affect that class. I have heard honorable members on the opposition side state that the Tariff, as proposed, will be of no benefit to the farming community. In fact, we have been challenged to show in what way the Tariff will benefit the farmer. I accept that challenge, and I shall prove that the Tariff will be of immense advantage to the farmer, and particularly to that class of farmer which I have the honour to represent. One thing has struck me very forcibly during the progress of this debate. We have heard able speeches from honorable members on both sides of the House, but I am sorry to say that there are some honorable members sitting in opposition who have not refrained from indulging in the grossest misrepresentation. We all anticipated that when the Tariff proposals were submitted to the House, there would be a fight, but some of us, at any rate, expected that the fight would be carried on in a fair and honorable manner. We have not only had misrepresentation from honorable members on the opposition side, but we have found those misrepresentations backed up by that section of the press which supports the policy of the Opposition. We have had the spectacle of the leader of the Opposition telling the House and the country that this Tariff has been framed purely in the interests of the Victorian manufacturer. That is a splendid start ; and we now hear that statement cheered by members of the Opposition. This Tariff has not been framed in the interests of "Victorian manufacturers. If the Tariff resembles the Tariff of Victoria more closely than it does the Tariff of New South Wales, that is simply because the former is found more suited to the circumstances of the Commonwealth. But the statement has been taken up by a section of the free-trade press in Sydney, and sent broadcast from one end of the land to the other. </para>

                    <para>I have stated the case with regard to New South Wales, but New South Wales will have to make a sacrifice more or less. You cannot expect to convert five other colonics to your fiscal system because you intend to federate, and we New South Welshmen must make some compromise, so long as it is not disastrous in regard to this fiscal matter, or we can not federate at all. The more clearly that is seen, and the more people begin to realize it, the less dissatisfaction will there be when the federation comes about ; because you must recollect this, that this is one of the most difficult federations that has ever taken place in the world, notwithstanding all the difficulties of Swiss and Canadian federation. We have here five or six large, unwieldy states in this great island continent of Australia, separated sofar from one another that there is the danger in the early periods of our federation that certain contingencies may occur which will strain that union to the very utmost. </para>

                <para>Therefore, it is an absolutely necessary condition precedent that, in all matters that affect the industrial life and the pockets of the people, they should know clearly and fully the bargain that they are about to make. Now, I say most unmistakably, in spite of all these difficulties, that union is worth the price. And, speaking as a free-trader, and without any disrespect to others, I believe that the way of looking at the Tariff of the future, when we come together as one great Australian people, will be far higher, more national, and broader than we have looked at that question in our isolated communities. </para>
                <para>If we do not have free-trade with the outside world, we will have free-trade among ourselves; and, as population increases - although probably not to such an extent for many years as in the United States of America, we will have the same great factor which we find there, and which, to a certain extent, has kept protection from its evil effects, the fact that although they have protection against the outside world, they have a world in themselves in which trade is absolutely free. </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The actual position is this : That in some of these colonies - and the delegates speak with all the knowledge and experience of their people, gained by their political position - that there is no means of forcing direct taxation any further than it has gone. It is a very unfortunate thing torus in New South Wales, because you will clearly see that if there is embodied in this Constitution - as there is in the draft Bill up to the present time - a clause by which a certain surplus must be returned, a surplus based upon present actual conditions, it means that you must, whether you like it or not, create a Federal Tariff to bring in a certain volume of revenue. And what does that mean for us ? It means this - that New South Wales, if she joins this union, must agree to the re-imposition to a large extent of customs duties, whether they are purely for revenue or for protective purposes, which will be going back upon her present system of free-trade. There is no use shutting your eyes to that fact. People will say that we can create a Tariff which is not protective, but only revenue producing. I would like to ask the common sense of Australia whether, when six colonies joined together, and five are of one fiscal character, the sixth is likely to produce any effect upon that character when numbers are against it ? I say all this, not because I want to say anything against federation, but I say we want to go into this federation with our eyes open. </para>

                        <para>- That sum was mentioned as the new expenditure involved in federation. I do not think that the new expenditure involved in federation amounts to 2s. 6d. per head. So far as I know, the people were never told that the increased taxation due to the alteration which would be brought about by the adoption of a uniform Tariff would amount to only 2s. 6d. per head. When the statement was made that federation would cost the people 2s. 6d. per head the expense referred to was the expense connected with this Parliament, and any new expenses which might be due to the accomplishment of federation. There is an endeavour now - and this is where the press in Sydney is so very unfair - to make the people of New South Wales believe that the new expenditure involved is going to cost them 22s. 6d. per head, when we know that, in reality, the cost of the departments transferred, and which had been previously carried on by New South Wales is included in that estimate. </para>

                        <para>- I can go so far as to say that when New South Wales has lived under this Tariff for three years, she will be very pleased that she is in the federation. Every new system of taxation creates an outcry. I know that there was a sufficient number of people in New South Wales who were opposed to the Commonwealth Bill itself to make a huge outcry against any form of taxation, no matter how light it might have been. And when a large body of people like that is led by - what shall I say, a capable leader - by a leader as glib of tongue as the right honorable the leader of the Opposition, it is capable of swelling its ranks, and of causing a very large section to appear to be dissatisfied. But I undertake to say that when the people of New </para>

                    <para>The recently published official returns of the Board of Agriculture in England point to a steady and serious decline of the agricultural industry in the mother country. Within the last quarter of a century the wheat area has decreased by one-half, and within the twelve months an area about equal in extent to the county of Middlesex has disappeared from wheat cultivation. Although some of the causes of the falling off may be of a temporary character, the facts seem to point to the conclusion that there has been a steady decrease in wheat cultivation, which is not likely to be arrested. The stock statistics point in the same direction. In sheep the decline is very great, and the outlook for the agricultural industry is serious enough. </para>

                        <para>- I did not go into those particulars, but considerable quantities came from Tasmania and New Zealand, and possibly from Victoria. I am only quoting these figures to show the effect of the freetrade policy of New South Wales during a few years upon the agricultural industry. The excess of imports of potatoes was valued at £132,000, and such an amount of money distributed amongst the farmers of New South Wales would represent something very substantial. </para>

                        <para>- I would ask the honorable member to go to the statistical register for that information. I should like to refer briefly to what was put forward by the honorable member for Lang in reference to the timber industry. The honorable member made a comparison between New South Wales and Victoria with regard to this particular industry, and he evidently thought thai he had made a very strong point when he showed that the number of saw-mills in operation and the number of hands employed in New South Wales under free-trade exceeded those in Victoria. I should like to remind the House, however, that in New South Wales we have a coastline of 800 miles, which is practically dotted with saw-mills, whereas they have no such advantage in Victoria. Then, again, across the ranges in the west we have fine timber country, and along the Murray there are vast supplies of timber upon which we can draw. Therefore, it does not follow that, because there are more mills in operation and more hands employed in New South Wales than in Victoria, free-trade is therefore better than protection for the timber industry. Nature has been more bountiful in the supply of timber to New South Wales than to Victoria. The imports of timber into New South Wales - and I know honorable members will not want to know where this timber comes from - from countries outside the Commonwealth, exceeded the exports by the value of £736,871 during the years 1898, 1899, and 1 900. The imports from all countries, inclusive of the States of the Commonwealth, exceeded the exports by £1,029,784. I have heard honorable members say that only imported timber is suitable for use in mining operations. Whilst not venturing to give a positive opinion about the matter, I have a sufficient knowledge of timber to induce me to believe that our own timber can be used for mining purposes with as much advantage as imported timber. I will go so far as to say that if it can be shown that imported timber only is suitable for mining work, I shall be willing to give my vote in favour of allowing timber to be used for mining purposes to come in free. </para>

                        <para>- In 1895, when the present leader of the Opposition was revising the New South Wales Tariff, the only free-trade representative of the South Coast recorded his vote in favour of the retention of the duty upon butter. In regard to every other commodity he was a freetrader. The same thing occurred in regard to a representative of the Newcastle district. That honorable member was in favour of a duty upon biscuits and candles because there were biscuit and candle factories in his electorate, but in regard to everything else he was a free-trader. These are facts which cannot be denied. A great deal has been said about the sugar industry, and the leader of the Opposition, in his opening speech, intimated that he would have dealt with that industry in the same way as the Government propose to deal with it. I am pleased that the Ministry have grappled with this question, and have decided upon giving a preference to sugar grown by means of white labour as against that grown by black labour. I am glad to find that the cost to the consumer has been very little increased by the new duty which has been imposed. I was told on Monday that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had increased its price by £2 a ton. I visited two retailers and found that in some of the leading houses in Sydney the 70-lb. bag of sugar had increased in price by only1s. 3d. That is equal to £2 per ton. I also ascertained that the 4-lb. packages of sugar, which are sold by the small retailers, have increased in price from 9d. to 10d., or1/4d. per lb. I have been informed that some of the country storekeepers have increased the price of the bag which was formerly sold at 13s. to 20s. Whether that statement is true, I am not in a position to say. A great deal has been said about the boot trade in Sydney. Let me tell honorable members that as the result of the introduction of this Tariff it is the intention of the boot manufacturers of Sydney to increase the wages of their employes from to-morrow by 10 to 15 per cent., all round. It is also intended to improve the old woollen mills, which have been lying idle at Parramatta for so many years, and to resume operations there. I do not know whether that is a bad sign. </para>

Seven years ago he used to walk -into the old man " Parkes" like a tiger, because lie was still a fanatical free-trader ; but, as a man grew older, and got responsibilities, he got more broad in his opinions, and saw things a little more in their true proportion. He had now more than one idea. Where he used to have room only for the one idea of free-trade, he never used :to think of anything else now he thought of national union. </para>
                    <para>The right honorable gentleman did not say protection, but we can well see what he iliad in his mind when he made that speech. It was one of those speeches which we know so well in New South Wales, and which are delivered preparatory to the performance of a little political somersault. That somersault, however, was never performed, and now he stands on the Opposition side, and in vigorous terms condemns the Government for carrying out the policy which he himself would have had to introduce. I have said all I wish to say on this question. Much more might be said, but I feel that I have, at any rate, given voice to the sentiments and feelings of those whom I represent. Free-trade farmers there may be in my constituency, but they are few and far between. I am quite sure that the Tariff which has been introduced by the Government, while a Tariff for the farmers of my constituency, is also a Tariff which, with a little modification, will meet the requirements of the people of the Commonwealth. I wish, before concluding, to make a personal explanation. During the first part of my speech, I referred to an honorable member who had stated outside the precincts of the chamber that Ministers had been approached and bribed in a corrupt way to introduce this Tariff. At the time I asked the honorable member whether he was going to repeat the statement in the House, and he said he was. However, I have since had an opportunity of seeing the honorable member, and he assures me now that the remark was made jocularly. Had I not believed at the time that the honorable member was serious, I should not have mentioned the incident in the House, and, now having received an assurance that the remark was made jocularly, I regret very much having made any reference to the matter. </para>

                    <para>- Looking over some statistics lately I was rather startled to find that in one leading State of the Commonwealth there are no fewer than 1,157 people blind of an eye. On turning over the next page of the statistics I found the still more extraordinary fact that in the immediately adjoining State there are 1,164 people blind of an eye. I would not for worlds divulge the names of those States. It would be difficult enough for clear, wide eyed men with perfect sight, to look at all sides of a sex agon, and they cannot do it without shifting their stand-point. How, then, can we expect one-eyed men to do such a thing ? This Commonwealth has six sides, represented by the six States, and in order to get a true appreciation of the position we must look at them all. It appears to me that this debate is very much like a duel between New South Wales and Victoria. I am, I believe, the first Queenslander who has spoken on the subject, and we, who represent the other States, can, it appears to me, look more dispassionately on the position. We have 119 prejudices, np partialities. We do not trouble our heads where the federal capital is to be, because we know that it cannot be in our States. It does not hurt our self-love to hear Victoria praised, as she well deserves to be praised, for the wonderful development of her dairying and farming industry, or her wonderful position in regard to gold-mining ; nor are we jealous when we hear of the extraordinary expansion of the commercial industries of New South Wales. All States now belong to the Commonwealth. We can make ample allowance for New South Wales when we consider her large areas of barren country, and how much of her good lands are locked up in the hands of a few squatters. We are also prepared to make generous concessions to Victoria on account of the terrible disaster of the land boom, which, by the way, I do not think has been sufficiently taken into account in comparing the two States. What we do rejoice in is that now the Commonwealth embraces all the wealth, all the talents, and all the skill of all the States. A little while ago, we were cousins, often unfriendly, always suspicious. To-day we are partners, brothers, seeking for a common good. Yesterday we were six insignificant stream lets, meandering each our independent way. To-day we are a mighty flowing river, destined, I -hope, to fructify and bless the world. It is too early yet to call ourselves a great Commonwealth, but certainly we have great possibilities. Whether we shall achieve greatness depends on the wisdom that we shall write into our laws, and the justice with which we shall administer them. In considering this question of the Tariff, I do not wish to disparage Victoria, because I can say this honestly - that Victoria has done far more good to my State than have all the other States put together. I have the highest admiration for the Melbourne men in particular. I do not think that any one, however prejudiced he may be, can live in this city for any length of time, without admiring the noble buildings, the spacious streets, and the grand ideas of the Melbourne men. I have been in the habit of travelling every year for years past from the north down to Melbourne, and, because I have travelled with my eyes open, I have been compelled to notice changes which have come during that time. People who live in their own State and never go out of it, do not get an idea of the changes that take place by reading books or newspapers. But when one sees with ones own eyes the progress or the retrogress of a place, it impresses itself upon ones mind in such a way as; no book or newspaper can do. It is necessary for me at this time to make one comparison - between the two cities of Melbourne and Sydney. I shall only make one,, and then I shall have done with it. I choose the cities of Melbourne and Sydney for this, reason - Melbourne I take to be the exponent of protection, the stronghold o£ the manufacturer ; Sydney I take to be the champion of free-trade, the citadel of the primary producer. </para>

                <para>There is a curiously large proportion of London paupers who live well beyond the average span of life. A short time ago half a dozen lively centenarians were counted among them. Perhaps their tenacity is due to the regularity of their habits and the severe simplicity of their food, since doctors say there are virtues in these things. And this leads one to fear for the health and prospects of longevity of a certain male pauper, who, by a strange and amusing chance, is just now the sole inmate of a work-house at Bermondsey, a south-eastern suburb of London. There are no fewer than 28 officials to look after him - a master, a matron, a medical officer, two chaplains, and over a score nurses and other attendants ! If he were to take his discharge, the whole staff would be out of employment. It is to their interest to make him entirely at home and contented, but in their zealous anxiety they may overdo it. And the worst of it is, that the old fellow himself seems to over-look this aspect of the case. It was reported at the last meeting of the local board of guardians that he was enjoying the situation immensely. </para>

                        <para>- I think starch is out of it this time. I am no revolutionary, and I am opposed on principle to all fiscal protection - indeed, to all protection except that of public health and morals, and purity of race. But if honorable members opposite persist in subsidizing manufacturers unjustly and illegitimately, and only city manufacturers at that - not the poor struggling manufacturers in the country - if they persist in doing this at the expense of the masses, I say that it is simple justice that the masses should divide the profits, or share the losses if there are any. That, to me, appears to be an argument conclusively and absolutely irresistible. It will be said that this idea is visionary and impossible. But I reply that it has been done. Prance has enjoyed an annual revenue of £12,000,000 of money out of her tobacco monopoly, and I know that Spain for many years enjoyed a very handsome revenue from the same source - though I am afraid she does not enjoy very much now. I think that if this alternative were submitted to these beneficent manufacturers, not in Victoria alone, but throughout the whole of Australia/ - because they are all " tarred with the same brush " ; Victoria is not a bit worse than the New South Welshman, and the New South Wales manufacturer is no better than the Victorian - their claims would be speedily reduced to something like equitable dimensions, and we should secure a fairly honest and satisfactory Tariff. </para>

                    <para>- I do not intend to detain the House more than a few minutes. I propose to follow what I regard as the very excellent example set by the honorable member for Northern Melbourne. I had intended to go somewhat fully into the history and the relative merits of protection and freetrade, but I feel that at this stage, after all the speeches which have been made, anything of the kind would be out of place. It would be the repetition of very much more than a twice-told tale. But in spite of all that has been said and written on this subject, there seems to be. much misconception, and in quarters, too, where one would least expect to find it. The Tariff introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs has come in for some condemnation, but it should not be forgotten that any Tariff introduced by the leader of the Opposition would have shared the same fate, with possibly this difference - that the outcry would have been more pronounced, because, as honorable members will admit, it is the revenue lines of the present Tariff to which the greatest exception is being taken. The hard fact which cannot be shirked is that the sum of £9,000,000 has to be raised. </para>

                        <para>- Let my honorable and learned friend show me one speech made in 1828 in which the expression " revenue tariffist " was used. He is labouring under a delusion. In the history of the House of Commons there is not one record of the use of the expression " revenue tariffist." It was first used by a slave-master of South Carolina - John C. Calhoun, the great nullifier, and when he became a great free-trader Daniel Webster, of the north, became a protectionist. The factories were shifted to the north, and then by every stream, every little highway, every waterway, a factory village sprang up. So, when the rebellion broke out, the southern people had no artisans. They had the primary producers, what my honorable friends want in Australia to-day. They lind the coloured gentlemen who raised the cotton, but they had no artisans. When the first few battles had been fought, and they found that they required to have factories and mills, they could not get artisans to manufacture anything for them. But every stream in the north, every spindle that turned, every wheel that revolved, was one of the soldiers of the army of the Lord, to put down that rebellion. And yet, having that experience to go by and to guide them are my honorable friends going to have nothing but primary producers in Australia? I have the prof found est reverence for the primary producer. I am a primary producer myself. My honorable friends for whom I have the greatest respect have spoken of the Australian primary producer in wails and lamentations. They have told us of the wrongs we are inflicting on the primary producer. In fact they have demonstrated conclusively that the Australian is unfit for any calling which requires intense application, genius, or talent. I cannot get away from that. I am judging my honorable friends on their own declarations, and I cannot separate the sin from the sinner on this occasion. I want to confine them strictly to this primary production. </para>

The free-traders say that we should throw our industrial pups into the stream, but the great speech made by the honorable and learned member for Indi absolutely squelched them ! His speech was like an avalanche on the eastern peaks of the Rockies. It came down upon honorable members opposite with such crushing force that they have not recovered from it yet. I sympathize with my honorable friends, because they are fighting a losing cause, and it requires more courage to suffer defeat and fight again, than to return to the conflict after victory. </para>

                        <para>- It is foreign so far as the conditions of Australia are concerned. What is good for England is not good for us. A few moments ago, the honorable member for Capricornia said that in New. South Wales they eat so many more pounds of meat a year than they do in Victoria. But meat-eaters never yet thought out anything for the world. In Scotland, where they eat " parritch," they have given the world the best thought it has ever had ; and next to Scotland come the rock-ribbed hills of New England, where the snow lies on the ground for six months at a time. When the Scotchman lives in his own country, and has to think to get his food, he becomes a great thinker and inventor; but when he leaves his country, and makes plenty of boodle, he begins to live on meat, and does not think any more. Therefore, I do not consider the statistics in regard to meat eating worth anything. If people did with half the eating that goes on, it would be better for them. Nowadays, they eat themselves into the gripes. Honorable members all know that it does not require a great amount of ability to be a destructive critic, but it requires a mighty amount of ability to be a constructive philosopher. I remember once seeing a mule in Texas - and everybody knows that a mule is a hybrid, with no pride of ancestry or hope of posterity - kick a crockery shop down in about twenty minutes ; but if you started him to make a cup and saucer he could not do it if he lived 50 years. I have the greatest sympathy for my friends opposite, and I want to tell them the truth. A few years ago I was travelling through the country, and I came to a place where there was an old sign-board pointing to an abandoned, scrub-infested paddock, but the direction of the road had been changed. Thousands of people went along the road and left the sign-board unchanged, and so for 50 years it diligently directed the attention of heedless travellers to the scrub - infested paddock, swearing that the road still led that way. I said to myself when I saw it, " That is the free-trade party of Australia." They do not know that the times have changed, and they never will know, because they have lost their hearing, and have become blind. I remember that on another occasion I came to a place where there had formerly been an hotel and stable, but everything had been burnt down, with the exception of three chimneys, which stood there, monuments of the the terrible disaster that had occurred. But the sign-board at the roadside was untouched, and it said, " Entertainment for man and beast." It kept on saying that, although there had not been a man entertained in the hotel for 40 years past. The birds perched upon that board and sang in the summer time, the wind whistled round it in the winter, but it still stuck to its tale - " Entertainment for man and beast." I said again to myself, " That is the free-trade party of Australia. " I regret that they are living in the past ages. They are children of darkness, but they do not know it. The members of that party in this House are as nice, refined, and cultured gentlemen as I have ever met, and I think highly of them. It is said that on one occasion a darkness overspread Egypt that was so thick that you could feel it, and they had a bottle of that darkness in Rome for 500 years. But if the Egyptian darkness was so thick that you could feel it, the darkness which over spreads my friends opposite is so thick that you could- eat it. In every department of economic research we find men of great intellectual endowments and loud pretensions who get notions, or theories, or some kind of wavy idea that is floating in the air into their heads, which they baptize with the name of science, and, mounting their hobby, they ride it furiously to death. True science is, undoubtedly, something to be proud of. We know that in every country there are people who are always looking for something striking. Our friends opposite believe that in free-trade they have the hope of the philosopher's stone, which will turn the mallee scrub and sage bush into wealth and gold. What a charming and beautiful theory ! The beauty of it lies in this, that it requires no verification. But it is a one-legged truth, and has never yet budged an inch, no i- ever will. All the same it is very captivating, and we see our friends waltzing round it, singing hymns of satisfaction. We see them doing homage to it as to a thing of mystic import. They see their goddess, their Venus, lying dead, and they know that her copper-coloured bosom will never heave with love again, but they refuse to believe it. All over the world their musty covered mummies are still waiting for the commercial resurrection promised by their prophets. But instead of blessing them, they will turn round and curse them. England became a free-trade nation for self-protection and self preservation. She thought that after her 200 years of protection, having lent money to the whole world, and made it her debtor, she was strong enough to proclaim herself a freetrader. The great Adam Smith got a comfortable situation in a Glasgow Custom-house, and he preached free-trade to the world. The doctrine went forth everywhere. But the nations found that a man behind an entrenchment, with cannons and maxims well mounted, can keep 100 or 500 at bay, as the Boers have done during the present war. So one nation after another began to adopt a policy of protection. Honorable members hear a lot about the corn laws of England, but the abolition of the corn laws was another act of self-protection. England preaches freetrade to the world, but believes in protection if she could adopt it. I have the greatest possible regard for my friends opposite. To me, metaphorically speaking, they are the blind bats of fiscalism, sitting on the withered limb of the ring-barked, dying, free-trade tree. Yet, how heroically they exhibit their one legged economic deformity. They stand up and fight nobly for a dying cause. But let me tell them that free-trade was born in the Utopian imagination of the closet, the birthplace of millions of theatrical delusions, many of which die in premature birth, whilst numerous others drive people to destruction. It was then transferred from closet to closet, and there it was elaborated and re-elaborated by the brains of every succeeding theorist without the slightest knowledge of the practical application of these pernicious theories to the common affairs of the world. Like hothouse plants, when exposed to the rude action of the changing seasons, they perish. </para>

                        <para>- I refer to free-trade. My honorable and learned friend may wish to plant it to-night. I never strike the dead hard. My enmity ends at the grave. I wish to say that the pulse of free-trade is feeble now, and if honorable members opposite mean to take advantage of the last hour, let them get upon the stool of repentance. We are going to blow that light out to-night. But not for all this earth would I blow out the faintest light that ever sflickered on the human horizon of despair, or the human horizon of hope.' But I want, however, to take that infamous shadow out of the hearts of honorable members opposite. It has got them bad. Following up the cause of this theory of free-trade and its effect, I shall take another point, and then I shall close. </para>

                        <para>- The other night I cheered my right honorable friend for nearly two hours, and yet he is urging me to sit down. I have only good feeling towards my colleagues from Tasmania - the best of feeling. I regret that there is not a better feeling amongst the people of the whole world. There is too much solemnity, gloom, and sadness upon this earth. We ought to shake hands, and bury all our harsh feelings. </para>

                        <para>- I am prepared to admit that, but what I want to say is, that he has never looked upon it with any great alarm, or supposed that the State is going to be ruined because he requires to issue those Treasury bills. Most of the States have, at some time or another, had to adopt a similar course. One regrettable course I think he has taken, and that is, the selling of land to redeem those Treasury bills. That, I think, is one of the most regrettable courses that any Government could follow, and I hope the wisdom of the people of Queensland will be sufficient to make the Government realize that it is not a wise thing to sell land for that or any other purpose. I repeat that I do not think that Queensland is going to be inconvenienced to an}' great extent by this Tariff, and though some people there may believe that some mild form of disaster may follow from other causes, personally I do not think that any disaster is likely to take place. So far as the Tariff is concerned, I think the Government, in framing their proposals, might have had some more consideration for the various primary industries of the States. I am not going to dilate upon the farming industry, as I leave that to those who are interested. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member need not assume the role of the doubting Thomas. I am prepared to be judged entirely by results. I feel that this debate, interminable as it seems, is not without its good features. I do not believe that a single vote has been gained on either side by the speeches which have been delivered. But a vast amount of education has been afforded the public generally, as well as to some honorable members - myself among the number - by the efforts of those who have made themselves conversant with the effects of the two fiscal expedients, known by the names of free-trade and protection. I feel that every honorable member has been actuated by a desire to do his best for the Commonwealth at the inception of its career. Therefore the remarks I have to make will not, I trust, be regarded as carping criticism, but rather as an indication of the feelings I entertain in respect to these most important matters. At the outset, I wish to state that I had the privilege of hearing the Prime Minister deliver his speech at Maitland. The pledge which he gave then has been fulfilled to the uttermost. I do not concern myself with the twisting and torturings to which his words have been subjected. I have regard only to the impression which the speech conveyed to me, as one of the vast audience present on that occasion, and I say honestly that, in my opinion, the Tariff brought down by the Government fulfils exactly the promise then made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government. Whether the Tariff will suit the several States or not is a matter which the members representing those States must determine. They must be regarded as the best judges. So far as Victoria is concerned, I feel that if there are any shortcomings in the performance which the speech promised, they are in the direction of a failure to carry out altogether the promise of protection to industries already established. In his Maitland speech, the Prime Minister made clear the attitude which he intended to adopt with respect to revenue. He told us that revenue would be a primary consideration. He promised the people of Australia that, in obtaining that revenue, there would be no disastrous interference on the part of the Government with any industry which had been established, and that at the same time opportunities would be given for the establishment of other industries within the Commonwealth. If there is to be any doubt at all in regard to the fulfilment of the promise then made, it will be in the direction I. have indicated. I have studied the Tariff carefully. As a member of the State Parliament of Victoria I had experience of Tariff revision in 1895. In their wildest moments those who then called themselves Tariff reformers could not have anticipated such marked reductions upon the Victorian Tariff as those now proposed by the Federal Government. I make that statement from my own personal experience. I was one of those who considered at the time that as Victoria was a State with artificial boundaries erected against other States on the same continent, inhabited by people speaking the same language and living under the same system of government, the duties which we were imposing were too high. </para>

Honorable members opposite say that if you take from a man ten shillings in the pound, by revenue duties, that is taxation, but if you take the whole pound under protective duties, it is not. On the same reasoning if a highwayman took from a person who had two sovereigns in his pocket one of his coins, it would be robbery, but if he took both, it would not. </para>

                        <para>- No. The honorable member for Mernda was not in Sydney at the time. The gentleman to whom I refer went further, and said that, whilst he was a free-trader in principle, and would vote accordingly - because I reminded him of his former statements - if the people of Australia were so foolish as to vote money into his pockets, he was not going to be so foolish as to take it out again. In other words, whilst he would act according to his principles, he would be only too glad to receive the money which a protective Tariff would place in his pocket. I said to him - "Although you may make this sum of money by reason of the imposition of protective duties, surely in the course of two or three years the demand will be so limited that you will not get on as well as you otherwise would. If the consumption of a large quantity of these goods ceases - as it undoubtedly will - you will be worse off." "Not in our case," he replied. "We happen to be a wealthy firm. We shall be able to put down all the money required to be paid for the goods when they arrive here, and we shall be in a position to collect from the people not only that amount, but interest upon it. Further, such a duty will wipe out the small men who are cutting into our profits - men who can send a £50 note home and indent goods out. It will do away with a large number of our competitors, and then we shall be better able to form a ring, because the larger the amount of capital required to go into this business, the smaller will be the number of men who can embark upon it. We shall thus be able to combine more easily. That, however, is impossible under the present fiscal system, and therefore your arguments cease to have any weight with me. The most you can expect from me is that I shall adhere to my principles. Whilst I shall vote for the adoption of a free-trade policy, I shall not lift my finger or contribute one penny towards preventing the imposition of these duties. I am quite willing to be called a bloated importer or anything else. If the people will insist upon imposing these duties, I am perfectly willing to allow them to put £10,000 or £12,000 into my pocket." I ask leave to continue my remarks to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has pointed out that only now have they been able to succeed in raising the condition of the workers to that of a living wage, and that outside the factories which have not the minimum wage, and which are not regulated by law, the condition of the workers is very deplorable indeed. He has shown that times out of number. If he had gone further, he could have used this argument - "It is perfectly true that protection has produced this result. It is only meant for the manufacturer, and, naturally, he is not going to look after the interests of any worker. What does any man mean by not having sufficient money to enable him to pay all these duties ? A man like that is not to be considered for a moment. It shows that he will not work." Or perhaps the honorable member went on the argument that because a man is poor he must have had an opportunity of saving money, and, therefore, ought to be well off, and that because he makes no display of wealth, he must be saving it. Sometimes the reason why a man is not saving wealth is because he does not make it. If the honorable member had ever asked himself how many men can be employed in the greatest manufacturing industry in any country in sound work, he would have found that in protected industries not more than one man in ten can be so employed, and that if a duty is needed, in order to keep the tenth man going, the nine others must be taxed. In Victoria not so many as one in every ten are employed in factories. I do not think it has been right to quibble at the comparisons which have been made between New South Wales .and Victoria, because they are two States which, though side by side, have adopted diametrically opposite principles. In New South Wales they have gone on the principle that the less you tax the people the better it is for them, and chat the less you interfere with them the more likely are they to find out what is to their interest to do, and act accordingly. But in Victoria they have proceeded on quite the other principle. It is said that Parliament can far better regulate the affairs of the people and teach them how to trade than they can themselves. Before we consent to apply that principle to individuals, ought we not to be quite ready to consent, each of us, to hand over the management of his own affairs to the other 74 members of the House ? I venture to say that there is not one honorable member who would hand over the control of his business to the other 74. But although honorable members decline to allow their fellow members to take control of their business, they say - " We are willing to pass a law which will allow them to control and regulate the business of other men whom we do not know." Although the honorable member for Echuca will not allow the rest of us to take control of his own business, because, in his opinion, we are not competent to undertake its management, he says - " We should pass a law to regulate the trade of other people, and teach them what lines to go into, although we know nothing about them. We should get reports from a few men who are interested in seeing that the money of other people goes into their own pockets. We should consider them because they can come here and make their representations to us." </para>

                        <para>- That being ' so the Treasurer cannot complain if I interpret his answer in my own way. Among the very fine phrases used by the Prime Minister in his speech at Maitland, was that there would be no " wanton destruction of industries." But if the right honorable gentleman had meant what he said, he would never have proposed to put a duty on the raw material of the vehicle-makers of New South Wales. The total value of the vehicles imported into New South Wales last year, including two State carnages, was only £13,000; whereas the value of the raw material imported was about £100,000. The profit on the £13,000 could not have amounted to more than £2,000, supposing the vehicles had been made in the State. No doubt the right honorable gentleman contends, as a protectionist, that similar vehicles will be prevented from coming in now, and that will be so to a certain extent. But there is to be collected on the raw material of this industry no less a sum than £22,500. There are 1,570 men engaged in the industry, and before they can be placed in the same position they were in before the imposition of the Tariff, they will have to make an extra profit of over £20,000. The right honorable the Prime Minister has behaved so badly that there is not to be found in New South Wales any one who would place the slightest reliance on his word. He has done more to bring discredit on politics than any other man has ever done, and in the future it will doubtless be said of others who behave in a similar fashion - " Oh, do not believe them, they are only Bartonising." </para>

                        <para>- It is a great pity the Prime Minister did not make it more clear to the people of New South Wales that they were expected to make all the sacrifices, and that the other States were not expected to make any sacrifices at all. If a low Tariff would conduce to more rigid economy on the part of the States Governments, I should hail with joy as low a Tariff as could possibly be framed. I admit there is difficulty in the way of the Federal Government imposing direct taxation, because we must leave some means open to the States of obtaining revenue by direct taxation.

The Government unduly hampered the finances by taking over the Postal and </para>

They have a right to know into whose pockets the money which is taken from them goes, and honorable members on the Government side have no right to be annoyed when questions are asked on the subject. If honorable members pursue a certain course, and try to benefit certain individuals at the cost of the general public, they ought to be prepared to listen to the truth. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so. If the honorable member can show that those duties will inflict hardship without conferring a sufficient benefit upon the community, I am quite prepared to vote with him to strike them out. I repeat that the purely protective duties are, in my opinion, fairly satisfactory. I know that some industries have sustained a severe blow even -in South Australia, where the duties which formerly operated were not very high. For example, since the day after the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced this Tariff, not a single man has been employed in the cigar-making industry there owing to the reduction in the differential duties. I have heard the importers' statements, and I have also secured very full details from persons in the trade, who traverse the arguments of the importers, and show that they are entirely biased and one-sided. There were five or six factories in Adelaide prior to the introduction of the Tariff, and every man who was employed therein has been thrown out of work. </para>

In South Australia they can be manufactured as cheaply as they can be elsewhere. The cost of the raw material is not greater there, and the conditions under which the men work are about the same as those which obtain elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- They have not been shut down because the difference between the duties which formerly operated in those States and the duties imposed under the present Tariff is not so great. Victoria is the only State in which the cigar making industry has attained to any proportions. There are not many cigars made in Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but very few. In Victoria a considerable number of cigars are manufactured, and South Australia has also turned out a fair quantity relatively to her population. In Victoria the industry has sustained the same blow as that which it has experienced in South Australia, though not quite to the same extent. Nevertheless, the cigar-makers here have informed some honorable members that they will not be able to continue the industry under the changed conditions. I refer to this matter only as one instance in which this Tariff has led to the destruction of an industry which formerly employed a considerable number of men, and enabled them to provide for their families. Whilst it is a small industry, I cannot, with indifference, contemplate its destruction. </para>

                            <para>- It is the difference between the cost of production here and the import duty which is the protection to the local manufacturers and workers, but if the duties on the raw materials are raised, that has the same effect as the abolition of the protection. Unquestionably, the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer are to be congratulated on the fact that on the whole there has been so little outcry from the various industries which, except in New South Wales, have hitherto been protected in various ways in the different States. The whole outcry against this Tariff has been in connexion with the revenue items; Except in the case of the cigar-makers, the white workers, and one or two other classes, I have heard no complaints to speak of, the whole outcry having arisen in connexion with the increased cost of the necessaries of life, as they are called, such as timber, kerosene, tea, preserved milk, flannelette, and cotton goods. Honorable members who talk about the incidence of this Tariff being oppressive on the poorer people, state what is true, because in my opinion the revenue duties, though not the protective duties, are decidedly oppressive in many respects. The reason, of course, is that the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer deem it necessary to raise the immense sum of nearly £9,000,000 in order to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth. It is not necessary, in my opinion, to inflict a £9,000,000 Tariff on the people. I do not feel inclined to add to the burdens of the people by taxing those articles which are in common consumption, and which cannot be made in the Commonwealth, though these are the articles which members of the Opposition regard as affording the only proper means of raising revenue by Customs duties. </para>

                            <para>- That is a fact which is often overlooked. It is said that when articles are prevented from coming into the Commonwealth there is a tremendous loss of revenue. But if articles are presented from coming in, it is because they are made by people who live here, and who maintain their families by their earnings, while, at the same time, they are consuming other dutiable goods, and thus paying revenue to the country. A great deal more is made of the arguments about loss of revenue than the. case warrants. </para>

                            <para>- If such duties are imposed that no goods come in, that, in the absence of competition, certainly leads to the establishment of manufacturers' rings. But if there be free-trade and no local competition, that leads to the formation of importers' rings ; and one set of rings is as bad as the other. </para>

                        <para>- At this late period of the debate, and early hour of the morning, I should not have troubled the House had it not been that in certain quarters a doubt has been expressed as to how I shall record my vote in connexion with the motion of censure proposed by the leader of the Opposition. I rise more for the purpose of removing that doubt than for any other reason. Why such a doubt should have been expressed I know not. At the election I stood as a supporter of the Barton Government. I was opposed by one of the high priests of the free-trade democratic league, which did all it possibly could to secure my defeat. A section of the press that has devoted a considerable amount of attention to me during the last three or four weeks, on that occasion placarded its columns with my name as a high Tariff candidate. Yet within the last week or two they have stated that I should be false to my pledges if I voted with the Government on this occasion. In support of what I now state, I may add that some little time before the day of nomination there were three candidates for the Wimmera seat in the field in the interests of the Barton Government. I thought it was inadvisable for the three of us to stand, and brought about a conference, the result of which was that an arbitration committee was formed. One member of that committee was the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and I was chosen as their candidate. That, I think, proves that knowing the policy of the Government I was their candidate, and I have broken no election pledge. I desire to draw attention to a quotation from the first speech I delivered in connexion with that election. The speech was circulated throughout the length and breadth of the Wimmera, and every elector in that district got a copy of it. I am reported to have said in that speech - </para>

                            <para>- I purchased one myself some three years ago, and paid £55 for it. Some four or five weeks ago, however, I bought a machine of the same make for £30. The cause of the reduction is that the ring which existed amongst the importers here has been broken up. The reapers and binders for which we had to pay £55 a year or two ago can now be obtained in Victoria at prices ranging from £27 to £35. The leader of the Opposition forgot to mention the price of the reaper and binder in New South Wales. A machine of exactly the same make as that for which I paid £30 in Victoria cannot be bought in New South Wales to-day for less than £48. </para>

I particularly inquired the other day whether the price of tea, in ordinary use amongst farmers, has been increased.

                            <para>- Principally. I have stated that I have pledged myself to the retention of the farmers' free list. In committee I shall endeavour, in accordance with my pledges from the platform, to have put on the free list corrugated iron, traction engines, trough iron, lubricating mineral oils, kerosene, and sewing twine. I shall also endeavour to have put on the free list, iron .tanks, which are very largely used by the farmers in the dry districts. I desire to get a reduction made in the duty on reaper and binder twine. The two factories in Victoria do not confine their operations solely to the manufacture of reaper and binder twine. They also manufacture l'ope, mats, and many other articles ; and even if their industry be interfered with to a slight extent, it is only right that producers should get the benefit of a reduced duty. I am quite aware that the reduction of the duties on these articles will diminish the estimated revenue to a considerable extent. The estimated duty on corrugated iron is £13,800 ; on iron tanks, £7,560 ; on kerosene, £157,500 ; and on reaper and binder twine, nil. I would also support the reduction of the duty on salt by 10s. per ton; this will mean £9,800. I would also support a reduction by one-fourth of the proposed duty . on soft-wood timber ; this would amount to £29,795. If the whole of the estimated revenue is required, it is only fair when we suggest a reduction of the duties on certain articles to indicate how the deficiency could be made up. My idea of how it should be made up is that there should be an increase of ls. per gallon on spirits, which would provide £1.23,477 ; an increase of 5 per cent, on jewellery and imitation jewellery, which would produce £7,375 ; an increase of 5 per cent, on watches and clocks, which would provide £9,220 ; and an increase of 5 per cent. on bicycles, which would yield £14,100. Under any circumstances I would support an increase of the duty on bicycles. As a representative of the producers, I think that bicycles come into unfair competition with farmers who breed horses and grow horse feed; therefore I would tax them as much as I could. I would raise the duty on silk in the piece from 15 to 25 per cent., which would provide £63,146. The increases I advocate would amount to £223,458, and the reductions to £218,455, so that the one would pretty well balance the other. There are many other anomalies in the Tariff. I strongly object to the composite duties. I do not know where this method came from. It is entirely new to all Australian Tariffs, and the objection is that it is misleading as it hides the real amount of the duty which has to be paid. All commercial and business men strongly object to composite duties, and in committee I shall vote for their alteration, because it is only fair that we should know exactly the amount of duty which we are called upon to pay. Another matter I wish to mention is the mode in which the Government are collecting their duties. It appears that they are charging duty on the cost of carriage from the factory to the port of export, and on the package itself. This is quite new to Victorians, and I certainly think that some explanation should be made by the Government in justification of their action. I have here the bill of lading of a small shipment of axe handles which has arrived from America since the imposition of the Federal Tariff, and I think it speaks for itself. It was handed to me by a merchant within the last day or two, and the particulars are as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister cannot urge that I have been responsible for keeping the House late. I have sat through the debate of the past fortnight without contributing to its prolongation up to the present moment. Many honorable members have spoken, as indeed they had a perfect right to do on a matter of such vast importance. But the Government ought to have some little consideration for honorable members who have sat here so patiently for two or three weeks past. I do not think it is too much, at this hour of the morning, to ask for a short adjournment, so as to enable us to deal fairly and honestly with this question. I fully recognise that the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs had a unique task to perform in the preparation of this Tariff. They have had to deal with the diverse interests of the different States, and to endeavour to bring about uniformity by means of an acceptable piece of legislation. This was a gigantic task, no matter by whom it was undertaken, and I and others are prepared to sympathize with the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs. We are now dealing with Tariff proposals from a national stand-point but there is no doubt that in our discussions we have been tempted to look at the Government proposals from the stand-point of the States. That was to be expected, because we have not yet obtained that more complete and wider knowledge which will be ours by-and-by. The discussion has had a considerable colouring of State politics, and I must confess that I- shall be compelled to look at the question very largely from the stand-point of my own State of New South Wales. I have been reminded that I had something to say on the fiscal question when the address in reply was before the House. If I remember rightly, I, on that occasion, indicated that I considered the issue which would be presented to us was much complicated by what are known as the Braddon or bookkeeping provisions in the Constitution. The Tariff proposals now submitted to us confirm the view that there would be the difficulties which I and others foresaw on that occasion. A great deal of the trouble that the Government now have in placing these Tariff proposals before the honorable members and the country arises from the provisions in the Constitution to which I have referred. During the discussions which took place on the question of the acceptance or rejection of a Constitution, and also in the brief remarks I made on the address in reply, I stated that I believed the Braddon sections introduced a bad and unsound principle into our Commonwealth finances. Whatever Government undertook the duty of formulating the first Tariff - -it does not matter from which side that Government was formed - was bound by the Constitution to assist in financing the States. By the taking over of the Customs and Excise, the different States lose a certain amount of revenue, and the alternative is either that of economizing the expenditure of the States and making good the deficiency by means of other forms of direct taxation, or placing upon the Federal Government the obligation of providing the States Governments with the necessary means. Undoubtedly, the effect of the sections in the Constitution to which I have referred is to compel the Commonwealth Treasurer to become the taxgatherer for the States, and I hold that to be a vicious principle to introduce into the functions of government. Our great safeguard in connexion with taxation lies in the method to which, under self-government, we have hitherto been accustomed. The safeguard is that the Government which incurs expenditure and gives rise to the need for increased taxation, has to go to the taxpayers direct for approval that expenditure. If the taxpayers are not satisfied that the money has been properly expended, they have it within their power to punish the responsible politicians. Now, however, we have introduced a foreign principle, which imposes on the Federal Treasurer and the Federal Parliament the obligation of raising taxation for State purposes. The Federal Treasurer has not the determination of the expenditure, that being a matter entirely for the State Treasurers, so that we do not now have the advantage of the responsibility which has hitherto obtained. These provisions of the Constitution will, I believe, lead to financial complications which cannot be fully realized at the present time. It is a pity that these provisions ever found a place in the Constitution, and the sooner they are eliminated the better it will be for pure, honest, safe government, both federal and State. On the other hand, while the Constitution imposes on the Federal Treasurer and on this Parliament the obligation to raise through the Customs 20s. for every 5s. required for federal purposes, and of returning 15s. back to the States, there is no obligation to make it a primary principle of government that the Commonwealth shall finance the States by that means. The obligation that has been imposed upon this Parliament, and upon the Commonwealth Treasurer, is to finance the Federation, plus the extra amount that the Braddon clause requires. But this Government, instead of adopting this sound policy, and thereby gradually teaching the States to become self-reliant and to make good the amount they have lost by the transference of their right to tax through customs and excise - instead of leading them to get upon a sound financial basis, and so prepare the way for the time when the people of Australia can legislatively eliminate the Braddon blot from the Constitution - have taken the other course of making it the first principle of their Tariff proposals to tax for State purposes and to finance the States. </para>

                            <para>- The Federal Treasurer has the reputation of having had a very close fist while he was in charge of the finances of the State which he served so faithfully and well before he became the servant of the Federation. He earned and deserved the reputation for getting for the people of Victoria 20s. in value for every £1 of expenditure. The Federation might reasonably expect the same kind of safe and economical expenditure at his hands. That being so, I think - and I believe it can be conclusively proven - that the Commonwealth can be financed for very much less than the Government require in the basis they have adopted. </para>

                            <para>- It will mean that the State Treasurers, instead of adopting the policy of extravagance which they seem to have adopted at the present time, will be called upon to make good this deficiency, which will not be very great. They will be compelled to exercise economy in expenditure, and to devise other means of obtaining revenue. Thus they will be forced to act upon a sound basis. If that is not to be done the Federal Parliament is to be made the taxgatherer for the States, and is to act as such, practically financing them for the next ten years. It will thus be made harder to get back upon sound financial lines than if they are compelled to start on those lines now. That is my contention and my reply to the honorable member for Corinella. </para>

                            <para>- We have taken away a part of their previous means of financing in consequence of the consummation' of federation, but the States still have large powers of taxation which they can exercise. My opposition to the Commonwealth Bill - an opposition that was consistently carried right through the different referendums - was largely based upon the financial weakness that I saw in the Constitution, as well as upon the undemocratic methods adopted for bringing about alterations of the Constitution, and allowing the people to adjust the Constitution to their own requirements. I placed those issues clearly before my electors, making no secret of my opposition. I believe that had others who are now singing out about the system been as faithful to their trust to the people as I and a few others were, the Constitution would have been rid of those blots that are found in it to-day. My complaint against the Government is that they have adopted this wrong basis. They are intensifying and perpetuating the evil by constituting themselves taxgatherers for the States, and making the States dependent upon the Commonwealth for their ways and means of finance in years to come. I simply wish to indicate the foundation principles upon which I took exception to the methods of taxation adopted by the Government in the formulation of their Tariff proposals. I thoroughly believe that the functions of government are to bring about the best social and moral conditions for the community. I do not believe that the Government is constituted merely to collect taxes, to expend money on public works, and to maintain law and order in a community. I believe that where the functions of government can be used to make the condition of the people better and more humane, and to elevate the community, they should be so used. I know that in the great political struggles that have taken place, and are taking place to-day, there is a difference of opinion as to the extent to which governmental interference should be carried, and as to the extent to which it is possible for the functions of government to assist in improving social conditions. Whilst I recognise that the welfare and prosperity of the community are largely affected by questions of taxation and methods of government, I believe that the powers of government can be advantageously used in other directions, and that if they are not used in the direction of bringing about better social conditions, the Government are responsible for the unsatisfactory conditions which remain. I consider that the fact that we have in the community an increasing wealthy few on the one hand, whilst on the other hand we have those who toil from daylight to dark under conditions that are as hard as it is possible for conditions to be, is the outcome of bad legislation in the past, and. of the operation of our form of government. Where we find that the legislation passed has failed to bring about, proper social, conditions it is our duty, if we are loyal to our humanity, to remedy its defects. This is where I differ to some extent from some of my protectionist friends and from some of my free-trade friends. My protectionist friends seem to think that we shall have reached the millennium if we get an ideal form of protection ; and some free-traders think that all that is desired is an ideal form of free-trade, and that then everything will be just as it ought to be. I do not believe that. I believe there are other matters we shall have to deal with in our legislation and in our administration of the government with which we are charged, and that we must deal with them upon proper lines before we can bring about the improved social conditions we aim at. I have to make my choice as to which of two systems will be most conducive to the reforms in the direction I consider legislation should take in order to attain that ideal - whether a system of freedom of commerce or trade, or a system of restricted commerce and restricted tirade. I have no hesitation in arriving at a decision, and as the outcome of the best intelligence I can bring to bear upon the question my decision is that while I will not say that advancement or good -social legislation is not possible under a system of protection, I do say that the experience of the past is that protection is the mother of monopoly, and that monopoly is responsible for the existing unsatisfactory social conditions. On the other hand, a system of freedom of commerce assists in bringing about reforms, and placing them on a sound basis, and that is why I favour that system. Any one who has supported any line of reform, will know by experience that he has to meet the opposition of those whose interests are against reform. Adam Smith says that- </para>

                            <para>- That shows to my mind that the Treasurer has not been able to attain the ideal which he set before him of financing the States. That is not his fault. It is the fault of the conditions under which he is called upon to make this effort. If he could have taxed the imports up to the point that would avoid a loss in the case of any of the States, undoubtedly he would have done so ; but every one knows that only a certain amount of revenue can be raised upon a given volume of imports. After the maximum taxable amount has been reached, the revenue derived diminishes with any increased incidence of taxation. I have not the least doubt that the £9,000,000 which the Treasurer proposes to raise is the maximum amount which it is possible to obtain in this way. In order to fulfil his ideal of how the federal and State finances should be managed, the Treasurer would have to raise not £9,000,000 but about £19,000,000 to provide for Western Australia's requirements. According to his Budget papers it would require a revenue of £10,000,000 in order to meet the requirements of Tasmania, £11,000,000 in the case of Queensland, £7,000,000 for Victoria, £6,000,000 for South Australia, and £4,000,000 for New South Wales. Under a £4,000,000 Tariff New South Wales would require to raise from customs and excise only £1,785,781, instead of the amount that she is called upon to raise on the £9,000,000 basis. If a £19,000,000 revenue were adopted she would be required to raise £7,000,000, and that, of course, would be utterly impossible. That is the position, and I think it is to be regretted that the Treasurer did not stop at the point at which the volume of his imports limits him, or even at a lower point. </para>

                            <para>- I think the Treasurer has made the Tariff very much higher than the requirements of the Constitution demand, and I want to reduce it to that point at which it will fit in with the demands of the Constitution. We are told that this is a composite Tariff. It is neither a free-trade nor a protectionist one, but a mixture. We understood all these financial difficulties when we entered into federation. We understood them when we entered upon our first federal elections, but we were given to understand that the Tariff proposals would be of a reasonable character. That they would not run into extreme protection, nor could it be of that free-trade description which would have been possible had not those provisions obtained. I remember that, at the time when parties were being formed, the leader of the Government delivered an address at Bathurst which, whether he so intended it or not, certainly the press and the people took as an indication of the political lines which he proposed to adopt in the impending campaign, and the keynote then sounded to the electors was not to vote on the question of protection or freetrade, but to make the one cardinal principle of the elections the defence of the Constitution. What they were to defend it against was not made very clear, but apparently what was aimed at was that not a man who dared to oppose this model onstitution, who dared to think that it contained a Braddon blot, or any unworkable bookkeeping provisions, should find a place on the floor of the first Federal Parliament. The Prime Minister, in formulating his policy, had to deal with taxation proposals, and I find that at Maitland, where he issued his manifesto, he said - </para>

                    <para>In the course of his address, according to the press, that Minister very freely admitted to the public that the Federation could be financed in accordance with the Constitution upon a Tariff of from 10 to 15 per cent., and it was generally thought that he voiced the intentions of the Government. It was further considered that the freetrade leader could not bring in a Tariff which would be very much lower than than. And this point was very often raised - where was the line of demarcation between the two parties led by these two worthy political warriors. But it was contended by the free-traders that the Tariff introduced by this Government would, in addition to being a revenue Tariff, have a strong protectionist complexion, and that to that extent it would be distinguished from a Tariff designed for purely revenue purposes. We now have the Tariff. In the course of this debate it has not been denied that as far as it was possible for this Government to do so, consistently with getting the amount of revenue they aimed at raising for the purposes they have taken in hand, they made the Tariff as protectionist as it is possible for a Tariff to be made. </para>

Under all forms of Customs taxation the poor man is made the working bullock, and if it were intended to convey that this was a poor man's Tariff in that sense, then I say that it was very properly described. It would be hard to devise a Tariff that would more completely place the burden of taxation upon those least able to bear it. The Attorney-General of New South Wales says - </para>

                            <para>- No, they were not Chinese. There are more Chinese doing laundry work in protectionist Melbourne than there are in free-trade Sydney. This was not a gathering of Chinese, but of people who have the same coloured skin as the honorable member who has interjected. They are engaged in a very arduous class of work which is not too well remunerated. The laundry association of New South Wales convened this meeting for the purpose of considering how its members were affected by this " poor man's " Tariff. After discussing the matter, the following resolution was passed : - </para>

                        <para>We, the members of the laundry trade in meeting assembled, view with surprise and indignation the excessive duties (nearly 190 per cent, in some instances) about to be levied on laundry supplies, which represent the raw materials used in the laundry trade. Whilst strongly protesting against such prohibitory duties, we cannot too highly condemn the cunning and shameful act of putting on the free list articles that are well-known to be extensively adulterated in the locally-manufactured laundry supplies. </para>

                        <para>Although my district has been looked upon as protectionist, there is a very strong feeling against the duties which the farmers will De called upon to bear under the present Tariff. When on the public platform, in connexion with the Federal Constitution referendum, I stated that an Australian Tariff, which imposed heavy duties upon the producers, would at once convert this class of the community into free-traders. This prophecy is already coming true. Farmers who have been consistent protectionists in my district are beginning to have strong leanings towards free-trade. The protection which has been afforded the farmer under the Tariff is only in name. </para>

                        <para>On the whole, the country people complain about the Tariff. The duty on timber affects them particularly. On butter-boxes alone it will mean a charge of ?300 per year in a factory whose weekly output is from 15 to 20 tons. These factories are owned by the producers themselves. Galvanized iron is another item which the country people use largely. Kerosene, too, is much used in engines for driving separators and chaffcutters, because hitherto it has been more economical. There have been many complaints from miners that almost everything used by them is taxed. The necessaries of the poor have been hit heavily. Luxuries should have been taxed more freely before the articles used by the working classes were trenched upon. The duties on reapers and binders and reaper and binder twine are another great tax on the producers. </para>

                        <para>He could not help referring to the great burden that it was proposed to place upon the people of this State as part of the whole of Australia. Without going for one moment into the question of free-trade or protection, he would say that the attempt to obtain the enormous sum of ?9,000,000 through the customs and excise duties from a population of three and a half millions was a task never before undertaken in any country. It would impose a burden too great even for this prosperous country. Though average incomes might be larger, the taxable power of a new country in which so much had to be spent upon reproductive agencies was even less than that of older countries. The imposition of this huge burden of taxation could only be done by crushing down the vitality of the producing energies of the country. </para>

                            <para>- It will keep the poor man poor the whole of his days. That is not the kind of Tariff that I want. I do not believe that it is possible to tax a poor man into prosperity. It has never been done in any country. It is true that it is possible to tax a few into prosperity, but always at the expense and to the detriment of the many. That is how millionaires are made. It is because I have a great sympathy for the poor man and come from his ranks that I do not believe in this kind of taxation. In the course of the discussion many arguments have been advanced in support of the principle and theory of protection. I should like to deal briefly with two or three matters which suggest themselves to me at the present moment. I find that one of the claims put forward on behalf of protection is its hoariness. Protection, we are told, has dominated the world for so long and to such an extent, and the free-trade principle is of such recent date, that those who espouse protectionist views consider that upon this ground they have substantial justification for their faith. Many other doctrines could be sustained on the same ground. Whilst this argument was being put forward one honorable member interjected that the religion of Buddha could be sustained on similar grounds. A principle does not win my approval solely on the ground that it happens to be old, and to have dominated a large section of humanity.. If it does not appeal to my reason as. substantial and sound, I do not adopt it merely because it is accepted by a majority. I admit this claim of age for protection, but I contend that it has dominated the world and has been so general because the world has. been ruled by the few, and the many have never yet had a complete say in its government. When the many become sufficiently educated to take the power of governing themselves into their own hands, they will begin to see that this method of running the government is not as fair as many people would have us believe, and the simple method of securing the acceptance of a Tariff merely on the dictum that it is a poor man's Tariff, though it presses heavily upon him, will no longer obtain. With the advance of education and science, which are deadly enemies of the narrow restricted spirit that underlies protectionist ideas, protection will gradually disappear. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports laughs at that. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member does not know what trades unionism is. When the House met first, the honorable member interjected from the opposite corner that he could not understand how a man could be a free-trader and a representative of labour. In this debate the honorable member followed the honorable member for West Sydney, as true a labour representative as ever stood upon the floor of a legislative chamber, and as able a man as the labour ranks of New South Wales have produced ; and though on the first occasion he doubted how a man could espouse democratic legislation in the labour interest, and claim to be a trades unionist and a free-trader, on this occasion he claimed for himself the same disinterested sincerity that he was prepared to concede to his fellow member. Seeing that in so short a time the education of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports proceeded so far, I have yet hope that he will learn what trades unionism really means, and that it does not necessarily mean the placing of burdens upon the shoulders of trades unionists. Before I leave the argument, that because of the antiquity of the protectionist theory and doctrines, and the extent to which they have dominated the world, the Federal Parliament cannot go very far wrong in accepting this form of taxation as a policy for the Commonwealth, I would like to remind honorable members of the comparisons which have been suggested between England and America. The honorable member for Gippsland seems to think that because England is importing a groat deal of the wealth of the world she must very quickly go into the Bankruptcy Court. 19 s 2 </para>

                            <para>- Adam Smith admitted the existence of the wage fund theory. Later inquiries and research by equally competent economic writers and thinkers have disproved the wage fund theory in its generally accepted sense. One of the modern writers upon this question, Professor F. A. Walker - an American - in his work entitled " The Wages Question," deals with the matter in Chapter VIII. in this way - </para>

                        <para>The popular theory of wages is based upon the assumption that wages are paid out of capital, the saved results of the industry of the past. Hence it is argued capital must furnish the measure of wages. On the contrary, I hold that wages are, in a philosophical View of the subject, paid out of the product of present industry, and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages. . . . The employer purchases labour with a view to the product of labour, and the kind and amount of that product determine what wages he can afford to pay. </para>

                            <para>- There is no freedom of contract or competition about that. Competition comes in where, by legislation and Governmental enactment, we shut out the great mass of humanity from their natural opportunities, and give the right to a few individuals to say whether or not a man shall live on God's earth. In that way we set him in competition with his fellow man. In that way we create the wage fund and the iron law of wages, which is not a natural economic fact, but the outcome of our unnatural social and legislative conditions. There is another theory, that the imposition of customs duties is necessary, in order to keep money in the country. I think the Treasurer used that expression in the course of his speech. It is a most extraordinary thing that, notwithstanding the taxation, imposed by countries which have, adopted the principle avowedly for that purpose, they do not succeed in retaining the money within their boundaries. I find that this principle does not work out in America, as those who espouse the protectionist policy for that purpose would lead us to believe. Whilst there was a low Tariff in America the exports of money were less than under the high Tariff which obtains there. Victoria has produced as much gold as any other place in the world of corresponding size. Its total "gold production amounts to about £250,000,000. </para>

South Australia also lost to the extent of 1,933. The remaining colonies all gained slightly.

In1889 there was a general failure in New South Wales and Victoria. In 1890 the crop failed in Victoria, and in the following year that colony, for the first time in 22 years, was compelled to import wheat.

                    <para>Mr.BROWN. - It must be remembered that the New South Wales farmer has had to compete with an open market and with the Victorian farmer, though he was not on' the same footing with him to the extent to which the Victorian farmer was protected. Still, despite that disadvantage, with the other advantages he possesses he has been able to make headway, and the returns I have quoted indicate the relative positions in which the farmers of the two States stand to day. Two or three speakers have discussed the price paid for reapers and binders, and it has been stated that, because of protection, the farmer in Victoria can obtain a reaper and binder much cheaper than can the farmer in New South Wales, who, it is said, is under the iron heel of an importers' ring, from which the Victorian farmer is able to escape. I know a little about this particular matter, as I can claim to be one of those who have taken a leading part in the farmers' movement in New South Wales. I can claim to be one of those who assisted in the formation of the' valuable representative organization known as the Farmers and Settlers' Association of New South Wales. Among the delegates to our conference about four years ago was one who had visited America, and who, being of an inquiring turn of mind, had made exhaustive inquiries into the conditions under which farming was carried on there. He discovered that these machines for which we were paying from £55 to £65 each could be purchased in America at prices ranging between£18 and £26. We were told that the importers were responsible for the difference, and we believed that statement. Eventually we decided to do our own work. We formed a Settlers' Co-operative Association, and such a body, worked on sound financial lines, can do more for the farmers than any protective policy could do. We resolved to import the reapers and binders for ourselves, and communicated with a firm doing a large trade in Australia with a popular make of machine. We discovered that it could not be obtained at the reduced price because of the existence of a combination, but we were advised that another machine, built for the South American fields, and differing only slightly from that to which we were accustomed, was not within this combination, and could be landed here at a price more in accord with the cost of production in America. When we entered into negotiations for its purchase, however, we were informed by the representative of the manufacturer's agent in Australia that the undertaking which he had made with us was not approved by the American and Canadian manufacturers. They had formed a ring to control the Australian trade, and had an understanding among themselves that they would not sell under a certain price. Our efforts were thus defeated for the time being. As the result of further negotiations, we got in touch with a manufacturing firm in America which was outside that ring, and obtained from it a number of machines. We were able to sell them at a profit of £35 each, as against the ±'55 and ±'65 which we had been paying previously. The Minister for Trade arid Customs had something to say about wheat-growing in South Australia, and he may be interested to learn that we came to the assistance of farmers there by selling them a number of our machines. As soon as we introduced them, the syndicate in New South Wales considerably reduced its prices. A much larger reduction was made in Victoria, but that was due to the fact that the agents here got at loggerheads. . As soon as the parties come to terms, however, we may be sure that the prices will rise. This fact serves to show that the high prices, instead of being the work of the importers, have been due primarily to the manufacturers' combination. They refused to deal with us when we were prepared to do business with them direct. This incident shows also that the farmers and settlers, under a sound system of co-operation, can do more for themselves than under any protectionist system that could be devised.

                            <para>- I agree with the right honorable gentleman who interrupted me before I had completed my sentence. I was bred and born in the back parts of New South Wales when pioneer conditions prevailed. I had to bear the burdens of the pioneer, and shared none of the advantages of those who live in the city. I have had to work hard to cut out a home in the forest of Australia, and I had to commence work at a time when most young people are pursuing their educational Studies. Despite that fact, the electors out there, believing in my sincerity of purpose, and in my desire to advance the democracy of this country, have placed me in the high and honorable position that I hold as a Member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Whilst I occupy a seat in this House I do not want to do anything that would be to the detriment of the democracy that I represent, or to the working people from whom I come. It is because I view the matter earnestly and seriously in that light that I intend to vote against the Government proposals. I do not claim a monopoly of experience or of brains, nor do I wish to insinuate anything against my fellow countrymen. I give honorable members on the Government side of the House the credit that I take for the Opposition ; but. viewing the issue from the stand-point which I have endeavoured to put forward, I should regret the fact all my life if, at the outset of this new nation, in the moulding of which I hope to have a part, I gave my vote for a piece of legislation such as a Tariff, placing the burdens of taxation upon the working people of Australia. </para>

That is the general aspect of the county. Now, let us take a typical cotton manufacturing town. We will take Bolton, because I know it best (and as I said before, I only intend to write about what I know). Let us stand in Bolton Park, which is like an isle of dingy green in a black sea, the charm of the place being utterly obscured by the fact that, from whatever part of it VOl raise your eyes you meet a prospect of smoking towers. .Looking south we can count nearly 200 tall chimneys rising ugly over a mass of brick buildings that look as if they had stood for years in a climate where it rained ink every day. </para>

                        <para>I have seen them fall asleep over their lesson books or tasks, after they have been in the factory all the morning (six hours). They were generally dull and sleepy, and it was often downright cruelty to force them along the curriculum fixed by the education code : but the schoolmaster, no matter how tender his heart, was forced to prick them to the pace, or risk censure, and perhaps loss of place, for not keeping the school up to the standard and getting the expected amount of Government grants at the annual examination. In spite of the alleged sharpness of half-timers, no schoolmaster likes them. The testimony of all the teachers in Lancashire is with me on this point, that half-timers, as a rule, hamper and hinder the progress of the rest of the class. </para>
                        <para>Archdeacon Wilson, of Rochdale, in an article on "Half-timers," writes: - "There is the physical health point of view. Now, from this point it is perfectly clear that the children, especially from the neglected homes, suffer. I caused all the boys in my boys' school to be weighed and measured in the autumn of 1891, before the halftime age was raised from ten to eleven.' </para>

                        <para>The results were disputed, and the Rochdale School Board of that date willingly took the matter up, and made similar measures in their schools. Their figures confirm mine, and showed that while children who are not half-timers grow uniformly in height and weight from the age of eight to that of twelve, our Rochdale children, many of whom were half-timers, received a sudden check in the rate of growth at ten, and the lower rate was continued till the age of twelve. Our children are below the average size, even at eight, nine, and ten, from many causes, chiefly improper food and early neglect; but the disparity was even greater at eleven and twelve. These measures were repeated at the end of 1.894 in my school (the newly-elected school board refused), and, since the half-time age had been raised in the meantime to eleven, the measures were of much interest. It became quite plain that the check in the growth at ten had disappeared, and that a much slighter check was apparent at eleven. In other words, these measures, so far as they went, proved that the work of these children in the mills from ten to eleven stunted their growth. </para>

                        <para>The promising child of ten degenerates into the lean and sallow young person of thirteen ; and this process is continued until a whole population becomes stunted ; and thus the conditions of life in factory towns become a real source of danger to England's future. After 25 years' observation of factory life, I have no doubt that the height, weight, and physique of Lancashire factory hands is below the average of England. The deficiency is greater iu full-timers than in half-timers, and is not made up iu adult life, but goes on in accelerated ratio. </para>

                        <para>It must be borne in mind that the medium average of Lancashire factory children is not equal to the average elsewhere. The latter standard is hardly reached by the 341 children described as superior (out of 2,000 examined), while the medium division (1,10(5 of the 2,000) is greatly below the standard of good health. This is much more distinctly marked amongst children of thirteen - "full-timers" who have passed some years in the factory - than it is in those of ten years of age. Of (iO healthy children, averaging thirteen and a half years, and taken as they came (31 girls and 29 boys), the average weight was 74 lbs., or 14 lbs. below the average of good health elsewhere. </para>

Figures have been set before us. with a view of proving that factory children go to work earlier in protectionist Victoria, than they do in free-trade New South Wales. I am attempting to prove that in England they go to work at a more tender age than they do in any protected country throughout the whole of Europe. The right honorable and learned member for East Sydney says that the trades unions of England are strong enough to get exactly what they want. I will show what one of the strongest unions in that country - the Bolton operative spinners - said in their annual report, which was issued in April, 1891, of the disadvantageous conditions under which the adult spinner has to labour.

That is what may be seen in England to-day, and that is what some honorable members wish to see in Australia. They desire to reduce our school age, and have our children working half-time as in England after 50 years of free-trade, and they would like to see women working on pit banks and in brickyards. I for one am prepared in the interests of the worker to fight for improved conditions. If we manufacture the goods here I am convinced that either this Parliament or the State Parliaments will be able to enforce such terms as will materially improve the condition of the workers, whereas, if our goods are manufactured 12,000 or 15,000 miles away, we can have no knowledge of or control over the circumstances under which the work is done. </para>

                            <para>- No ; but I was in England at the time of the coal lock-out in 1892, when two miners were shot down at Petherstone. Perhaps the honorable member has forgotten the occasion when the military were drafted into the district as the police were on duty elsewhere - Lord Masham's were the mines concerned - in order to protect the present King of England, who was visiting Doncaster races. There was fear of a riot, and two miners, who were walking along the road, nearly three-quarters of a mile away, were shot down. America is not the only place where workers are shot down when striving for their rights. We have been told by the honorable member for Parramatta that the trades unions are better organized in New South Wales than in Victoria ; but, so far as I know, that is not the case. </para>

                            <para>- Then it must have been said by some other honorable member. However that may be, I say that in Melbourne on Eight Hours Day we had a better procession than they had in Sydney. I had the honour, when working at my trade last year, to be a member of the Eight Hours Day Committee, on which there were represented 78 societies, as against the 38 societies represented on the Sydney committee. It will be seen, therefore, that in Victoria we have nearly double the number of societies that they have in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable member. Throughout Australia we have a very strong organization in the Engineers' Society, which is practically as powerful in one part of the continent as in another. I have here the last report of that society, issued in August last, and I find that the pattern-makers, who comprise about 25 per cent, of the members, are paid ls. per day more in Melbourne than they are paid in Sydney, and that in all the other branches of the trade the wages are equal in the two States, while in Melbourne an allowance is made for overtime, which is not the case in Sydney. We have been told that whenever a strike or lock-out occurs in any of the other States blacklegs from Victoria take the places of those on strike. I should be sorry if that were the case, and I trust it is not so ; but if it were, we are no worse in that respect than they are in any of the other States. There has been a strike in an engineering firm in Melbourne, and the men who came to take the place of the unionists were blacklegs from Sydney, who are working here to-day. It will be seen that Victoria is not the only place which furnishes blacklegs when a strike occurs ; and what I have stated is on the authority of the secretary of the Engineers' Society. If things are so much worse in Victoria than they are in New South Wales, how is it that the ironworkers of Mort's Dock struck to get the same terms as the Victorian ironworkers ? How is it that the tailoresses struck to get the same wages as tailoresses were receiving in Melbourne? We have heard a great deal about the boot trade. It has been stated that this trade is in a worse condition in Victoria than in New South Wales - or at any rate in no better condition - although there are no wages boards in Sydney. Unfortunately, I have left at home two letters which I had intended to read bearing upon this question. One is from a manufacturer who employs the largest number of hands in Australia in the manufacture of boots. He manufactures in Melbourne as well as in Sydney, and in this letter he gives me the information which I shall quote later on, when the items of the Tariff are under consideration in committee. The wages he mentions as paid in Sydney are absolutely the same as the rates furnished by the secretary of the Sydney Boot Operatives Union. One of the representatives of the trade on the Trades Hall Council of Sydney told me that one cannot find 300 bootmakers in that city who have earned 25s. per week for the last six months. That is the position as stated by a man who is in a position to know, and it is borne out by the manufacturer's letter. The wages received in Melbourne are set forth in the report of the Victorian Factories Inspector. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry that I should have referred to the Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition in the way I have done. I am so accustomed to platform speaking, that I forgot for the moment that I should not refer to honorable members personally. I did so from no desire to speak of them in a derogatory sense. At the Queensland federal election I fought an ardent free-trader, who was a straight-out follower of the leader of the Opposition. I ' contested the election on the labour platform. I put labour in front of everything. I am so loyal to my party that if the majority were to say, " We have to vote for protection," I should be ready to sink my fiscal opinions and vote loyally with the party. That is how I feel in regard to fiscalism. Nevertheless, I gave my pledge to the electors that I would vote for free-trade. I said also that I would not vote one pennyworth of protection to any individual industry that could get along without it. If industries, such as are to be found in Victoria, which have been in existence for years, and have been protected up to 35 and 40 per cent, are unable to get along without further assistance, the sooner they are allowed to go to the wall the better it will be. The honorable member for Yarra has made some reference to child labour in Britain. No one deplores its existence more than I do, and I am sure that every honorable member shares with me that feeling of regret. But before we refer to the dirtiness of our neighbour's house, we should set our own in order. Children under thirteen years of age have been employed in factories in this State, and I give all praise to those who brought that fact to light. They deserve, . not only the thanks of Victoria, but of the </para>

                            <para>- I know the money has to be raised, and I am not such a lunatic as to trouble the Treasurer. It rests with us as legislators to face the situation as we find it. We should not find fault with a proposal simply because it is put forward by the Government or by the Opposition. I am sent here to do my best for the Commonwealth and I am going to do it whether some people like it or not. I was returned practically on the free-trade ticket. I received a good many free-trade votes outside the labour party, and but for that fact, perhaps, I should not have been returned with the large majority that I secured. I recognise, however, that had I declared myself a follower of the Prime Minister I should still have been returned. I do not think, however, that the Government have treated us fairly and squarely. A few of us of the rank and file have been treated as second-raters. In the early stages of the debate all the big guns got off their speeches, and left us to mark time, and to do the scavenging. I honestly believe that if we had adjourned at half-past eleven o'clock last night, and resumed at nine o'clock this morning, we should have been in exactly the same position as we are in now. In fact, if that course had been taken I should have waived my right to speak, and I know that many others would have done the same. </para>

                            <para>- I am reminded by the interjection of the speech which the right honorable and learned member delivered two or three weeks ago. A very large amount of his indignation was bottled up because large duties were not put on silks, velvets, furs, plushes, pianos, and diamonds. Duties on such articles are really not protective duties; this State does not want them, and it has never desired them. When the right honorable and learned member chose those duties for his especial attack, and caused the press throughout Australia to make attacks on the Government because the articles had not been taxed sufficiently - he should have remembered that he was attacking, not protectionist, but revenue duties. Taking the Tariff which he introduced into New South Wales, what do I find ? I find that, instead of the enthusiasm and sympathy for the workers which he at the present time expresses, his revenue duties were imposed in nearly every ease upon the necessaries of life. </para>

I tried to get them the other day in the Parliamentary Library, but ascertained that they had been taken away by the honorable member for Macquarie. I have not been able to get them since, so that I am not able to quote the right honorable and learned member's exact words. It must be known to the House that the argument has been repeatedly advanced that there are more factories in New South Wales than there are in Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- That is the position which the New South Wales free-traders, take up. But if honorable members will peruse the essays written by the leader of the Opposition, they will find it distinctly laid down by the author that no manufacturing industries can be established except by means of cheap and poorly paid labour. Let us assume for one moment that the arguments of the New South Wales free-traders are correct, and that there are more factories in New South Wales than there are in Victoria. Does not the right honorable and learned member for East Sydney give away the whole position by stating that those factories can only be built up by poorly-paid labour? That, I think, is the strongest argument that could possibly be urged against a free-trade policy. The right honorable gentleman has written another book, which is also in the library, and in which he speaks of the duties which were imposed on industrial products in New South Wales some years ago. In that book he expressed himself as very glad to see that the amount representing imports had decreased, a fact upon which he considered the State had to be congratulated. How different are those expressions from the statement he made to the House when submitting this motion. He now regards imports and exports as branches of trade which are equally to be encouraged, and contends that the more imports, the more ' prosperous we are as a community. The book to which I have referred was a handbook of New South Wales, not issued for perusal in this House in order to get the " voice of Melbourne " or the " voice of Sydney," but published to be read by reasonable men abroad, whom he was endeavouring to induce to settle in the State which he represents. He then pointed out that her imports had decreased by £2,000,000 odd, as compared with those of some years before, and expressed the pride he felt that the people of the State were able to manufacture the goods they required, urging that what was wanted was not federation but immigration. All this shows how absolutely inconsistent is the free-trade mind, and how impossible it is, at any rate for the right honorable member, unless he accepts the logical conclusion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, to do other than get into a morass, where he will flounder about in vain efforts to extricate himself. The first clause of the motion refers to the financial proposals of the Government as being on an unsound and extravagant basis, and it is just as well to remember who it is that submits that motion, and what is his past financial career. We must recollect that we are asked to express that opinion in relation to a gentleman whom we on this side of the House believe to be the best Treasurer the Commonwealth could possibly have selected. But let us take the past career of the leader of the Opposition, and see what a financial authority he is. When he introduced direct taxation in New South Wales he found it quite impossible to supply the needs of the State without the assistance of the proceeds of sales of land and increased loans. During the four and three quarter years he was Premier of New South Wales, there were sales of land to the" amount of £10,400,000, and increased loans representing £4,500,000, or a total of nearly £15,000,000 of absolute capital which the right honorable member had to use in order to keep his finances straight. That was a natural consequence of free-trade, and I can quite imagine that the State Treasurer of New South Wales should regard it as absolutely a God-send that federation should stop him from the consequences of his own acts.

                            <para>- Pish, rice, eggs, and things of that sort. Do we want to live like the Japanese ? I venture to consider that we do not. We want English money, and plenty of it, and Australian food, and plenty of it, and I say that at rates like those I have quoted we could not get it. If we throw our workers into competition with men who work at these wages, and under these conditions, where shall we be? We shall be hopelessly out of it. I wonder if there are many here who desire to throw us into competition with paupers working under the conditions to which I refer. I got these figures, I am glad to be able to say, from official sources. There is no room whatever to doubt their accuracy. The wages are higher than they were some time ago, much higher. We can judge what they were some time ago, when these are the highest to which they have reached. I give them to honorable members for what they are worth, and I venture to say that a consideration of figures of this sort will let honorable members know what freetrade will mean for Australia if she be thrown into unrestricted competition with the whole of the world. Here are some more of the rates paid in Japan : - Clogmakers, lOd. ; dyers, 8d. ; blacksmiths, ls. 2|d. ; founders, ls. Id. ; potters, lOd. ; lacquerers, ls.; paper-makers, 9d. ; compositors, 10£d. ; printers, 9|d.; shipwrights, ls.; gardeners, ls. Id.; agricultural labourers, 7 Ad. ; female agricultural labourers, 7¼d. ; silk reeling, 6d. ; weavers, lOd. ; female weavers, 6d.; coolies, 9½d.; and fishermen, 10½d. I say that these are men with whom I do not wish to see anything approaching freetrade. Expose Australian workers to competition with men who produce articles under these conditions and I say they cannot live. Better, indeed, that they did not attempt to live, if we were to strike down the barriers which many States have already provided against competition of this sort, and if we were to subscribe to conditions which a section of the people in one part of Australia, and the people of only one other place in the Empire, the United Kingdom itself, have subscribed to. </para>

                            <para>- It is a terrible thing to get hold of figures and mix them up. A " Little Buttercup," who mixes the babies up, is not half so bad as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, when as a financial " Little Buttercup " he gets stumbling amongst figures. They are not his forte ; they are not mine. But I do not like these great authorities to get up and talk to us on the subject of figures as if they were conferring a favour upon us, with the air of the superior person and pedagogue combined. It is a little too delightful to prick them with criticism, and to find that they are really human, because otherwise we might be induced to worship man rather than his Maker. This £66,000,000 is the one figure which the Opposition have got hold of, and they have got a bit tangled up over it. </para>

Is he at fault with his arithmetic, or is Cocker wrong ? Why are the rules of arithmetic set at naught by him ? If he makes 15 per cent, of £66,000,000- £4,800,000, he does that which no other arithmetician ever did. The boys in the second class of a State school would get soundly smacked if they produced a result of that sort. </para>

I would suggest to the honorable and learned member that he should not draw a bow at a venture in these matters of calculation. Of course some of these cottons might possibly have got into clothes ; and America produces some clothing, and she imports some. I do not think I would be dealing honestly with the honorable and learned member if I did not quote the figures. Here they are : American manufactures, £111,000,000 worth of clothing for her own self. And how much does the honorable and learned member think she imports? </para>

Their reputation as financiers has gone ; it is necessary for them before they talk finance to have recourse to primary schools, for the purpose of being instructed in elementary rules. I am sure that they will feel that, for the safe-conduct of their business, it is highly desirable that they should receive a little further instruction before dealing with large amounts. The amount is £4,600,000, out of £111,000,000- not 4 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- Because the suggestion is that America sends cottons to England for the purpose of being manufactured there, and shipped back for her own use. So far from that being so, honorable members on the other side have jumped to a conclusion which is not justified by facts, and the simple position is that, as regards cotton, not 8 per cent. is sent back from all the world, and as regards clothing, not 4 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- The woollen goods are to Australia what the cotton goods are to America. That is as simple as simple can be, and the honorable member ought to be able to see it with his eyes shut. What I venture to argue is, that we ought to manufacture our woollens here in the same way as they are able to manufacture their cotton goods in America, where they produce the raw material. Even if America does, as has been stated, send away £66,000,000 worth of cotton to England, that is exported after manufacturing practically every ha'porth of clothing that she wants, and if we can do anything like that regarding our wool as well as in regard to our wheat and flour, we shall arrive at a far happier condition of things in Australia than we have hitherto experienced. As to the statements that have been made with reference to American trade with England, I say at once that next to Australia, I look upon England as the nearest and dearest to us, and I do not quote these figures for the purpose of gloating over any decay or decline in her commerce. We all have the best wishes towards England, God knows, and we all wish good speed to her. But the cotton trade of England with America has fallen off - there is no doubt about that. From 1870 to 1874- five years - the cotton manufactures sent by Great Britain to the United States amounted to581,000,000 yards. On the other hand in the four years from1885 to 1889 the British exports of cotton goods to the States fell to 224,000,000 yards- a loss of 357,000,000 yards, or three-fifths of the whole. I think that figures of that sort go to establish the position for which I so strongly contend, and justify me in what I have said. </para>

                            <para>- I am not dealing with that question. Of course England has opened up fresh markets for her cotton goods, but naturally, as the result of protection in America and other countries, her trade with them has been restricted. I should like to say something further with reference to the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Parkes. He made some suggestion that struck me as very extreme when he was criticising the action of the Treasurer, the Attorney-General, and myself in connexion with the Tariff. He put it that after the Prime Minister had spoken at Maitland we ran off to our several States - I am not quoting the precise words of the honorable and learned member, but I do not wish to misrepresent him - and that we there declared that the proposed Federal Tariff would be a bastard free-trade Tariff. </para>

He discovered, after some period of incubation over the figures, that the amounts that we were putting before the House - particularly the Treasurer's figures - were not correct, and that, as a matter of fact, instead of taking £34,000,000 imports as we had done, £41,000,000 was the total shown by the figures for 1900. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing that at all. I am addressing myself to the question of whether or not our estimate of £34,000,000 as the annual value of our imported goods is a right one. I should like further to put it to honorable members that in our difficult task at this moment we are entitled to some degree of sympathy and assistance. I believe that we shall get that sympathy and assistance from many honorable members, irrespective of the side of the House upon which they may sit. I am sure that when our difficulties are fully explained we shall have the best wishes of the Australian public in striving to surmount this trouble. I feel that on an important occasion such as is involved in the framing of the first Federal Tariff, we have at least a right to expect absolute fair play from all sides, and I do not hesitate to say that in many respects we are not getting that fair play. I have only to refer to the way in which every trifle in connexion with the Tariff is magnified; how every representation is made for the purpose of inducing a feeling against the Tariff ; how business men are, in some cases, imposing upon the general public by making the Tariff an excuse for raising prices when they ought not to be so raised. Let honorable members consider the extent of our difficulties. There was not a very large majority in New South Wales in favour of federation. The minority, or many of them, and the opponents of federation elsewhere, are in some cases only too glad to take advantage of any excuse to justify them in exclaiming - "I told you so." We cannot complain of the public. No one likes to be taxed. Customs taxation may not be so direct as other forms of taxation, but at the same time it comes home in a variety of ways to the household, and especially any alteration of it. Those who feel that where they were formerly free they are now taxed, or that where they were previously taxed they are now taxed to a higher degree, naturally wish that it were otherwise. So we find the criticisms to which I allude. . But I do claim that at a time like this, when revenue is an absolute necessity, each and all of us should do what we can for the purpose of letting the public appreciate what is the true position. It is not a question of their entire freedom from taxation. They cannot have that. The money must be had. If it is not obtained in this way it must be obtained in some other. It is idle to attempt to shift it from one to the other. All must bear their fair share. I venture to affirm that if this subject were considered by the general public .in that aspect there would be a disposition to recognise the necessities of the case, and to make the best they could of the obligations which they are called upon to discharge in the interests of and as the price of federation. I especially sympathize with the people of New South Wales. It would be idle to do otherwise. They have been brought up recently under a fiscal system which imposes little of these burdens upon them. Consequently, they feel the change more than others. Speaking roughly, their taxation is almost doubled. A million and a half we may say - I propose generally to speak in round numbers - is to be taken from them. But not only the Government, but all the members of this House, and the Opposition in particular, should join iu pointing out that this was the' inevitable result, and was what was contemplated and intended ; that whilst we require this money from the people of New South Wales, it does not go into the pockets of others ; that they are not charged one penny per head more than is charged per head to the inhabitants of the smaller States ; that they get the money back subject to their fair contribution of federal cost on the basis of population - every penny of it ; and I venture to consider that they can make very good use of it. If these things are pointed out there will be a very different disposition exhibited than has been shown in this connexion hitherto. Was this taxation necessary ? Was this high Tariff necessary ? </para>

                            <para>- Protection second, after revenue. The cry that we have been false to our pledges is too preposterous to be seriously considered. Any excuse on the part of these gentlemen, these partisans, is used for the purpose of attacking and of criticising the Government. Let the flag be low or let it be high, it is all the same to them - it is either not high enough or the reverse. We came here with certain support. When I mentioned the subject before the electors, I referred to the Maitland speech, and said - "This is our programme - revenue, and, after that, protection - moderate protection." We invited the people to try it, and they are trying it now. We believe that the verdict will leave no room for doubt. As to the question of revenue, let me put this consideration to any honorable member who had a seat in the Convention. I might even put it to the leader of the Opposition himself. What was contemplated at the time we framed the Commonwealth Bill, a high or a low Tariff? </para>

                            <para>- I use the words of the leader of the Opposition, and I say that his proposal - not expressed in the Convention itself, but afterwards - was that we should have a very high Tariff. A very high Tariff means protection incidental to the imposition of revenue duties. I go further. I say that the amount even was contemplated. But before I proceed to deal with that part of the argument, I should like to put the matter thus : Was it not clearly stated within the walls of the Convention that the financial necessities of the States could only be met by a high Tariff? I could quote from many speakers in that great gathering, but it will be more important to quote from the utterances of the leader of the Opposition himself. Out of his own mouth I shall be able to prove that he promised a very high Tariff, that he contemplated the raising of a sum closely approximating to that which we are proposing to raise, and that lie made it as clear as the noon day sun that the honor and credit, not only of the Convention, but of the first Federal Parliament, was pledged to meet the necessities of the States. </para>

It is proposed, so far a&amp; regards the present necessities of the States, to take away their almost sole source of revenue, and to refuse them that right which is theirs.

                    <para>There is a sacred trust - an obligation declared in the plainest terms - and the leader of the Opposition thought it inconceivable that it should not be fully recognised. But now the scene changes. The only State to be provided with the same means it at present possesses for maintaining its credit, is that one State, the- requirements of which are the least. All the others are to be treated in the way to which I have referred. </para>

                            <para>- As regards the words of the leader of the Opposition, they can be regarded in two ways. Talking to his Parliament in 1899 on the address in reply, he spoke practically as the Australian Prime Minister designate, or, at least, as a gentleman who fully recognised the responsibilities of. his position. He spoke, not as a party leader, but as an Australian statesman whom we are all proud to know. I have reckoned it amongst the greatest of my pleasures to be associated in various movements with the leader of the Opposition, but I say that he has his varying, moods. He is at his best with responsibility on his shoulders, and at his worst as the party leader he is to-day. In the one case he recognises to the full the national responsibility which rests on him, and in the other case, he is apparently careless, at least for a moment, of the solemn obligation to which he himself has referred in the most picturesque terms. In the New South Wales Parliament in 1899 he spoke thus - </para>

                    <para>An honorable member has suggested that the leader of the Opposition was then speaking relatively. I venture to consider that he could not have forgotten the words he used at that Convention as regards the necessities of the States. I will carry it further, and- show as clear as- the noon-day sun that he contemplated that to meet the necessities of the State in the- circumstances that we recognise we are in at present, there should be at least a revenue of £8,500,000. If I recollect rightly, the amount the right honorable gentleman spoke of in the Town Hall in Sydney a day or two ago - I did not read the full report - was £7,500,000. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but we had the other clause in also. This is not far out from the amount now proposed to be raised, not taking into account the special Tariff. It a little over-estimates the amount of South Australia, but it is a very close shot indeed to what we propose. Honorable members may think that there is a wide gap between£7,000,000 and £8,500,000. </para>

At the same time, I know we all listen with the deepest interest to any observations which fall from the honorable member. He said that we were short as regards three of the States. Tasmania is . to go short to the extent of £150,000 under our proposal ; "Western Australia, £250,000 ; and Queensland, £250,000. Of course I am speaking in round numbers. He said that in the circumstances he was making a calculation after putting the Federal cost at £300,000. The honorable member was making a calculation in his circumstances as a representative of New South Wales.

                            <para>- No ; but the honorable member practically threw one or two alternatives at them. They were to go in for that or local taxation, or retrenchment of a character which would not be possible, certainly in South Australia, to any considerable extent. That was not the position in which the States expected to be placed. That is not the position we have a right to put them in. Whilst we regret that we cannot make greater provision, we do think that we might go to the length we propose. </para>

                            <para>- I know what the honorable member is doing. I do not think he is making any provision for the £300,000 federal cost. South Australia's surplus of £16,000 would be converted into a deficit of £60,000. What does the honorable member think of a proposal like that ? On the one hand the State would pay its way if only by a small margin of £16,000, and on the other its surplus would be reduced by something like £70,000, so that it would be turned into a deficit of £60,000. I claim to know something of the necessities of the State from which I come, and I venture to think that would be a very heavy burden upon her. It would be one which she never contemplated. If she had been told when she was invited to federate that she would have to bear such a burden, then the efforts we put forward to induce her to join in that beneficent movement, would have had to be redoubled in order to secure success. What about Victoria? Under existing circumstances that State would have a surplus of £175,000. The honorable member's proposal, however, would convert that surplus into a deficit of £100,000. Thus we should have five States with a deficiency. </para>

                            <para>- We have had various difficulties in connexion with the federal movement ; in some States greater difficulties than in others. We have had the greatest difficulty in connexion with New South Wales. I do not hesitate to say that New South Wales has stood out for the hardest bargain. She would impose terms which she had no right to impose. She forced the hand of the other States in their love for federation. She got her bargain. The capital is hers. Let me cay in this connexion, and let me not be misunderstood, that no member of the Federal Ministry knows either one State or another in his official capacity, save to do his best for that which is right to all. New South Wales, however, has in my opinion more to gain. What has she gained? She has gained access to our markets. </para>

                            <para>- But as regards the details of what are presented for public consideration - touch this section, that section, and the other section, who likes to be taxed ! Each and all, I would rather say all, meet with ready sympathizers. Those who did not like federation, those who do not like this Government, those who are honestly wedded to free-trade, those who make free-trade an excuse for making a party attack, foment and stimulate agitation by saying - "Oh, yes, you ought not to be taxed so unfairly, No ! no ! the idea is preposterous." The honest way of looking at it and dealing with it is to say to all of them that the thing must be faced. If a lesser sum will suffice well and good, but the money must be had. It is the price to be paid for federation, and all we ought to strive here to do is to find out what the amount is, and what is the best way in which it can be raised. He would be a poor debater indeed who, having such a fertile theme on which to raise public discord, were unable to raise, as it were, a storm of indignation as regards the Tariff, which must tax where taxation did not previously exist, and which in the great senior state of all doubles the taxation on each man and woman of that great community, but doubles it only in accordance with the necessity which had to be faced. Was not this predicted by all who previously considered the matter ? As the honorable member for Wentworth said in most graphic language, ought it not to be disclosed to the people at the earliest possible moment in order that they should nerve themselves to stand the shock and regain the equanimity which is necessary for the purpose of finding the best solution of the difficulty. How have we been served by the Opposition ? Have they adopted tactics of the character to which I referred ? They have spoken here, there, and everywhere. Was it to allay, to soothe, to enable the people to face a national emergency? Nothing of the sort. To provoke, to irritate, to try to get an excuse for indignation, to foment discord and to promote strife. But I am inclined to believe that here we have a calmer atmosphere, and if this debate should end, as it no doubt will end to-day, in the failure of the attempt to overthrow the Government, we shall address ourselves with determination and success to the duty of considering each and every item in detail, and providing that which is best under the circumstances. It is for reasons such as that that I do not propose, knowing what the fate of this motion is to be, to deal with details at the present moment, and so promote anything in the shape of waste of time. What do the Opposition suggest? We have heard little or nothing. The honorable member for North Sydney put forward something gently, gingerly. He would not father it, and the leader of the Opposition would not father it. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased, indeed, that the honorable member has interjected, because in nine cases out of ten, that is the position. People cannot transfer themselves at a moment's notice from one source of occupation to another. We know how difficult it is very often for men to obtain employment in their own particular trade or occupation. Take them away from their own trades, and send the money out of the country to purchase imported goods from elsewhere, and what is the result ? Instead of the £1,000 being spent within the four corners of the Commonwealth in the way of wages, or of reward to the producer to be expended by him in supplying his various wants, in supporting local tradesmen, in giving revenue to the Commonwealth through the Customs, and thus recouping much more than the original loss, if we come to examine the matter, it is as plain as is the noon-day sun that these considerations should undoubtedly speak all eloquently in favour of the smaller sacrifice in the difference of the prices for the good of all. </para>

                            <para>- Adam Smith has spoken with no uncertain sound as to. the importance of stimulating the home market. As regards this question of cheapness - what does it amount to ? Cheapness - think what it means ! Unprotected competition with all the capital, skill, cheap labour, and unrestricted conditions of labour and employment in the old world, and in every country. What is the good of Early Closing Acts, the eight hours system, and wages boards, conciliation or otherwise? How can we, if we admit these goods free into our markets, impose our benevolent conditions upon those who manufacture them ? What is the object of striving to do all we can within our borders to regulate the employment and conditions of labour, when by the free admission of goods, which may have been produced under the most horrible unrestricted sweating, we force our workers to undersell or to suffer by going unemployed and starving. Cheapness ! What is the good of cheapness if the people have not the money to take advantage of it? What is the good of having boots sold at 10s. per pair instead of 12s. 6d., if the people have not the 10s. to pay for them? Is it not far better that the people should have to pay the larger sum, and have the money with which to pay ? What is the prospect of men, who insist on decent conditions of life and labour, being able to compete with those who subscribe to no such conditions ? Whether it be increased capital or better machinery, we should set our standard of life and labour as free and high as may be. Do not go to extremes, but, having set that standard, recognise what are the conditions of the world, and do not hesitate to impose, by a fiscal policy, such terms on the importations of goods as shall insure effect being given to our will. That cannot be done except by protection, without which our laws are as idle as idle may be. What are we told here time and again ? Wo are told that because wages boards exist here, and wages under the circumstances are higher and the conditions of labour better, Victorian workers must go to the wall. If that be the case with regard to competition with our neighbours of the other States, how much more so must it be the case in regard to lower conditions of life and labour ? Let us look the matter fairly in the face. Are we going to tackle this question as we ought to ? If we are content to pass legislation for the purpose of protecting against competition within the prescribed circle of Australian jurisdiction, what is the good of it if at the same time we admit free goods, which are not produced under similar conditions of life and labour, to compete with, oust, and render unemployed our workers. </para>

                            <para>- I am delighted to have the inquiry made by the honorable member for Wannon. I know perfectly well that a question from him comes with the simple desire not to throw me in the slightest way off my course, but to direct my attention to some matter which is troubling him. How do I propose to protect the primary producer and his workman? What is protection? It is assistance given by the inhabitants of a State or Commonwealth through the public purse, in order to protect industries for the good of the community. It may be that we cannot give protection in that way to the primary producer, but so long as the assistance comes to him from the same public - from' the same purse, same pocket, and from the community of the Commonwealth - it matters little how it comes. We ought to protect and assist the primary producer in every way possible, and that is, and has been, our policy for years. With what effect have we laboured in that behalf ? We have given cheap land, and where in that connexion did we hear of the doctrine - " Buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest." If we chose we could sell the State lands for cash to capitalists who would let them out to the primary producer and charge the latter exorbitant rent. But that is 'not what has been done. Had it been a simple question of cheapest and dearest, the State might, so far as direct results are concerned, have done much better. But in the long run would it have been better? And I similarly ask whether in the long run it would be better if the workers and manufacturers were unemployed and our capita] sent elsewhere for the purpose of fostering the enterprise of foreign manufacturers and foreign -workers ? The primary producer has been given not only cheap land, but also cheap money through State banks and other similar institutions, and cheap access to and from the farm and market by means of State railways, roads, jetties, bridges, and in every conceivable way in which money could be expended 'for the public good. </para>

                        <para>For the benefit of the masses, it is not enough to make things cheap, even in the best sense of the word. What is wanted is, to make them accessible, attainable, by the multitude. By making- things cheap, you do not necessarily make them accessible. Nay, there are some modes of making things cheap which, as we have seen, will make them less accessible to the multitude than they were before. What the masses want is the means of purchase. If the means of purchase be wholly absent, it is a matter of supreme indifference to them whether things be dear or cheap. The only means of purchase which they possess are the wages of their labour. In a word, employment is their means of purchase. You may have cheapness without full and various employment for the masses, that is cheapness but without plenty. You may have full employment for the masses at good wages, without the cheapness; that may be competency, or even plenty, without cheapness. The aim of all good legislation should be to unite the two blessings - cheapness and plenty. But if, as often happens, in the imperfection of human affairs, you have to choose not only between two evils, but sometimes also between two good things, inconsitent with each other, which of the two is to be chosen - cheapness for the benefit of a few, or plenty for the benefit of all? Undoubtedly, plenty. Then the study of every Government, in order to produce plenty, permanent plenty, plenty widely diffused and extending to the masses, should be the full and various productive employment of the people. The test of every measure ought to be, and used to be this - "Will it promote the productive employment of the people ?" It has been already shown, and on the authority of Adam Smith himself, that the production of articles at home which can be made or grown somewhat cheaper abroad, though it should not produce cheapness, does promote the productive employment of the people - does give them the means of purchase-does produce plenty, permanent plenty, plenty widely diffused, plenty extending everywhere to the masses of the population ; and that the opposite policy, even under the most favourable circumstances, though it should and will create cheapness, will destroy the means of purchase, and introduce a real and spreading want. </para>

                            <para>- "The China eggs!" I am only too delighted to hear a remark of that sort from the right honorable gentleman, for it only shows how ignorant he is of the history of his own State. The right honorable and learned member does not know that a protection of that sort is very necessary, as regards his own particular State, and for this reason : She cannot provide at present, owing to a want of encouragement of the agricultural egg supply, for her own necessities ; and she has to have recourse to the Celestial Empire for the purpose of procuring what is wanted. It is just a typical case. Here is this great State, with her unlimited resources, her large area of country, everything - but wise statesmen. </para>

Just see the difference in New South Wales ; they cannot produce their own eggs ! Contrast that with what obtains in South Australia. South Australia not only produces all the eggs that she wants herself, but she sends many to New South Wales, and exports - it is a very interesting item - upwards of £80,000 worth of eggs annually. New South Wales cannot export a single one, and has to go elsewhere for the purpose of making up the supply required by her own people. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing which would give greater pleasure to the Government than providing for the freedom of the necessaries of life. They naturally think that it is a fair thing that, so far as the means of existence are concerned, the food of the people should go untaxed. But they know full well that the greatest outcry has been provoked against this Tariff on account of the revenue duties which, owing to financial conditions, are imposed upon the food supplies of the people. If we get a chance of reducing the duties, our first thought, I venture to think, will be to turn in the direction of the freedom of the necessaries of life. I say, further, that we feel also that as regards a good many of these items, we have provided taxation upon raw materials for manufactures, which we should be glad, indeed, to relax. , We think that the margin is often too little between the manufactured article and the raw material. It is not our will, but the national poverty which consents. If, in the future, we can see an opportunity of providing for further freedom of necessaries or raw materials, rely upon our heartiest wishes being with proposals to that effect, which, if we could, we should have been only too glad to have introduced in the first instance. The national necessity is to make both ends meet. Our necessities in the way of revenue production compels proposals of this sort, and I say here, lest it be thought that ray enthusiasm in this respect is lately born, that fourteen years ago I was a member of the Playford Government, who introduced a Tariff to South Australia, in which provision was made for the freedom of the articles of the breakfast table, tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar - I am not sure about kerosene. I would that circumstances had permitted the introduction of relaxations of such taxation into this Tariff. In America, how do they know the difference between the protectionists and the free-trader and the revenue tariffist? The free trader has a defined policy, approved by Henry George; but what is Henry George's attitude as regards a revenue Tariff? He scoffs at it; he tells us practically that a Customs Tariff can only be justified on grounds of protection, We are protectionists ! We are not Henry Georges ; but we believe that it is a good thing that the food of the people should be free, especially if not produced here. In America, under a protectionist Tariff, tea comes in untaxed. If we were here to provide for a simple relaxation, honorable members can well imagine what would be our delight.

                            <para>- A free-trade Tariff? I shall talk to the honorable member about that in a moment. What is the meaning of an exotic industry ? It means an industry which is not largely wanted, an industry which is not natural to our soil and climate. Can the industries connected with our primary productions, and natural to our soil and climate, be called exotics ? Surely not ! It seems to me that our pastoralists, farmers, miners, and manufacturers all constitute industries which are connected with the production of the raw material, and which are of a character that can by no means be called exotic. They deserve encouragement They are all industries which are of particular worth and value to Australia. What success, what assistance do they not render to Australia ? Should we not struggle to do all we can to foster manufactures of that description. In such circumstances is it possible to seriously consider the passing of such a proposition as that which the leader of the Opposition has suggested for the condemnation of the encouragement offered to staple manufactures ? Above all, these should be selected for special encouragement; but, on the other hand, they are selected by the leader of the Opposition for special disqualification. And what produces our Australian wealth? Our staple industries. What are they? They are the industries of the pastoralist, the agriculturist, and the miner. The total value of our national wealth production in connexion with these primary industries is £112,000,000. How much is represented by the agriculturist, the pastoralist, and the miner? The squatter represents, £33,000,000; the farmer and dairyman, £26,000,000; the miner, £22,000,000- making a total of £81,000,000, out of the £112,000,000 of our national annual production from staple industries of Australia. Do honorable members mean to tell me that eight-elevenths of the whole national wealth of Australia are to pay nothing in respect of the establishment of industries, or the maintenance of the establishments of the Commonwealth? Who is going to declare unlimited exemptions in this direction ? If there were such exemptions the necessary revenue could not be obtained. I appeal to members of the Opposition to be men, to be open, to be candid. I would say to them do not seek greedily every opportunity for fomenting discord, for exciting agitation, for sympathizing with the wish, whether deserved or not, of every man or individual, to escape the payment of his due, and the discharge of his obligations to the Commonwealth. The honorable member for Wentworth asked that they should be told that this was their duty and necessity, that the money must be found, and they should be asked whether they were prepared to pay their share. I venture to say that the miner, the squatter, and the agriculturist will respond that they are prepared to take their part, and that they do not want any one to bear their burdens - their fair share of the national obligations. What is their fair share? What is the amount sought to be exacted from these industries in this connexion? Honorable members will be surprised when I tell them how little it is. I have a certificate here from one of my chief officers, who tells me that it is probable that not more than £250,000 will be received from the taxation of the special requisites for these three great national industries. That is the taxation which is I imposed upon them by this particular Tariff. £250,000 out of a total revenue of £9,000,000 ! That is not equal to 3 percent. It is a libel on the farmers and miners and agriculturists to suggest that they wish to avoid the contribution of this infinitesimal proportion of the national expenditure which we are all prepared to pay. </para>

Special requisites, of course, do not include necessaries of life which are common to every one. If we take the total debit against these industries in regard to the items agricultural machinery, tanks, machinery, and engines (not elsewhere included), manufactures of metal (not elsewhere included), disinfectants, vehicles, timber (dressed), other timber, candles, explosives (not elsewhere included), and fuse, the amount is not £500,000, and honorable members know ' that it is not to these industries' solely that matters of this sort can be fairly debited. I should like to say a good deal more in this connexion, but I feel that we have taken a long time in discussing this matter. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is perfectly entitled to make an explanation of that sort. I do not in any sense hold that to be a discourteous explanation, because he, naturally, at present is quite sure about everything ; but as he grows a little older, as we all, unfortunately, have to do, he will not be quite so sure about himself, to begin with. There is no doubt that this is a great occasion. I do not wish to be tempted into discussing any matters of a personal character. I congratulate the Minister for Trade and Customs on delivering a most able and eloquent speech. Much as I differ from my right honorable friend, I have always been in a position to fully appreciate his high qualities, and I think the speech he has made on this occasion is one which every person may read with pleasure. At the same time, it is one of those speeches which can be disposed of practically in one or two sentences. In the first place, the right honorable gentleman has come out of his shell. He has run the protectionist flag up to the top of the mast : it was a fraud on Australia that this thing was not done at first. If ever a Government, when they asked the people of this new Commonwealth to trust them, owed a duty of fearless frankness in, at any rate, defining broad principles of action in reference to matters of great moment to all classes of the community, that was the time. Experienced men, trained Prime Ministers, gathered together, men whom the people were accustomed to address ; and if there is one duty which men whom the people trust owe to them, it is that of treating them honestly and candidly in return. The right honorable gentleman dared not make that speech at any time but the time he has chosen - when the people's voices are stifled, when the people's power is for the time suspended, when the division-lists have been carefully analyzed, when there is no further hope of keeping upon the Treasury benches honorable members who have any regard, for their election pledges. It is, after a singular occurrence in this Chamber, that we at last hear a manly and straightforward, and, from a protectionist point of view, a thoroughly patriotic speech. I have always respected a man who could deal with the subject of protection in the way in which my right honorable friend has done. In all my attacks upon him I have never once for a moment doubted his perfect sincerity ; but I am compelled to make a much graver charge against him than a want of sincerity, and that is a want of candour - that somewhere in Australia he should have made that speech when he was inviting the confidence of the people ; that somewhere in Australia his colleagues should have made that speech when they were inviting the confidence of the people of Australia ; that at Maitland, when the Prime Minister addressed himself to the people of Australia surrounded by his col-: leagues, that speech ought to have been made. When we see three honorable members, whose personal honour, I suppose, no one will doubt, after faithfully and loyally sitting behind the Government; when we see three honorable members one after the other quoting the utterances of the Prime Minister, and proving their disappointment at the difference between his public professions and this Tariff, we see a spectacle which ought to be humiliating either to those three honorable members or to the Ministry. Since these three honorable members have taken that course, has a single constituent addressed them complaining of their action? Has a. single meeting been held in their constituencies to protest against their action ? Throughout Australia, has a single meeting been held to support this Tariff? On the contrary, we find that feelings which the right honorable member the Minister for Trade and Customs, in the pride of place, describes as discord, agitate the Australian community. In his younger days, great manifestations of national feeling - at the head of which he generally was himself - were looked upon as the voice of something very near almighty wisdom. But now that the voice of the people has been heard right over Australia with no uncertain sound, the Australian democracy is in a state of discord. It requires to be soothed, and he appeals to us to soothe the public mind of Australia, to pursue a patriotic course ; not to carry out our pledges, but to help a complacent Ministry to do that which they have not yet had the courage to vindicate on any public platform. We hear of some announcement of New South Wale3 Ministers appearing, in the Town-hall in Melbourne - a very proper thing to do ; but they owed a prior duty to appear in Sydney, or, at any rate, a duty to appear in both Melbourne and Sydney. A Prime Minister, who owes to a constituency of New South Wales his position and his power, should have condescended to soothe the people of Maitland, to soothe the people of New South "Wales, to show that it is only discord, and not the natural indignation of a people who had been deceived. There are times when an Australian population can take things very easily. But there is one thing which Australians are not yet accustomed to regard with complacency, and that is acts of betrayal. The talk was all about compromise ; the talk was all about revenue without destruction ; but now we are getting the candid transparent truth. The way in which to destroy a people is to impose a revenue Tariff. "When the Prime Minister gave, as the key-word of his whole policy - revenue without destruction - he ought to have explained to the people that revenue meant destruction ; that all the main springs of national prosperity, everything that lay at the root of our industrial life, every impulse of humanity called out with one voice - for what1! - for a policy of protection. We are told that if tire people are well employed they can afford to pay taxes, and that the only means of securing them employment is by protection - that is, by a revenue.destoying policy. Although there are some protectionists who are hardy enough to consider that these two principles are in absolute harmony, men without any great pretensions to political eminence, but who have at least a certain degree of common sense, know that if there are two tilings which are absolutely antagonistic, they are the principle of a revenue Tariff, and the principle of a protective Tariff. The principle of a protective Tariff is that imports are a curse, and cheapness is a curse, and that, therefore, imports should be reduced as much as possible. The protectionists say - "Make your Customs revenue small, and your people will be prosperous, strong, and able to easily bear the burdens of a nation." Talk about sacrifices ! The Minister for Trade and Customs does not ask the people to make sacrifices. If he believes what he says, and I know he does, he asks them to enrich themselves. He asks them, by means of this great policy of shutting out all the evils of the sweated world beyond, to insure for labour here peace and plenty; and I say that the man who believes in this principle is out of place under the banner of the man who spoke at Maitland. I regret that the exigencies of my right honorable friend the Prime Minister and his public position compel him to be absent. He cannot help that, nor can I. But I feel now that it is my duty to say - I do not go by what other honorable members have said, as they have to judge for themselves - that I feel that I am only voicing the honest opinion of the great bulk of the people of New South Wales, and certainly of the Prime Minister's constituency, when I say - without accusing the right honorable gentleman of anything mean or treacherous in intent - that, in point of fact, and in point of political result, his speeches were couched in a vagueness of language which would be regarded as sinister if we did not respect him. I admit that he has a habit of speaking in vague terms, but this was a question which required more open treatment. In the first instance these gentlemen who are supposed to be the apostles of federation, appealed to the people to cast aside every other consideration and follow them. They told the people that those who were not associated with them were planning some deep treachery against the Constitution, that the vital principles of the Constitution required that all true federalists should stand side by side. With that assurance, and in that faith, tens of thousands of people who abhor the principles of protection fought under the banner of my right honorable friend. They responded to his call. How absurd was all the talk of conspiring to overthrow the Constitution, surrounded as it is by so many democratic principles and safeguards. The action of the Government showed that some deep political design was concealed behind, and now we find accomplished, at the hands of those who sought to be considered the guardians of the Australian Constitution, an act which makes constitutions of little concern. What is the spirit of our Australian Constitution ? It is that there should be a relation of principle between the people and their representatives in this Federal Parliament. What is the soul that inhabits that sacred shrine ? - the soul of a great democracy ; and surely the elementary principles of honour and candour are required to keep the sacred flame pure. I say that, read in the light of subsequent events, a grave wrong was committed on the people of this country by keeping them in ignorance of what this Ministry was really driving at. We know what New South Wales would have said to that. The Prime Minister would not have been sent here, and several other honorable gentlemen would not have been sent here. I come now to a phase of this subject which strikes me with considerable pain. There has been, I regret to say, a most palpable attempt to conceal the real operation of this Tariff. Who ever thought, when the Customs Bill was being passed, that this sort of monstrous treatment was to be practised under an Australian Tariff? We lead in the misleading schedules of the Tariff that there are certain duties on the articles that are mentioned there, but we find that in the administration of the Customhouse these duties of 30 per cent. or 20 per cent. become10percent higher. And why ? Because the packing charges abroad, the cost of the cases, the cost of the transit from the manufactory to the port of shipment, and a thousand other charges, are added to the value of the goods ; 10 per cent. is added on to these charges, and a 20 or 30 per cent. duty is levied on the total. When the Minister for Trade and Customs was indulging in cheap and carefully prepared orations about large questions of human feeling, I thought he would have done greater service to the community if he had replied to some of the more serious charges against this Tariff which now fill the whole atmosphere of Australia. I have before me an invoice for bottles, which are necessary for use in our great colonial wine industry. I suppose that that is an industry for which we all have some regard. Now, the charges on this shipment of bottles, which is worth £96, amount to £217. That is to say that there is protection of over 200 per cent. in favour of the colonial bottle industry. What do the Customs authorities do? It is true that they do not charge on the freight now, but they charge on the packing and so on, and the £96 becomes £188 by the addition to the prime cost of the article of £92 for charges. Ten per cent. is added to that, which makes £206 16s., and then 20 per cent. duty on the bottles is added to the £206 16s., making a duty of £41 7s. upon a shipment worth £96. </para>

                            <para>- It is utterly immaterial to the man who has to pay the money whether the charges are made under the Customs Act or by any other authority. Here we have an imported article upon which we were told a duty of 20 per cent. was to be charged, whereas the impost practically amounts to 40 per cent. I say that these are frauds, and that if a private individual were to do such a thing as is now being done by the Customs authorities he would be convicted of imposition. It is an imposition on the people of Australia that such frauds should be concealed beneath the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I will hand the documents to the Minister later on. Under this Tariff the duty upon bedsteads, which was formerly 25 per cent., becomes 30 per cent., the duty upon American chairs, instead of being 20 per cent., becomes 30 per cent. That reminds me that when the Minister for Trade and Customs invites the House and the people to turn their eyes to the degraded coloured centres of the East, we know well enough that the labour which protectionists most fear is that of the highly paid workers of the United States. It is not the labour of China, Peru, or Siam, that Victorian protectionists are afraid of, but that of the people whose wages they say are the highest in the world, and of the country where they say the standard of comfort is the highest. Why should the Minister for Trade and Customs employ his great gifts in order to obscure the true issue ? It is not the degraded coloured line that is in my right honorable and learned friend's mind. It is a line to divide the Anglo-Saxon race. It is a line to keep out the American and New Zealander. Do they live under conditions inferior to our own? I say that Ave are doing some good in brushing aside these monstrous hypocrisies. The father of the present Lord Brassey was, I suppose, one of the greatest employers of labour in the world. He employed tens of thousands of men in different countries, and he gave it as his opinion there was no difference in point of fact between paying a superior man high wages and an inferior man low wages. His experience, he said, was that from the varying rates which he paid in various countries and to different workmen, the actual result was about the same. For low wages he got little work, for high wages he got much work. That is the great secret of American supremacy to-day. It is not because the people there are weak, degraded, or effeminate that wages are high in the United States, but because the people represent the cream of human ingenuity and industry. Alas too, it is because the physical strength of the American in the factory is put to a pace of cruel pressure which is unknown even in miserable England. The man has become entangled in the machine and the vast machine must go round with lightning speed crushing him by the way. Let us get rid of these pretences. The honorable member for New England spoke like a man, as he always does. I may differ from that honorable member and from the Minister for Trade and Customs, but I always have a large amount of respect for them, because they invariably give themselves away. The honorable member for New England comes down to this Parliament, a real representative of the old English tory landlord. He hates cheapness. He goes along the shop fronts of Sydney and sees the commoner articles which must be bought by the poorer classes. He says, "These commoner articles in the window are too cheap," and his heart rebels against it, just as did the heart of the tory landlord against the idea of cheap food for the British people 50 years ago. What a horrid thing cheapness was when it would put a loaf of bread upon the table of a family which was starving. </para>

It is not that the workmen here are not the descendants of some of the finest men in the world, who came here from all quarters of the globe.

                            <para>- There is a picture, indeed ! I want to show my gratitude for the forbearance which honorable members on both sides of the House have shown me by condensing my remarks as much as I can. I will throw away mountains of notes which I made in reference to different speeches. I wish particularly to concentrate my remarks upon the speeches delivered by the honorable member for Gippsland and the honorable and learned member for Indi. Without being invidious - because I think that the tone of the debate has been extremely high - if I may take two speeches from among a number of very excellent ones on the other side, I venture to select those two as presenting between them about as strong a statement of the protectionist case as I have heard. Even in the case of those speeches I shall refer to only one or two of the salient points. I feel that I cannot at this time venture to do more than that. I want to refer to one or two remarkable expressions in the speech of my honorable friend the member for Gippsland, in which he described the commercial enterprise of Great Britain, which carries half the commerce of the world under the British flag, as a species of blackmail levied on the producers and distributors of the world. The honorable member used the word " blackmail." </para>

                            <para>- I think my honorable friend -will see that the. work of the British fleet is a work of distributing ; consequently, according to the honorable member, the work of the British mercantile fleet is blackmail. I do not know that any answer is necessary for an honorable member who uses such arguments. Is it not clear that one of the greatest services which can be rendered to the producers of the world is the cheap transit of their productions all over the oceans of the globe? Surely that is an advantage ? This service is rendered by the British fleet, because other nations cannot build their ships as cheaply as the British can. Here is this principle of cheapness again ! What an awful curse it is that enables Great Britain to earn £80,000,000 a year in freights all over the world ? Why cannot the Great Republic, with its vast stores of metals, compete with this little Island in the Seas? Here is Great Britain with her 12,000,000 tonnage against the United States with her 2,000,000 tonnage, Germany with her 2,000,000 tonnage, and Prance with her 1,000,000 tonnage or something more. I look upon the work of the British mercantile fleets, even from a protectionist point of view, in carrying produce from the producer to the buyer, as one of the most magnificent services which the producers of the world can get. Where would our producers be if freights from Australia were 50 per cent, higher than they are today ? Where would the farmer be ? Where would the pastoralist be? Cannot we see that when we come to separate a cluster of nerves, which combine to produce a perfect harmony of energy, we begin to interfere with things that are beyond our control ? What goes to make up the full strength of any nation ? - a thousand different forces, a thousand different factors. I think one of the best tests in the world when we go abroad is, not so much to compare one county with another, as to compare the same country under the two different policies. I think that is a far fairer test. I do not look upon any of these tests as conclusive; they are interesting but not conclusive. But let us take the one country in the world where this cruel policy of free-trade has been in force for 50 years. They had the tender, humane, benevolent policy once; they had that humane and benevolent policy of protection once ; they had that policy which greeted the unemployed father so tenderly when he came home every day, and his children ran out greedily to meet him. I can sum up the climax of that humane policy after centuries of application to one of the grandest subjects for the experiment the world has ever seen, in this way : In the agricultural districts, agricultural labourers were so degraded that they could not pass from one English parish to another without a permit. And why a permit ? Because nearly every one of them was on the pauper list, and a parish would not have a man coming from the books of another parish on to its books. They would not allow them to move from one parish to another, because of the enormous burden of the agricultural labourer upon the poor-rates. We go to the factories, and what do we find ? We find our great manufacturing centres in England seething with sedition. Why % Because of their indigence and abject misery. We go to the mines of England, and we find the mother and the child working down in those dark mines to keep the home even in food. We find the manufacturers in a state of misery and sedition. The labourers in the counties were in the same state, and all over Great Britain they had a paralyzed community. My honorable friend the member for Gippsland says that stagnation set in with free-trade. Again, I say that an honorable gentleman who can make such a statement does not really call for serious notice. Stagnation \ Stagnation for this grand old mother country of ours ! Now, I shall show my honorable friend the sort of stagnation there is in disputes between employer and workmen. I suppose that in this land full of paupers the employer has all the best of it. He has starving men running after him for work ; yet taking the last two years for which I have the figures, 1898 and 1899, I find that in 1898 labour disputes between master and man increased the wages of 1,015,000 workers on an average of ls. 7d. per week each in a fight between cruel capital and starving labour. In the next year there were 1,453 changes in the labour rates of England, 1,436 of which were increases and seventeen were decreases and that affected 1,100,000 workers, and they got increases amounting to ls. 6-J-d. per week each. There are 2,000,000 workers, whose wages have gone up ls. 6d. per week each in two successive years. Now, is not that worth a thousand of the experiences of my honorable friend the member for Gippsland ? I forgive the honorable member for this reason : Every man who changes his religion or his political principles is sure to be more red-hot than any man who has never changed them. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend knows that there are many subjects connected with Ireland which do not make it a fair comparison ; his is a weak interruption. I am not talking about Ireland ; I am talking about one of the most progressive and enlightened communities on God's earth - Victoria. Now, one-tenth of the manhood of this protectionist paradise had to emigrate like the Irish emigrant of 40 years ago. Did he emigrate from high wages, and dignified and comfortable surroundings, to rough it again in the world ?' That one fact ought to talk to labour with a trumpet tongue. A country which drives forth labour out of it is in a bad way. A country like Victoria, which cannot keep 1,200,000 people in it, has been in bad hands. It is a wonderful thing to give old-age pensions, but a thousand times better to keep your men in the country. That one fact cast a black band over Victoria, and is it wonderful that the people of the State feel at last the pressure of this policy which is driving men away ? Every man who goes is a customer lost to 50 industries of Victoria. A man can work in only one line, but he is a customer in 50lines. Every man who leaves is a loss to the country, not a gain, unless you carry the protectionist theory down to the Robinson Crusoe extreme. He was a perfect protectionist in spite of himself. No breath of sweated labour could be wafted towards his free and independent home. No foreigners, no importations, perfect solitude, and perfect wealth ! </para>

This most worthy, grave, and reverend signior was guilty of a very wrong act when he was seeking the support of the people of Tasmania. In order not to do him any injustice - and I can convict him out of his own mouth - I shall take his own explanation of his own programme. He was foolish enough to try to explain the unexplainable, and he solely read to the House a statement of his governing principles. Listen to this - </para>

It is very characteristic of my honorable friend's attitude that when he thinks he is standing he is sitting down. There are some other gentlemen on the other side who honestly ought to have voted with us on this occasion - I mean gentlemen like the honorable member for Moira, the honorable member for Wimmera, and the honorable member for Laanecoorie. lam not putting those honorable members forward as free-traders, because I know that they are protectionists, but they are protectionists who distinctly stated to their constituents that they would be no parties to a high Tariff. Now, this is distinctly a high Tariff. My honorable friend the member for Kennedy, the honorable member for Darling, and the honorable member for Wide Bay, are going to vote on the other side. With reference to those gentlemen I have nothing to say, except that it is a source of deep pain to me that they should be called upon to practically vote against their convictions. There is no blinking the fact, and my honorable friends will have the manliness to acknowledge, that they have no sympathy with this Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- Whilst honorable members of this House would take the Treasurer's reference in that way, some of the financial critics of London might seize hold of language of that sort for the purpose of injuring the States. In future let us avoid the use of such words in connexion with any Australian State. The bulk of their debts is for railways, which are an absolutely safe asset. All the States are absolutely sound, and accepting assistance will not affect their solvency or insolvency. I am prepared to go a reasonable way in the direction of putting fresh taxation on the people of New South Wales for this purpose ; but when the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and almost every other honorable member who has spoken on the Government side, have drawn attention to remarks of mine to the effect that the people of the mother State must be prepared for a very high Tariff, I think the least candour should surely be sufficient to protect me from such an interpretation as that I meant a highly protective Tariff. Such a construction of my words is absolutely tortuous. I was addressing people who were accustomed to a phenomenally low Tariff, and . I was bound in honour - and I wish others had fulfilled the honorable obligation as fully - to let the people know of the great change that must come. A sound revenue Tariff of £8,000,000 would involve a great change in taxation in New South Wales, where it would be regarded as very high ; and I erred on the side of candour in putting before the people what the result would probably be. But to endeavour to trap me into a shred of approval of the particular Tariff now under review, as a means of raising a large revenue, is altogether too silly and too unfair. After the all-night sitting which the House has had, I think I ought in fairness to abandon a number of the observations which I should have made had the House been fresh. I feel very much indebted to honorable members for the courteous patience with which they have listened to me, and I feel I shall have a number of other opportunities of dealing with some of the matters to which it would now be convenient to refer. But one remark has been made to which I attach a great deal of importance. The Treasurer impressed on us how wise it would be to give this Tariff the element of permanence; and I thoroughly agree with the right honorable gentleman that that would be the greatest service that we could render to the people of Australia. It is one of the greatest objects an Australian statesman can set before him ; but there is a great difference between agreement on a point of that kind, and the acceptance, as permanent, of a Tariff by men who absolutely protest against it as unrepresentative of the feelings and principles of the people of Australia. We can do nothing as yet, but I hope we shall be able to arrive at some way of putting the Tariff before the people of Australia. There was a time when the plebiscite was ridiculed by a number of politicians in Australia, but the plan has been often used, and I think with great advantage. I admit that it would not be a fair thing to lay before the public the Tariff which the Government have placed upon the table of the House, and ask them the question - "Are you in favour of this Tariff?" That would be an unfair tiling, because it would be inviting every one who had a complaint to vote against the Tariff. I am not one to ask for an issue of that sort ; but we might solve the matter in perhaps a very happy way if, amongst ourselves, we were to consider whether we could not, in some form fair to the Government, send the Tariff to a plebiscite. I have considered the matter a little, and I think there is a fair issue which, put in proper language, might be referred to the people of Australia. I want to put the question in a way fair to the Government as well as fair to ourselves, because it is only in such a way that the proposal I am making can be successfully carried out. I am prepared to take up the invitation of the Treasurer. I am prepared, so far as I am concerned - and I believe I may speak for the party I represent, although we have not consulted - to accept the Tariff of the Government, with such amendments as we may make in Committee, as a permanent Tariff for ten years at least - and even for fifteen years - if the following issue, which, I think, would be fair to the Government, were placed before the people - " Is this, the Government Tariff, a fair basis for the Commonwealth Tariff?" I think that is a fair issue. The people would not be asked to vote for the Tariff, but, to say whether, in their opinion, it is a fair basis for the Commonwealth Tariff. That issue involves the question of principle. Every man in favour of the Government policy - that is, the protective-cum-revenue policy, would say "yes;" and every one in favour of a revenue Tariff without protection, would say, "no." This suggestion would, if anything, give the Government an advantage over the other side. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite willing to place my proposals as to the Tariff in very few lines before the people. I am so anxious to get this question settled and out of the way of members on both sides of the House, that I am not stipulating for any particular way of attaining that object. My desire is that we should hit upon some plan of placing before the people the issue between the Government and the Opposition ; and my proposal would have the effect of settling the question for ten or fifteen years. We must rise above our own personal interests, whether on the Ministerial or opposition side of the House ; and this is a matter which particularly affects every one in the community. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members are paid £400 a year to attend here and do their duty. If they are not prepared to do so they should resign, and allow some one else to fill their places. I fail to see why we should postpone our meeting on Tuesday, even until after seven o'clock. It is all very well for those honorable members who live in Melbourne, but surely they should have some consideration for those of us who live in more distant parts. It is impossible for the Tariff to be finished before Christmas. The result will be a short adjournment, and it is more than probable that during that adjournment a number of honorable members who live in the far north of Queensland will be unable to reach their homes ; probably they will be kept here until March. The Government should take this matter seriously into consideration. Because Cup Day happens to be a holiday throughout Victoria, I fail to see why honorable members who represent the whole Commonwealth should be called upon to observe it when they are here for legislative purposes. I hope we shall meet at the usual hour on Tuesday, and I shall be prepared to divide the House on the question. There is one other matter to which I should like to refer. We have had some three weeks' debate on the Tariff, and I think we might have a change to lighter fare. Our minds are pretty well saturated with the principles of free-trade and protection. </para>

                            <para>- Cannot the right honorable and learned member trust the press ? I rise to say, however, that if I thought there was any likelihood of a quorum I would go on as usual on Tuesday afternoon, but while I know that I can obtain a quorum in the evening, I can see that I cannot get one in the afternoon. That is why I moved the motion. As to the suggestion made by the honorable member for Kennedy, I had really anticipated it, because I have given already, by a public statement, an indication of the fact that the debate on the second reading of the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill will be proceeded with on Tuesday evening. I should like to add for the benefit of honorable members, many of whom have spoken of various objections to the Tariff, that if those objections can be reduced to some concrete form, and the information on which they are founded can be supplied in writing to the Minister for Trade and Customs, the adoption of that course will facilitate their consideration, whether they are agreed with or not. </para>

                            <para>- Hearsay statements on these subjects are not of much value, but, as I said before, I shall be pleased to hand the report for inspection and perusal to any honorable member who wishes it, but I am hot prepared to lay it upon the table. I said, however, that if it were the general desire of honorable members, I would lay it upon the table, because I would not resist the will of Parliament in a matter of this sort. If, however, honorable members will look at the report, and see the extent to which it depends upon hearsay evidence, they will not, I am sure, insist upon its being laid before the House. </para>
