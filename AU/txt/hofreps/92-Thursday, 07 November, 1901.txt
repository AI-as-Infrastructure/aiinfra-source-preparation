                        <para>- At the outset all those who were engaged in the conference took the view that it was purely consultative. A question was raised as to whether certain memoranda should be made public, and it was the opinion of, I think, the whole of the Conference that at such a stage matters would not be helped in any way by making the information public. The Conference was a confidential one, and if we could not have confidential communications under such circumstances it would be impossible in some cases to arrive at any conclusion. </para>

I hope the party with which the honorable member who has just interjected is identified will be a little more reasonable and considerate to others who are not of their own class. Those who are advocating an extension of time to the sugar planters are, I contend, acting more in the interests of the working classes than are the direct labour representatives in this Chamber. The aim of the latter is to destroy the industry. </para>

                        <para>- If the legislation which is now proposed does not actually destroy the sugar industry, it will injure, check, or cripple it for many years to come. We who differ from the labour party are advocating not merely the interests of the working classes, but those of the community as a whole. I appeal to the Prime Minister and honorable members upon both sides of the House to grant this extension of time, which cannot possibly result in any evil. It will, however, enable the planters to secure for themselves other labour. If it be found later on that the sugar industry cannot be conducted without the aid of black labour, I shall be quite agreeable to sacrifice that industry. I certainly do not want a black population permanently located in North Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out that under section 122 of the Constitution, these Pacific Islands may eventually become a part of the Commonwealth. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, "Australia" means the whole of the Commonwealth, including such portions as may at any time become a part of the Commonwealth. If the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth covers New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, I take it that we are making a serious mistake unless we put after every definition of " Australia " in this Bill, the words " as constituted at the commencement of this Act, otherwise the Pacific Islander will not need to enter Australia, as he would already be inside its extended limits." </para>

                    <para>- I trust the government will not relax the terms of the Bill in the slightest degree. So far as the mandate of the people is concerned, I admit that it is extremely difficult at all times to interpret in detail what the people desire, especially under our present complicated system of securing representative government. The honorable member for Wentworth will not contend that it is possible or permissible, while keeping to the letter of the mandate of the people by passing a Bill, to at the same time put off indefinitely the consummation as to which the people are so anxious. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member laid so much stress on the people not having expressed themselves on the details of the measure that his words would bear the interpretation that we ought to wait until the millenium for the cessation of the traffic. The proposals of the Government and the temper and attitude of honorable members show that just consideration has been given to every phase of the subject. It is useless for honorable members to say that the planters have been dealt with in any harsh spirit, when we consider what has been done for them under the Tariff. The proposals of the Government have been accepted practically without protest by every man in the Chamber ; and I am reminded that a number of the planters are agreeable to the compromise. But I go so far as to say that if the time stipulated in the Bill is extended to any appreciable extent, I shall vote against the high sugar duties proposed. I would call the attention of the honorable member for Wentworth to the fact that, from the introduction of the Tariff, the black-grown sugar of Queensland has enjoyed a protection of at least £3 per ton ; and, if those planters continue for some years to come to employ black labour, it must be admitted that the high duties evidence some spirit of justice and some spirit of sacrifice on the part of the people of the other States, who are not directly interested in this industry. </para>

                        <para>- I do not question the honorable member's right to hold that opinion, but I differ from him as to the probabilities. During this year there is practically no labour to be supplanted, and during next year, if any men are deported, the places of three out of four may be filled from blacks imported again from the islands. It will be seen, therefore, that only about one-fourth of the labour during next year will have to be supplied from the ordinary sources. </para>

                        <para>- Surely we have had enough experience of the labour market generally in different parts of Australia to be pretty well certain that so long as reasonable inducements are offered there will be no difficulty in finding men to make good the planters' loss of coloured labour. At any rate, the position I take up is that this Bill represents, so far as the majority of the House is concerned, the extreme limit to which we are prepared to go. I know a great number of honorable members who would have much preferred to see the traffic cease on the instant - who would have been prepared to allow no time whatever in regard to a traffic of this description. The compromise having been offered, and the conditions suggested with regard to the duty, I think that those who have the interests of the planters at heart would do well not to strain too far the patience of a number of honorable members who desire to do justice to the planters, but, who, at the same time, desire to insure that the will of the people is carried out effectively as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>- The feeling I have is that if we extend the provisions of the Bill in the direction of greater leniency to the planters, or in the direction of an increase in black labour, we shall jeopardize the whole scheme. I do not think we can do better than consult the experience of Queensland. If we could be certain that in another five years the whole traffic would quietly drop out of existence, there would not be very much to say in opposition to the proposal of the honorable member for Oxley. But what are the facts? The experiment has already been tried in Queensland, where ten years' grace was given to the planters ten years ago. In that period the planters were supposed to be getting ready for a cessation of the kanaka traffic, but as a matter of fact the traffic has steadily entrenched itself, and instead of its being got rid of, the planters have been steadily putting acres under cultivation of cane, without, so far as we know, taking any steps towards the substitution of white labour. What happened politically during that time? It is well known that circumstances combined to to make a coalition possible in the politics of Queensland, and the result was to sweep away the restriction laws of some years before, and to practically maintain the right of the planters to have kanaka labour in perpetuity. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Parliament is different in some senses, but I am not prepared to say that it is different in regard to this particular point. It is well known that at election times a supreme cry is sometimes raised on which representatives are elected to the Legislature. I apprehend that the Federal Parliament will be no exception to that rule, and it might be that those returned to a future Parliament might have a much more generous disposition towards the kanaka than has the present Legislature - that was the case in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I think the logic would be that where a Parliament is specially selected for a certain work the sooner that work is done the better. I think that the mandate which this Parliament received in regard to the coloured labour question was as clear and specific as any ever given by the constituencies. So far as the New South Wales elections were concerned, the issue was a very live one, and I had to definitely pledge myself to vote for the abolition of black labour as speedily as possible. If we give the planters a nine years' lease of life, they will entrench themselves as they have done in the past, and begin to agitate for the permanency of the traffic. It is not because we wish to be harsh to the planters that we support the Bill, but because we consider that under all the circumstances it is better for them to know exactly ["when and how the system is to cease than to leave them a prey to vain and -false hopes. I consider the provisions of the Bill sufficiently. lenient, and, in my opinion, to extend the time in the manner proposed would not be fair to the planters or to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The production of gold is about three times as valuable as the. production of sugar in Queensland, while the production of the pastoral industry still more largely exceeds it in value. Honorable gentlemen will therefore see that the production of sugar is not the dominating industry in Queensland. I think it will be of interest and advantage to the committee if I read a tabulated statement which I have prepared, showing the annual production of sugar in Queensland from the year 1868 up to the present time. I wish to put this information on record because I think that it will be valuable for purposes of reference. A study of it will show honorable members that when the verdict of Queensland was reversed in 1892, it was reversed contrary to the facts shown by the statistics.

                        <para>- Honorable members will see that there was a great falling off in 1 900, as compared with 1898 ; and although this decrease was entirely due to the bad season, we can quite imagine what would have been said by the friends of the planters if the Bill we are now considering had been passed two years ago. If we had come to the House and stated that the stoppage of the kanaka labour traffic had not affected production, we should never have been able to establish our case ; but the whole of the shortage in the sugar crop would have been attributed to the restrictions imposed upon the employment of coloured labour. If we allow the free recruiting of the kanaka to go on for a number of years, in good seasons such as I hope the planters will have, and they produce even the same amount of sugar as was produced in 1898, the supply will exceed the demands of the Commonwealth, the benevolent purposes of the Government, Tariff legislation will be defeated, and a blow will be struck at the cause of white Australia that will be fatal to every aspiration of those who believe in it. </para>

                    <para>- I venture to support the claim of those who are engaged in the sugar industry to a little consideration at the hands of honorable members. Although we have a mandate from the people of Australia on the question of coloured labour, the responsibility of the particular measures to be taken for carrying out the mandate rests upon us ; and I cannot help thinking that if we legislate in such a way as to deal practically with the crops that are now in the ground, and to upset the existing arrangements of the planters without giving them any notice we shall not be acting as fairly towards them as their position demands. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that when there is a large crop there is always a difficulty in procuring sufficient labour, and if a number of the men who have been permanently engaged in the industry are to be withdrawn, still greater difficulty will be experienced in securing the necessary labour. I have no sympathy with the worst phases of the kanaka traffic, but we cannot at once dissociate ourselves from these evils, which we all deplore, and which we are anxious to get rid of. We have to take into consideration all the issues that are involved, and I hope honorable members belonging to the labour party will be prepared to accept this suggestion, even though they may feel that they are going a little further than they ought to go. A concession on their part will go a long way towards easing the position and reducing the hardship that must result from drastic legislation. </para>

                    <para>- I am not disputing that for one moment. In South Australia, which is large in area, though small in population, the mandate was directed more against the general influx of undesirable immigrants, of whom we have had experience - the immigration of Chinese,. Japanese, and Afghans - than it was against the influx of labourers from the Pacific islands. It was never thought that kanaka labour constituted the danger which it has been represented to be in this House. To some extent this debate has opened my eyes. </para>

State railways. It has never been repealed to this day. As far as the Northern Territory is concerned, there has never been sufficient pressure brought to bear to utilize the provisions of the Indian Immigration Act. Indian coolies can be introduced even now to work upon the State railways of South Australia. </para>

                <para>Mr.V. L. SOLOMON. - At the time the honorable member was leader of the labour party in the South Australian Parliament, what he says was perhaps a fact. At that time any Government which did not happen to suit the party, which was so very ably and courteously led by the honorable member, would not have lasted five days. The question of whether the northern portion of this continent can be developed without the aid of black labour, is one which requires a very intimate personal association with it. The suggestion put forward by the honorable member for Oxley yesterday, although it met with such energetic opposition, was a very good one indeed. Had I seen that there was the smallest chance of carrying it, I certainly should have given it my support, because I fail to see what harm could result from a delay of a few months. I appeal to those honorable members who are so strongly opposed to the slightest delay, to give a little consideration to the immense interests involved. </para>

                        <para>- These Japanese, Malays and others are in Queensland, and if they are not engaged in the sugar industry, what are they doing? There are a good few hundred of them engaged in the industry, and it is only fair to face the fact. From my own experience, I would rather have the kanakas to deal with a dozen times over than I would the Japanese, Malays and Chinese. Under the Pacific Island Labourers Act, if properly administered, we can to some extent control the branches of labour in which kanakas can compete with white men, but the other aliens, to whom I have referred, very soon monopolize all branches of business. I think that the extension of five years is too long, and I would suggest that the period be made two years. In the case of Western Australia, the Federal Convention allowed that State to retain its Customs duties for five years, with an annual reduction by 20 per cent. ; and surely it will not be contended that the Western Australian people are to be treated in a more liberal spirit than those of Queensland who have invested their money in a big industry natural to their soil and climate, Would Queensland have entered the Federation if she had known that the kanaka traffic was to be " squelched " in the manner proposed ? </para>

                        <para>- We know how frequently representatives are returned on election cries, but these cries are not reliable, a clever politician can make a because cry of anything. This cry for the abolition of black labour sounded very well to a number of people who, perhaps, did not reckon that in abolishing black labour, they were, in some districts, depriving white people of employment. If the honorable member for Oxley will so frame his amendment as to make an extension of two years, he may get considerable support from honorable members who are anxious for a " white Australia," but who are not inclined to go to extremes. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I should like to know. Honorable gentlemen must know that the amendment is absolutely useless, and, according to their statements, at the best, if carried, would only mean that the sugar industry will drag out an existence for nine years instead of for four years. As a matter of fact, however, the Queensland planters are prepared to subscribe £30,000 or £40,000 to fight this matter, and I warn the people of Australia that the passing of this measure will not settle the question. When the time comes for stopping recruiting, and deporting the islanders, the fight will be hotter than ever, and the planters will be supported by the big financial institutions. </para>

                        <para>- That is a slander upon them. There is not a more prosperous body of men connected with the agricultural industry in any part of Australia. The more reasonable among the planters are prepared to make an honest effort to grow cane with white labour, but the large capitalists and the financial institutions, which control a number of the bigger plantations, are the people we have to fear. They throw all possible obstacles in the way of the employment of white labour, by making the conditions unbearable, and the wages too low for white men. I consider the term provided for in the clause a reasonable one, and a fair compromise, taken in connexion with the duties on sugar, and the bonuses to the cane growers. If the planters make an honest effort to obtain white labour in the interval before the expiration of the time appointed for the cessation of recruiting, they will find no difficulty in obtaining as many white workers as they require. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The honorable member gives the whole position away. This is really a racial question. We all know that the kanaka is comparatively harmless, because he can be easily regulated. There are no international considerations to prevent his deportation, though such considerations may affect the deportation of other coloured aliens. Hitherto many Asiatics and other coloured aliens have come into the Commonwealth under that principle of international comity by which one nation gives the right of ingress and egress to the inhabitants of others. </para>

                        <para>- Not a minute. I have been waiting for this moment for many years, and I do not intend to let the present opportunity pass. Moreover, an election at the present time would not afford any real test of the feeling of the people, because the Government have been striking men off the roll by hundreds. As soon as we pass a Federal Electoral Bill we shall be quite ready to fight those who desire that the kanaka should be retained. The borders of Queensland have had their own way so long that they do not like to have all their plans upset. This Bill will give them the first rebuff that they have had for ten years, and now they are whining and crying for time. The honorable member for South Australia thought that he was playing a strong card when he told us that we have never explained how it was that the kanaka had become a declining factor in the sugar industry, whilst the production of sugar had doubled itself within a few years. </para>

                        <para>- They had discussed the matter. The Honorable Angus Gibson,, at one of the conferences which was held! not long since, made it clear that a Customs duty of£5 per ton upon sugar would be sufficient to enable the planters to pay the wages required by white men. The kanaka is not only employed upon the plantations of Queensland, but he is occupying leased lands in the district which I represent, and is growing sugar upon them. I know that there is an impression abroad that these people are confined under the State laws to certain occupations. But I would point out that they obtain their exemption tickets. We should be careful that we do not give citizen rights to those who are not competent to use them in the best interests of the country. All the arguments which have been advanced in favour of an extension of the period for recruiting purposes have been well and fully answered by the speech of the Prime Minister, who has conclusively shown that for years past the plea for more time has been continuously raised. I think that the Government are dealing very fairly with the planters of Queensland. I compliment the honorable member for Oxley upon having made a good fight, although I do not know that his constituents will be pleased with his action. If that honorable member had voiced the same opinion before his constituents as he has expressed in this House, I do not think he would have been elected. I know the Oxley electorate fairly well, and that is my opinion. I am aware that there is a strong democratic element in that district. My vote will be cast in favour of the Bill as it stands. If it were possible to still further restrict the period allowed for recruiting, I should vote in that direction also. </para>

                    <para>- I would still urge the Prime Minister to make some concession to meet the desire of those who are interested in this industry. I feel that there is no possibility of getting an extension of the term allowed for recruiting to 1909 ; but I do think that the Ministry should agree to some concession in order to overcome the difficulties which, so far as this particular industry is concerned, are patent to everybody. The honorable member for Darling Downs referred to the advances which have been made by the Queensland Government for carrying on the sugar industry by means of the erection of central mills, and stated that in making those advances it was intended to do away with black labour. That is perfectly true. It was provided that only cane grown by white labour should be crushed at these mills. But the Government themselves - as I stated when speaking upon the second reading of the Bill - had to withdraw from their position, and accept cane which had been grown by black labour, because it was otherwise impossible to get the quantity necessary to keep the mills supplied. That is sufficient to show that a trial has been given to the cultivation of sugar cane by white labour to the exclusion of black. The experiment has failed. The honorable member for Maranoa is always refreshing and forcible when he speaks. In fact I could almost fancy that he was addressing the Opposition in the Queensland Parliament with himself in the capacity of Premier. He laid down the law so very emphatically, and at the same time dealt with so much that was purely relative to the State of Queensland. But, although he is so intensely desirous of doing away with black labor, I am satisfied that he does not wish to do anything unfair to those who have invested large sums of money in the sugar industry. I feel also that there is a desire on the part of the labor party to face this matter fairly. All that is sought by the sugar-planters is an extension of the period for recruiting by two or three years. I understand that the honorable member for Oxley will presently ask leave to withdraw his amendment in order to move another, providing that the extension shall be for either two or three years. The question of a two years' extension is a very little one to those who desire a white Australia, but it means a great deal to those who have invested large sums in an industry which is of the greatest possible importance to Queensland. The honorable member for Kennedy has said that the planters urge that the abolition of black labour will ruin the sugar industry. Therefore, he argued, if the period allowed for recruiting were extended to 1909, the extinction of the industry would ensue at the expiration of that period. But that is not the argument which is put forward by the planters. When speaking upon the second reading of the Bill, the Prime Minister said that time had been granted because some machinery might be invented, or something might arise to compensate the planters for the abolition of black labour. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister said that he hoped something would arise to enable the sugar planters within a certain period to be compensated for the loss which they would sustain by reason of the discontinuance of the kanaka traffic. That is the reason further consideration is asked for. Circumstances may arise which will enable the planters to do without coloured labour, but I do not think that will be the case so far as Northern Queensland is concerned. Certainly the longer term we give the greater opportunity the planters will have of putting their house in order ; and I urge the Government to see what can be done towards granting some extension. Two years is not a very long period, and there should be no hesitation on the part of. either the labour party or the Government in accepting such an amendment. Lt.-Col. Reay, after his visit to Queensland, wrote a good deal on the subject of the sugar industry, and no doubt honorable members have read his pamphlet with considerable interest. The conclusions of Lt.-Col. Reay clearly show that further consideration is necessary. He says - </para>

                    <para>. - I think the proposal in the Bill is reasonable, and if that be the sense of the House, I do not see why the clause should be altered. I do not want to make a long speech, because I desire to see this Bill sent to the Senate as soon as possible. Certain specific dates are mentioned in its provisions, and it is important that the Bill should be passed into law before the1st January, otherwise amendments will have to be made in the dates in order to keep faith and adhere to the same specific periods. The honorable member for Oxley has charged me with not having kept faith with Queensland, but I am quite sure my conscience is clear on that point. At any stage of any of my speeches I never gave Queensland to understand that there would be any Bill except some such measure as this. It was impossible at that stage to say whether three, four, five, six, or seven years would be fixed by the Cabinet, who had not then agreed on the dates, and who must have known, as a Cabinet, that they had so to arrange dates as to command public approval. </para>

                <para class="block" pgwide="yes">Queensland put forward his manifesto, to the effect that a term of ten years would be sufficient - a term which will expire next year - there did not seem to be any who thought it was not a liberal offer to make. But in order that, if possible, the time might be shortened, and might not extend so long as ten years, the right honorable gentleman who was then Premier of Queensland said he would not put any term in the Bill, because that would go far to create vested interests. The Bill was therefore passed in the form suggested by the Premier, in order to prevent the creation of vested interests, yet an extension is now asked for largely on the ground that vested interests exist. I do not think that such a position is within reason. I admit that when we are dealing with an important industry we ought to give those engaged in it an opportunity of turning round and making other arrangements without unnecessary loss to themselves, and that is why the term of five years is fixed for agreements, and a little over two years for the purpose of licences. It must be recollected that in Queensland there is a force of something like 9, 000 kanakas available for employment until the expiration of the period named in the Bill. I do not admit that Queensland is asking for a further extension than that which this Bill proposes to grant. Queensland does not ask for an extension, as the Federal elections showed beyond all doubt. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is entitled to his opinion, as I am entitled to mine ; but I venture to say that the result of the Federal elections, so far as elections can prove anything, proves the fact that probably seven-ninths of the population of Queensland are in favour of the termination of this traffic in a reasonably short time ; and " a reasonably short term of years" were the very words I used. If the elections show what I have indicated, I do not think it would be fair to the electors to make the term unduly long. We know that there are a number of honorable members in the House who would gladly vote for the instant abolition of the traffic, and who are taking a moderate and reasonable course, from their point of view, in supporting the proposals of the Bill. We know also that extensions of time have been proposed and carried from time to time, sometimes by those who, there was reason to expect, would support further extensions when the time came. Looking at the matter from that point of view, I think we have done fairly and reasonably by providing the time mentioned in this clause and in the other clause dealing with the licences. There are those who say that the industry can never be carried on without black labour, and yet, when these people are making a request for something other than this Bill, they point to five, seven, or ten years - I dare say some would like it to be 100 years - as a reasonable period to allow. </para>

From their position, this would seem rather a case for a straight-out fight between those who say that black labour is indispensable, and those who say that it is not. I do not wish to dwell on that point, but only to urge that I think we are acting fairly and reasonably in this clause, and, therefore, are not called upon to accept the amendment. I should like to say a word on the question which has been raised concerning New Guinea. I do not want to anticipate the debate on the motion of which notice has been given ; but if New Guinea is taken over, and becomes a territory of the Commonwealth, a resolution carried by us would merely be a justification by Parliament of the intermediate administrative Action by the Government. The matter of New Guinea cannot be finally settled without an Act of Parliament, or, perhaps, more than one Act, in which all questions of this kind can, and will be, strictly defined. We have not yet taken over New Guinea, and I do not think we need complicate the discussion by references to that subject. The Government's policy in regard to New Guinea will, I think, be appreciated by those who have followed what the Government are doing in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- That is a question which need not trouble us now, because, in a Bill dealing with New Guinea, we shall have to pay attention specifically to that question. As to the appointment of a Royal commission, which has been so much spoken of, I agree with the argument used by the honorable member for Maranoa, namely, that public opinion has shown clearly what its direction is. Public opinion, in Queensland particularly, has proved that no Royal commission is expected by the majority of the people of that State. There are before this House reports, pamphlets, and every other kind of information to a greater extent than was ever before the Queensland Parliament when this question was dealt with. There has not been shown throughout the debate one reason for expecting that facts, which are not already in printed documents, will be discovered by any such inquiry. If that cannot be shown, then I think there is no case for a Royal commission. It is absurd to say, as some honorable members have said, that I have boasted of an inordinate degree of knowledge on this subject. I claim no knowledge on this or any other subject, but this Parliament has the means of obtaining knowledge in a greater degree than any Parliament which has previously dealt with the question. The time is ripe for action, and I see no reason to depart from the provision in the clause. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so. All that the honorable member for Oxley asks is that the period during which island labourers may be imported shall be extended from 1904 to 1909. I should like to point out that if this clause is not altered it will be very difficult to amend clause6, which says that after 1901 kanakas shall be imported only according to a certain scale. Clause 3, as it stands in the Bill, is utterly misleading. It makes it appear that kanaka labourers may be imported up to 1904, whereas under clause 6 it is provided that during 1902 the number imported shall not exceed three-fourths of the number who have been returned in 1901, while in 1903 the number to be imported is to be reduced to not more than one-half of the number who have been returned during the previous year. We shall not have done with this question when we pass this clause. There are still a large number of steps in the procedure which must be observed in getting the Bill through, and honorable members who are anxious to see it passed will not do well to prolong the debate by being too stiff-necked. No doubt a certain section of the committee have the Government fairly under the whip. Were it not so, the discussion of the Tariff, which is a matter of vital interest to every commercial man in the States, would not have been postponed to enable this Bill to be brought forward. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister placed the proposed duty upon sugar and the departure of the kanaka so closely together that it is difficult to separate the two questions. No doubt honorable members who oppose the amendment have a right to be keen in the views they advocate, because they have a substantial majority behind them, but they should not try to press their victory too far, lest it turn into a defeat. I am just as thorough upon the question of freeing Australia from all kinds of black labour as any member of this House, and I was so some years before the honorable member for Wide Bay ever thought of the subject. I started sixteen years ago in Northern Australia to fight against the introduction of aliens, and I have travelled through the States in opposition to it. I will put my record in this respect against that of any other man in Australia. I am not trying to shelve the question now, but I am of opinion that it will do no harm to accede to the proposal of the honorable member for Oxley. The alien invasion which first threatened Northern Australia was the invasion of Chinese and Japanese, who were a terror, not so much to the labouring man in Queensland, as to the trading population and the artisans. </para>

If the views held by the majority of the representatives of Queensland in this House are any guide, the people in that State are entirely favorable to the proposals of the Government, and no reason has been advanced which would justify us in voting against them. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to the attitude of the leader of the Opposition- which he seemed to consider was not sufficiently firm - on this question of black labour. Whatever the leader of the Opposition may have done, he certainly did not succeed in securing the support of the pro-kanaka party and the anti-kanaka party at the same time. That is the answer to the Prime Minister, who talks about the tergiversation of other people. </para>

Nevertheless, I think that his proposal is covered by my reply upon an earlier occasion, that we believe the date fixed is really reasonable. </para>

We do not think that the Commonwealth Government in the limited period during which recruiting may be carried on, should interfere with the administration of the law, but that the Queensland authorities should administer it. We have every confidence that it will be honestly administered by them. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion this is the most doubtful of all the clauses in the Bill. I have the greatest anxiety upon the question of whether it is desirable to deport these Pacific Islanders at all. The weight of the evidence, however, is in favour of the lines laid down by the Prime Minister, and accordingly I am prepared to support the Bill. In answer to the objection which has been raised by the honorable and learned member for Corio, I may say that if the State Parliament is to administer this Act, it will be administered very leniently. Personally, I shall not offer any opposition to a lenient administration of this provision, because there are many instances in Queensland where kanakas have made certain arrangements which it would not be humane to disturb. I would not do an injustice to any race, much less to a race many of whom have been compelled to come to Australia. I feel strongly upon this matter of deportation ; it seems to me we are straining our powers to the very utmost. I support the clause as it stands. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to know how the Ministry think this clause is to be carried out. Who is to deport these Pacific Islanders upon the order of the court? Is it to be deportation by the local executive or by the person who has entered into an agreement with a particular kanaka and who is brought before a court of summary jurisdiction? Is the old employer or is the Commonwealth to deport? There is a declaration of principle in this clause without any machinery being provided for the carrying out of that principle. We cannot ask a court to determine what the Commonwealth Parliament had in its mind from such vague terms as are contained in this clause. I do not know whether the Prime Minister thinks that under the regulations a particular method can be provided. The Bill itself is silent upon the point. </para>

                    <para>. - It will be within the recollection of honorable members that this Bill was passed through committee with the exception of clauses 44 to 48 inclusive, which were postponed because of a difficulty which arose mainly in connexion with clause 45. That is the clause which provides for the method of payment for the properties already taken over by the Commonwealth from the various States. A suggestion was then made that the conference of Premiers should be held, and a conference has since taken place at the invitation of the Prime Minister. </para>

                <para>Owing to differences of opinion amongst the Premiers, it is not intended at present, pending further consideration, to deal with the question of the method of payment for the properties already taken over. In the meantime, some action may possibly be taken towards getting a valuation of those properties, and when it is decided what the actual amount is, further steps will be taken towards a settlement. The figures which were given under certain circumstances, three or four years ago, are acknowledged to be fictitious. </para>

                        <para>- Means will probably be adopted to get a valuation of the properties, and when that is done, the question as to the method of payment will have to be specially considered. I want it to be understood that the Government do not abandon their position regarding the method of payment. Nearly every one who has expressed an opinion in my hearing, including some of the Premiers, believes that it will amount to the same thing ultimately, whether the arrangement be as proposed, or some other method be adopted to satisfy the States. By the amendments which I am about to propose, I do not wish it to be understood that the Government have receded from their position, but that it is in deference to the wishes of the Premiers that the consideration of the method of payment is postponed. The postponement can cause no inconvenience, because, as will be seen, clause 45 is not mandatory, but simply permissive, merely providing that action may be taken if no agreement is completed. In my opinion the valuations will take many months to complete, because all will have to be made by one set of men. </para>

                        <para>- But no difficulty will arise in consequence of the postponement. If no agreement be made with the various States, the question will be submitted to the House. It is not proposed to amend clause 44, because that clause does not take effect as applying to properties which have been taken over automatically by the Commonwealth, but it is proposed to amend clause 46, by amalgamating it with the next clause. None of the Premiers object to the course which I propose to take. </para>

                        <para>- It is not intended to act harshly towards the States. The object of the Government will be to make an arrangement with them both as to the method of compensation - whether by cash, or by the taking over of liabilities, or by the giving of securities - or as to the amount of the debts to be taken over. A large sum of money - probably £8,000,000 or £10,000,000 or more- will have to be paid for the properties already taken over ; but the arrangements to be made in connexion with that property will not be affected by this clause. The clause will chiefly affect smaller properties that may be required by the Commonwealth after the Bill is passed; nothing in this Act will affect the properties already the property of the </para>

                        <para>- I think the Minister for Home Affairs understood that the principle was accepted already. As the clause stands, it will have a compulsory effect. I do not think power exists under the Constitution to compel the States to accept this mode of payment, and it cannot, therefore, be vested in the Commonwealth by Act of Parliament. Inasmuch as by compulsion we can only take over the debts per head of the population, under what authority can we force the States to accept payment by the assumption of their debts, if they do not agree? </para>

My own opinion is that it can, but I admit that the opposite opinion might well be defended, although I do not think it is necessary to attack it at this time. If the contention of the honorable and learned member is correct, this provision is surplusage ; whereas if my contention is correct, the power sought to be conferred may prove a valuable one. </para>

To alter it here would necessitate amendments elsewhere, and, although it may not perhaps be quite elegant, it might, under the circumstances, be allowed to remain. </para>

                        <para>- I understand clause 44 relates to land which was not used for departmental purposes at the time of the passing of this Act, but which was acquired afterwards. Under these circumstances I do not see how section 85, sub-section (3), of the Constitution can apply, because that relates only to lands which were departmental lands at the time of the taking over of the departments by the Commonwealth. Still I do not think the Government will have any difficulty in justifying this clause, inasmuch as they have power to acquire land for the purposes of their departments hereafter. The only difficulty I should have is as to whether we could as buyers make our own arrangements as to the currency in which we shall pay. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it is obvious that a payment in some Mexican money at a certain ratio would not answer the purpose. Instead of paying cash for lands acquired, we simply say that we will give an equivalent in the shape of taking over a part of the public debt of the State. Of course there is nothing unjust in that, but although I do not see the same difficulty as others, I do not justify this clause under section 85. </para>

                        <para>- It was the result of second thoughts on the part of the Government. After the Bill had been passed through the Senate, and had been submitted to this House, it was withdrawn from us, and submitted to the conference of Premiers. Now we find that the Premiers are not satisfied, and we cannot get any representative of the Government to assure us positively, without any reservation or quibble, that the Premiers approve of this clause. I am inclined to think that the Premiers do not agree to the provisions of this clause. Judging from the statements made by the Premier of South Australia, no proper agreement has been arrived at, and honorable members should not be asked to consider the Bill under such conditions. We know that the Premiers have not come to any conclusion. If what the South Australian Premier says is to be credited the whole of this consultation has been absolutely valueless, and we should have been as well off if we had proceeded with the discussion of the details of the Bill without consulting the State Premiers at all. I do not know how far the Premiers are in agreement with clause 44. In the amendments which have just been put before us by the Government it is proposed to omit clauses 45 and 47, and to pass clause 46" with an addition. All these are matters of importance, and the Bill itself, so far as the rights of the various States are concerned, is one of the most important with which we have had to deal. It excited a tremendous lot of comment and discussion in another branch of the Legislature. It has also excited much debate in the various State ' Parliaments, and yet to-day we have no evidence that there is a single State Premier who is satisfied with if. I ask the Attorney-General if the Premier of Victoria is satisfied with clause 44 1 </para>

I understand that, as a matter of courtesy, and in answer to representations made by the . State Premiers, this Bill was held over till a conference of those gentlemen could be held, at which also the Federal Government would be represented, the idea being that the latter could subsequently advise this House if, in their opinion, any amendment of this measure was deemed to be necessary. I understand that, in the amendments which have been placed before us, we have the results of that conference. </para>

                        <para>- I can see only what is contained in the amendments, and it certainly looks very like it. The amendment proposed to clause 46 takes out of the purview of the Act any land vested in the Commonwealth before the commencement of this Act in regard to claims for compensation, the determination of such compensation, and the mode in which it shall be paid. All lands vested under section 85 of the Constitution are not affected by this Bill at all. Clause 47a, which is a new clause, provides that where no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation to a State for the value of any property vested in or acquired by the Commonwealth under section 85 of the Constitution - which applies to land vested in departments transferred to the Commonwealth - the Governor-General may re-invest such property in the State. </para>

                    <para>- When the previous clause was under discussion, I incidentally referred to this clause. If the State Premiers will not accept this alternative method of paying for property, do the Government propose to compel them to do so by Act of Parliament? I am thoroughly in accord with the Government method of paying for the properties which have been acquired by the Commonwealth. I believe in the policy of it, and in the policy of clause 44, not only with regard to property acquired under this Act, but as an alternative method of discharging obligations taken over under the Constitution. I believe in the Commonwealth taking over from the various States a proportion of their public indebtedness equivalent to the value of the properties acquired. I moved in that direction in the Federal Convention, but was unsuccessful. I understand it is the intention of the Government, irrespective of whether the States agree to this alternative method of payment, to introduce a Bill- </para>

                        <para>- But if the. Government fail to get this method adopted by agreement, I do not understand where the power of compelling the States to adopt it is derived from. The clause proposes to deduct from the total amount of the compensation payable to the States the amount which the States would be liable to contribute per head of the population. If the amount to be paid to South Australia for the properties taken over under the Constitution were £1,500,000, the Government propose to deduct its share per head of the population. If the total were £10,500,000, and the compensation £1,500,000, the share of South Australia would be £1,000,000, which she would have to contribute. The Government- propose to deduct from the total compensation of £1,500,000 the sum of £1,000,000, that being, per head of population, the quota of South Australia. The inherent weakness of the proposition of the Government is that it deals with compensation moneys payable to the States - that is, credits due to the States - as if that compensation or credit were revenues collected under the Constitution Act. That is the fundamental weakness in the Government's proposition from a constitutional point of view. Section 89 of the Commonwealth Constitution declares that until the imposition of uniform duties of Customs the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected in the State by the Commonwealth, and that the Commonwealth shall debit to each State the expenditure for maintenance, and the proportion of the State, according to the number of the people, in the other expenditure of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that we cannot if the property is once vested in the Commonwealth. The only way in which that is provided for in a case of this kind is by compensation. Anybody who reads subsection (3) of section 85 of the Constitution will see that the compensation must be in some other form of value - it must be value and not the land itself which is given in compensation. To return the land as compensation is an attempt to give the Governor-General a power which is contrary to the powers forced on the Commonwealth by section 85. </para>

The only fear I had when the honorable and learned member was dwelling upon the history of the operation of the. preferential rates on the railways was that some honorable members, or perhaps the public, might consider that the real point in dispute was whether or not the war of railway rates existed, and not whether the particular mode of putting an end to that war which was suggested by the Government was necessary, or would, if adopted, be: likely to prove efficacious. </para>

                            <para>- I will deal with that presently. I first wish to refer to the possibilities of unfair competition in the case of the railways of the German Empire. They have empire railways, State railways, private railways under State administration, independent railways, and railways let on lease by the Government. So that there is great diversity of machinery at all events, and from the fact of there being State railways, Imperial railways, and private railways, all engaged in competition in regard to certain lines of traffic, there is a possibility of a greater clashing of interests than that which has led, in the case of our State railways to the evil of preferential rates. What appears to have been done in Germany was to create an Imperial board to act in conjunction with a number of provincial railway boards, which are helped by district committees . The members of these committees are elected by representatives of commerce, agriculture, and forestry. They do not control, but they suggest chiefly. The boards do not control the rates except as far as may be necessary to secure low long-distance rates, or to secure as far as possible uniformity of management. There is no attempt to fix rates, except as far as the rates do not cany out the mandate of the Constitution that there shall be low long-distance rates, and as far as possible uniformity of management. The German Constitution- - articles 42 and 46 - provides for uniformity of management of the railways as one system, for uniformity of regulations, and for long-distance rates for all agricultural and mineral produce. </para>

It is illegal under the Constitution, and is declared to be illegal under the common law in America. Whether we create a commission or not, this differentiation, after the Tariff is passed, if not now after its introduction, can be put an end to, it can be terminated as soon as challenged, because the Constitution declares such preferences to be illegal. As to the comparative triviality Of this matter, might I point out that in the United States they seem to have got on pretty well down to 1887 without any special machinery.

                            <para>- Undoubtedly that was done : but I am simply speaking of a particular class of boycotting in America and which cannot exist here. My object is to show that conditions which justified the creation of an Inter-State Commission in America do not, to the same extent at all events, exist here. One of those conditions in America is that railway companies are producers competing with companies which are not owners of railways. The railway companies boycotted the competing mine owners - owners of coal and other mines - and this led to very serious evils which required parliamentary check. To put an end to that state of things, the InterState Commission was created in 1S87. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing of that kind exists in Australia., where we have no railway companies which are mine-owners, and private carriers have no interest in boycotting or giving preference to one State as against another. The conditions are not at all analogous as between the United States and the Commonwealth of Australia. In regard to the powers conferred on the commission, we find that in the United States, notwithstanding the far greater justification that existed for the creation of a body of the kind, the powers given were not nearly so great as those proposed under the Bill. The powers in America are limited to any traffic by rail, or rail and water under one common management. In the Bill before us, power is given to deal with rates, whether the traffic is under one common management or not, or whether there is through traffic by rail and water, except so far as the new amendments may modify the provision as to water-carriage. At any rate, the Bill at present gives power to deal with water rates, although the water carriage is not part of one general transhipment charge made by railway companies. So far as the power of interfering with private individuals is concerned, there is no power given in America except as to railway companies, and railway companies which have another mode of carriage in connexion with their lines. Generally speaking, private carriers, not railway companies, do not come within the scope of the commission. </para>

                            <para>- Some of the best authorities deny the expediency of giving such a. power, and I shall endeavour to show that there is justification for refusing the power to the commission. Inter-State Commissions, like all public bodies, clamour for more power, in the same way that Parliament always desires to extend its powers. One of the future difficulties of this federation will arise from the imposition of a check by the States on probable attempts by the Federal Government to arrogate to itself more powers. All parliamentary and administrative bodies have, perhaps, too high an idea of their own significance, and are remarkable for their attempts to promote their own aggrandizement. It is, therefore, not surprising that in America the Inter-State Commission has from time to time endeavoured to extend its powers, although, happily, up to the present, Parliament has denied applications for this extension. In 1886 a committee of the American Senate reported on a suggestion that the proposed commission should be given power to fix rates. </para>

                            <para>- These high rates are a great evil still. Perhaps the Board of Trade has not sufficiently ample powers, or they may be neglecting the exercise of those powers in the same way that the American commission is alleged to have neglected its powers. At any rate, the railway rates are burdensome still. What I wish to point out, however, is that it was the existence of preferential rates, against the local producers, and operating in favour of the importers, that led to the creation of a body in England in 1888 analagous to the Inter-State Commission which it is now sought to bring into existence here. The charges for coal were shown to be double the German rates, and double the Belgian rates, for an equal distance. A railway authority, Mr. Jeans, , who gave evidence before the commission, pointed out that the rates for the carriage of iron were 58 per cent. higher than those charged in France, and 80 per cent. higher than those in Germany ; and that in many cases through rates were refused by the competing companies. Besides that, the railway companies were beginning to buy up the canals, and it was found that as soon as a railway company became the owner of the canal it increased the rates in order to divert most of the traffic to the railways. </para>

These were the pressing evils which existed in England, and which justified the creation of a body, with the powers that are given under the English Act, and which are, to some extent, copied in our proposed local legislation. Under the English Act, however, there is no power given over purely coastal and sea traffic, and no powers over private carriers other than canal and railway companies - powers which are proposed to be vested by the Bill in the Inter-State Commission. I think ' I have shown honorable members enough to make them hesitate before they copy the legislation of the United Kingdom or the United States in this matter. We are asked, not only to copy the legislation in those countries, but to extend it, although the evils in both the United Kingdom and in the United States were far more pressing than they are here. I had intended to analyze the Bill; but I am not in a position to do itat this stage without looking through my notes. I desire, how to say a few words in regard to the Constitution.

                            <para>- I believe it would be. Why do I say it would be? Because the courts can take cognisance of breaches of the spirit as well as of the letter of the Constitution. They have to rely upon the common law for redress in connexion with breaches of the Constitution in America, and when the commission was appointed in 1886 the desire, as expressed by the report of the committee of the Senate, was not to secure something which the common law did not to a great extent supply, but an amplification of the common law powers and machinery to carry out the implied powers of the Constitution. After we have adopted our Tariff, and InterState free-trade has been established, it will be competent for any State or individual who is affected by preferential rates to challenge them in the courts of justice. I believe that, pending the creation of a federal tribunal, a State Court can pronounce upon the invalidity of preferential rates. </para>

The observation that the State courts might do this was not necessary to my argument, because if we have to create a Federal court, we can do so at any moment. The point I insisted upon was that an individual or a State could apply to some court to compel respect of the provisions of the Constitution in relation to InterState freedom of trade, without the intervention of an Inter-State Commission. So far as railway rates attempt to neutralize those provisions, they are invalid under the Constitution. To some extent the creation of a commission of this sort may hamper litigants. As to the point of the existence of common law rights, I might mention that there is adequate power to control these preferential rates. Section 102 of the Constitution, according to a fairly well-founded interpretation, requires the creation of an an Inter-State Commission only as the basis of Federal legislation to control preferential rates on railways. If honorable members will look at section 102 they will find that - </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I remember deploring this section in the Convention. It seemed to me to put behind what should be in front. The reading of the section, which I believe is possible, if not probable, is that before Parliament can pass a law in relation to these rates we must create a commission to. declare them bad. Here is an allegation that it is a condition precedent to the passing of such legislation that a special tribunals hall be created to declare those rates bad. That forms the basis of the legislative power. It is an absurd position in which to be placed, but that is a probable interpretation of the section: So far as there may be necessity to create a commission; that necessity only exists, for the purpose of this section, to justify legislation. I repeat that without legislation the Constitution declares such rates to be invalid. If we neglect to create an Inter-State Commission we still have remedies which will be adequate against the continance of those special rates. But when we begin to legislate in regard to them we require a commission, under section 102, to justify that legislation. I think that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo will agree with me that if that section were not in the Constitution it would not be necessary to create a commission. At all events, it would not be necessary for us to do more than nominally appoint a commission so as to fulfil the requirements of section 101 of the Constitution which says that there shall be an Inter-State Commission. I do not think I will deal any further with the particular clauses of the Bill. I have suggested in some amendments which are before honorable members that it would be better to create a commission composed of such of the railway commissioners of the several States as are permitted to act. I am acting upon the suggestion thrown out by the reports to which I have referred, as the result of the agreement at which the railway commissioners unanimously arrived in 1895, when I say that if we give power to the railway commissioners to end this war of rates it will be done. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. If we appointed the railway commissioners of the different States as the tribunal, under the terms of this Bill, the war of rates would be abolished. If this is not done, another suggestion which is contained in my amendments, is that the power of the commission should be limited to rates charged on the railways, or at all events to rates on railways or railways and other modes of conveyance used and controlled by the railway of the States for the purpose of completing the carriage of goods entrusted to them. The commission should not be given power over private carriers in regard to water or land rates; but wherever the rail way authorities have imposedpre- perennial rates and are using and controlling water carriage for the balance of the distance over which they carry the goods, the commission might have power to interfere. That is not a preference, but an alternative suggestion; What interests would prompt a private carrier, by water or by land, to help a particular State ? Has that patriot yet been found who is prepared to sacrifice questions of pounds, shillings, and pence to the corporate advancement of a particular State? Have honorable members ever met a private carrier who is willing to reduce his rates in order to benefit one particular portion of his State as against a particular portion of another State? I have not done so, nor have I conceived the existence of such an individual. What self interests could prompt private carriers, by sea or by land, to impose preperennial or differential rates of the character imposed hitherto by the Railway Commissioners ? </para>

                            <para>- Could the commission put an end to that until the discovery of it? But the moment the fact leaked out that a private carrier was receiving secret rebates the courts could put a stop to the practice. We do not require a commission to discover it. We are asked to create a commission to declare the rates bad. The commission would declare that they were opposed to the spirit of the Constitution, but three Judges would be probably as wise as the commission. I do not suppose that it is intended to pay the members of the commission £7,000 or £10,000 a year in order to secure the best railway managers from England. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. It is generally a private individual who puts the commission on the scent. The private individual complains, but he cannot complain of an evil the existence of which he does not know. When he discovers it, he can point it out to the court. I cannot see why, even from the point of view of the private individual, whose interest it is to make the discovery, we should place private carriers within the scope of the Inter-State Commission. Such a proposal was never contemplated by the convention, and should not have been placed in this Bill. If I remember rightly, the honorable and learned member for Bendigo referred to certain rates by water, which showed a preference in favour of Sydney as against Brisbane on the through charges between Sydney and Brisbane and some Northern port. </para>

It is that class of rates to which the honorable and learned member referred. </para>

                            <para>- I have some notes explaining the reason, but I will not read them now. The commission could not interfere with them, because they are reductions due to the fact that the shipping companies think it more economical to have direct carriage between certain ports than carriage involving transhipments between the ports. There are two handlings of the goods in one case, and only one in the other. There is nothing unjust in the system, and nothing in it with which the commission should be asked to interfere. I thank honorable members for their patient hearing of my remarks, which in the circumstances have been necessarily somewhat discursive. In committee I shall endeavour to limit the powers of the commission, at all events to the measure given in the United States, and to prevent interference with private carriers. I hope the suggestion which I have made, that we should endeavour to induce the States to come to an amicable arrangement to put an end to these special rates, will be carried out. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has circulated an amendment to postpone the operation of this Bill for six months, with a view of enabling the Government to call the attention of the States to the powers of the Federation. That amendment, I think, should be adopted. The States themselves could arrive at an agreement, which would not only put an end to differential rates, but save us from the expense of this tribunal and from unnecessary machinery, which would prove harassing. The simpler our machinery is the better, and a thing that is proved to be unnecessary should not be created. </para>

                            <para>- I go with the honorable and learned member so far as to say that there is nothing so likely to make the people hate Government interference or to put back the hand of the clock with regard to Government control as ill-advised or unnecessary Government control - Government control which has not been well thought out and which the people do not require. I feel strongly that there is no need for the immediate creation of this court. I am aware that the Constitution provides that there shall be an Inter-State Commission, but fortunately it does not say that it shall be appointed within a particular time. I do not know how other honorable members find the current of .public opinion, but my experience is that in the present stage of transition there is a great . deal of uneasiness with regard to the finances of the different States. If it be possible to allay that uneasiness, to assuage that anxiety, and to postpone the creation of an expensive tribunal such as is here contemplated, I think that we ought to do it. I admit that if we could not get on without an Inter-State Commission we should be bound to create it. But I think we can. I venture to say that if this InterState commission is created it will be found to have little or no work to do for many years. </para>

                            <para>- That is just the point to which I was coming. I want to say first, however, that it is not obligatory to create this commission within one or two years. If the House thinks it is not essential to create this expensive court at once, that its establishment should be postponed until the ship of State has steadied itself a bit, and until people know where they are and where the finances are, there is nothing to prevent us deferring legislative action. I am willing to submit to a great many inconveniences at this stage of our national life, in order that we may give the public, and the State Treasurers an opportunity of seeing where they stand. There are railway rates, I admit, which are cutting rates, and which are most injurious to the public interest. Most of these injurious rates could not be touched by the Inter-State Commission at all. If people have to pay a lower rate for cargo from Sydney to Rockhampton than from Sydney to Brisbane, I say, without any hesitation, that that rate cannot be touched by the Inter-State Commission. I say, further, that if there is a lower rate for traffic from Sydney to Hay than obtains from Sydney to Cootamundra, which is the shorter distance, that long haulage rate cannot be touched in the slightest degree. It was intended to be touched, but it is not touched. There is no doubt that the railways are the chief carriers in Australia. If one looks at section 102 of the Constitution, it will be found that the only rates which can be prohibited upon the railways are what are called " preferences, " or " discriminations." If I charge all persons the same rate for all goods between the same termini there is no preference and no discrimination, but there is a preference or discrimination if I charge men a different rate, according to the place from which they bring their goods. I will give honorable members an instance or two, as it is always best to put a concrete case. Upon our Victorian railways for example, it has been the practice to charge £4 7s. lOd. per ton for the carriage of goods from Melbourne to Echuca. What is the corresponding rate for the same goods from Melbourne to Echuca, if these goods are intended to go to Bourke or Nyngan ? It is £1 2s. Gd. per ton. That is a preferential rate indeed. </para>

                            <para>- It must give a preference or discrimination first of all. I think that sort of thing would be regarded as unjust or unreasonable. Concerning the differential rates, the position is very different. Supposing, for example, that in order to attract trade to and from Sydney and Moama or Albury, there was a low rate charged for the long haul. That would not be discrimination or preference at all because all persons who went to the same station would be treated alike, and the same rate would be applicable to the goods. Unfortunately, therefore, in section 102 of the Constitution there is no power to interfere with differential rates. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it would. If one reads section 102 one finds that it is specific with regard to the railways, and it would be meaningless if we were to apply any general power to it for the regulation of trade and commerce. There was a tremendous amount of debate in the convention with regard to the development of territory, and as to financial responsibilities - debate upon quite a subsidiary and minor matter. I did my best to point out that preferences or discriminations would not cover differential rates. </para>

                            <para>- I have looked at the adjudications concerning this matter in the American courts. There, they do not treat as discrimination a low rate for a long haul. We must give advantages to the dwellers in the back blocks, if they are to be the producers of goods. The result is that in America they have two distinct terms. They speak of a " low rate " for a long haul as a differential rate, and of a rate which is different according to a source or the distinction. So the rate from Melbourne to Bourke would be regarded as a preferential rate, because it prefers the Bourke producer to the Echuca producer. It prefers goods travelling to Bourke to those travelling to Echuca and stopping there. These preferential rates, however, cannot be treated as such, so as to be interfered with, unless the Inter-State Commission adjudicate that they are preferential and unjust. This is the only argument in favour of the creation of the InterState Commission. I do not know what has happened since October the 8th, which was the date upon which Inter-State free-trade was supposed to have been established. </para>

                    <para>Mr.HIGGINS.- It would all depend upon circumstances. It would depend upon where the goods were going ultimately, and upon what was the motive. In the case stated by the honorable member the goods are probably intended to go beyond Serviceton. Are the goods meant to go beyond Dimboola? We cannot answer a question of that sort without knowing all the factors, and as to what is the final goal of the goods. I should call it a preferential rate if one man were charged a lower rate than another for sending an exactly similar kind of package from Servicetown to Dimboola. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt there will be a big staff of officials, and a building will have to be provided, in which to deposit the archives. I am sorry that this InterState Commission has been adopted in imitation of the United States' example. This is one of the evils of the spirit of pedantry which has haunted the making of our Constitution from first to last. We found that there was an Inter-State Commission in the United States, and, therefore, as we were forming a federation, we must have an Inter-State Commission in Australia. The circumstances in the two countries are altogether different. In the United States they had to deal with very grave conditions. There were private railways, infinitely ramified, which had to be kept in some sort of control for the public interest, whereas in Australia we have State railways and practically no others. In the United States they have magnificent rivers like the Mississippi, while here we have no Inter-State rivers worth speaking of for the purposes of navigation. The only river of the kind is the Murray, with its tributaries, and they are dry half the year. The unfortunate thing is that we have foisted on Australia an Inter-State Commission, which, so far as I can see, is not at all essential. I should much prefer to see our railways and our rivers under national control. </para>

The public mind is ripening to the feeling that we have hedged round the Federal Parliament's powers too rigidly. There is no doubt that there are several matters which experience will show can be much better dealt with in a national spirit by a national Parliament It may be asked - " Who is to look after the enforcement of the section of the Constitution which provides that there shall be free-trade between the States?" We are supposed at the present moment, and I hope it is true, to have free-trade between the States, and if any authority, say in Victoria, attempted by means of wharfage regulations, for instance, to prevent New South Wales goods from coming in, the attempt would be illegal. Section 92 of the Constitution provides - </para>

                            <para>- It may do that, but freedom of trade between the States is a matter which can be dealt with by the ordinary courts. The only matter in which an Inter-State Commission is essential is that of preferences and discriminations. In the United States there have from time to time been actions brought by people who have been charged wrongly, and who have recovered the amounts thus paid ; and I see no reason why we should not get on well enough without an Inter-State Commission in Australia. It may be urged that it is not fair to impose on a private person the expense of proving that there has been an infringement of the Constitution. No doubt that is so, but if we had an InterState Commission, the same thing would occur, because the commission is a court of record, and it will not move until it is put in motion. We shall have litigants appearing before this new kind of court with all the attendant expense, and I see there is provision for lawyers appearing. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that. In addition to litigation by private persons, we shall have litigation by public bodies, and I think that is a distinct advantage. All the clauses of the Bill show that the idea is to have the commission regarded as a court in all respects. Clause 23 provides that, if there be any objection to a rate charged, the objection must be put into writing and submitted to the commissioners, and by clause 24 the commission is made a court of record. By subsequent clauses the commission is given jurisdiction to hear and determine complaints and disputes, and we see that a State, the Commonwealth, a borough, or any other public body may bring matters before the court. All this shows that the commission has to be moved by some one ; and we could not expect three men, who have to deal with all Australia, to devote their whole time to fossicking out grounds of complaint throughout the Commonwealth. If they have any work at all, they will have quite enough to do to hear and determine the cases brought before them. I see that clause 32 actually incorporates, in connexion with the commission, some of the sections of the Supreme Court Act. Clause 33 gives the commission power to award damages, and by clause 39 an order made by the commissioners may be made a rule of court. What I desire to point out is that the two chief matters with which an Inter-State Commission could deal can be practically dealt with without a commission. These matters are free-trade as between the States, and preferences and discriminations. The question of free-trade can be dealt with by the ordinary courts, and preferences and discriminations will, I have no doubt, so far as regards railways, be adjusted by the Railways Commissioners. If the commissioners do not put the matter right, all we need do is to appoint three Railway Commissioners as an Inter-State Commission, and increase their salaries to a small extent, when I have no doubt that they will find an hour or half-an-hour's sitting per month quite enough for the work. I do not propose to go into the details of the clauses on the second reading. I see, however, an attempt to drag the differential rates under the control of the commission, just as if we could add to the Constitution. If we look at clause 15, we see it provided that all rates fixed by a common carrier for service rendered in respect of external or Inter-State commerce must be reasonable and just, and " every such rate which is unreasonable or unjust is hereby prohibited. In clause 21, which may be described as containing the long haulage provisions, we have a most interesting instance of the way in which the framers of this Bill have been puzzled how to provide that the differential rates should be treated as if they were preferential. </para>

With regard to the proposed regulation of the rates charged by water carriers and others, , I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not sympathize in the slightest with the cry against Government regulation, where it seems to he wise ; and where it seems to be justified by experience. The more we can secure the public interest under the control of Parliament the better, but I would deprecate any sudden invasion of the domain of private enterprise in cases where there are no real complaints. To rush in and interfere with industries which are fairly well carried on before we know whether we can make them better, would be calculated to bring our legislation into contempt.

If unfair charges were being levied in any particular case, and evidence were produced to that effect, I would not scruple to give the power required, but I prefer to wait until necessity arises. The provision in clause 45 to the effect that the commission shall make a report to Parliament is of no great importance. Clause 46 provides that there shall be a publication of rates, and that no advance shall be made in any rates except after ten days public notice I would ask whether that is advisable, having regard to our circumstances?

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear that the matter has come under the notice of the Attorney-General. I understand that, owing to the peculiar nature of the river, changes in the rates have to be made at very short notice when freshest come and permit of navigation and the transit of goods to a limited extent. If a river carrier finds that a freshet in the river will permit of his sending one boat instead of perhaps three, he has to charge special rates, and to take advantage of every moment of time that the river is navigable. I have very grave doubt as to whether clause 54 is in accordance with the Constitution, in so far as it proposes to enable the commission to exercise its power through one commissioner. The Constitution provides that the commission may do certain things, but I do not think that any Act we may pass would enable any one commissioner to perform the functions of the commission as a whole. I doubt also whether clause 41, which provides for appeals, is constitutional. In sub-section (4) power is given to the High Court to make any order that the commission might have made. Clause 35 also contains a provision which I think very objectionable. It provides that every finding of fact made by the commission in respect of any complaint shall, in any other complaint before the commission, be evidence of each and every fact found. This would leave the way open for gross abuses, and would permit of an intending litigant bringing a fictitious action against himself for the purpose of establishing certain facts in view of action being subsequently brought by or against another party. </para>

                            <para>- That to a very large extent removes my objection. If the Government can see its way to have the Bill postponed for a little, I think it will be wise for them to defer its consideration. I have been asked by some persons if I would vote for the second reading of the Bill "this day six months," but I do not feel free as a supporter of the Ministry to join in any action of that sort. At the same time, considering the urgent and grave business now before Parliament, I think this Bill might be put very low down on the business paper. The Ministry arc not in the least to be blamed for having brought the Bill forward, because it formed a part of the programme which was , announced by the Prime Minister at Maitland. But I think there ore other measures which must be pushed forward in preference to this Bill. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has moved an amendment which provides that the Bill shall come into force as soon as the Governor-General in Council makes a proclamation, but I think that would be giving too much power under the circumstances. I hope that Ministers will allow the Bill to stand in abeyance for the present, so that we may have further time for deliberation before committing the country to the great expense that will be involved in the carrying out of the provisions of the measure. I am anxious to avoid incurring any unnecessary expense at this time, when our financial requirements can only be met by the exercise of the strictest economy. </para>

It was anticipated that the other two Bills which have been disposed of would have occupied the attention of the House for a longer period. In the circumstances I shall not ask the House to proceed further to-night. I may state that we propose to proceed with this measure to-morrow. There are reasons why it should be placed upon the statute-book in some form or other before the session closes. </para>
