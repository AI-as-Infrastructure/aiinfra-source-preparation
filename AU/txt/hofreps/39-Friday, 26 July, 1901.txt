                        <para>- The Postmaster-General is aware that the men employed at the 'Melbourne General Post-office as temporary porters do not receive a full half-holiday each week, but their work, though similar, is not the same as that performed by the permanent porters, as the latter have greater responsibilities. He cannot promise to take steps to see that they receive more holiday time than at present. As their work is not continuous, they are not required to be in attendance 48 hours per week, and they are allowed to leave at 3 and 3.30 p.m., instead of at 6.30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- The Government has decided that officers of the Commonwealth forces promoted for service in South Africa shall be allowed to retain their rank on their return to the Commonwealth. It would not be found practicable to apply this rule to all cases, other than officers, as in the case of those permanently employed there could not be found positions in which to place them in accordance with their rank. Therefore, they would either have to forego their positions or forego their rank. But, wherever found practicable, it is the desire of the Government that those who win promotion on service shall retain it on their return. </para>

Realizing as I did, as Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales for many years, the importance of getting up-to-date information on all matters appertaining to agriculture, on behalf of the Government of that State, I offered a bursary to the most successful student in its agricultural colleges. That bursary enabled him to go to the best college in the world for two or three years' training, and was a means of keeping the department informed as to what was being done in a practical way elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- It has been considered a small matter by many people, but I realized that it was not a small matter. Notwithstanding all the ridicule to which I was subject, I went on because I knew that underlying it was an important principle which, if acted upon, would ultimately be of immense benefit to our dairy farmers and others. We sent to the old country and obtained the very best herd that could be obtained, in order to improve the breed of dairy cattle in our State, and I have no hesitation in saying that, before ten years are passed, the people of that State, and I believe the other States, will realize the immense importance of this new branch of agricultural 'education. </para>

                            <para>- I consider that this was one of the best things we ever did in New South Wales to assist agricultural education. I know that in our State, in some of the dairies two cows were being kept where one of the proper breed would have been sufficient, and would have given better results. Unless steps of this kind are taken, how can we expect to secure that remunerative trade with Great Britain - the butter trade - and place ourselves in as good a position as Denmark, as we ought to do, because our natural resources are greater than those of that country ? In many ways we are in a better position than Denmark to compete for the butter trade, but we cannot expect to compete unless we improve our herds and improve our methods in every way, not only in regard to the herds, but also in regard to the system of export and the handling of goods at home. As I said, I was subject to a great deal of criticism by many people who do not understand anything about agriculture, and who look on a matter of this kind as of very small importance. I dare say that some great men look on matters of this kind as of no moment, but to the bone and sinew of the country they are of great concern. More than 50 per cent, of the whole population of the world are engaged in agriculture. That shows the necessity of the Federal Government giving consideration to this important question. We have also established experimental farms and agricultural colleges, or at least one agricultural college on a large scale in our State. When this college was started, some narrow - minded people, as I would call them, objected to students coming from the other States, but the Government decided to open the college to all, being anxious to benefit the whole of the States. I am glad to say that we have had a number of students from both Queensland and Victoria. The late </para>

                        <para>Summing up the results of our inspection and inquiries at Hawkesbury College and Farm, we are unanimous in the opinion that the system of education adopted,- together with the general organization of the institution, both in regard to class-room and farm work, are excellent. The institution is most certainly an object lesson for all the Australian colonies, and reflects credit upon the Department of Agriculture, the principal of the College, and the teaching staff. Our inquiries at the College extended over two days, and during this period we were able to thoroughly appreciate the fact that the institution has become highly popular with the agriculturists of New South Wales. Not the least important part of the work of the College is, in our opinion, the facilities afforded to growers all over the colony of taking advantage of the expert knowledge of the principal and his staff by means of inquiries by letter and by personal visits. </para>
                        <para>It is certain that the liberal and progressive policy of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, not only in relation to the maintenance of educational establishments, but in the provision of instruction through the agency of expert officers, and suitable publications, has a marked influence upon the improvement and extension of the rural industries of the colony. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry to say that view was not taken. I regret it is taken in very few countries, but it ought to be taken. 1 trust that if a federal department of agriculture be formed, it will endeavour to induce the States to move in this direction. I admit that it would not come under our jurisdiction; but I have no doubt that the States, having regard to the importance of the subject, would receive kindly any suggestions made by the Federal Government. It is a question which ought to be considered from every point of view, and I trust that an addition will be made to the work carried out in the various States if a federal department of agriculture be formed. One of the most important things which could be done by a department of agriculture is the bringing about of uniformity in experiments. While we have six State departments of agriculture, with six different systems of experimental work, all engaged in trying to bring about the same results, but employing six different agencies, we have a loss of energy as well as of money. If we could bring about uniformity in regard to many of the investigations, and arrange that they should be carried out in, say, one State, and for the Federal Government to assist all proper investigations, then I think much -good would result. The Federal Government could insure uniformity in regard to experiments, and carry out the work of inspection. There is no doubt that with six departments carrying on. six different systems, with one not knowing what was being carried on by the other, there must be a loss of energy and of money. The Federal Government exists to prevent the occurrence of this loss, and to endeavour to bring about uniformity in this respect, to save the States and the people of the Commonwealth from a useless expenditure. I believe that much of the work carried out in the various States could be concentrated, say at one college for one particular experiment, and at another for another ; and let the Federal Government, like the Federal Government in the United States, give to each State a certain sum to carry out certain investigations. At the same time it should insist upon knowing exactly what is being done by the State colleges, and should require information as to the work carried out. In the United States the Government also insist that each State Government shall send to the other full information on the different work which is carried out in order that what is done at one place shall be used for the benefit of all. There is another very important matter which, largely affects our trade. Some persons say that quarantine does not come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government except in regard to human beings. But I think it embraces the quarantine of stock, fruit trees, fruits, and everything else. Let us consider the losses which have occurred in Queensland from the tick fever. Up to 1899 the losses from tick fever in that State amounted to about 334,000 head of cattle. In the Townsville district alone the stock-owners lost 232,000 head of cattle. At the present time there is a want of uniformity with regard to quarantine regulations, and in view of those great losses it is important that the States which have not been infected with tick fever should protect their farmers and stock-owners from an invasion. Take our dairy herds in the Richmond River district. If the fever came there, what would it mean ? It would mean ruination to all the dairy farmers. And if it came over to Victoria, the effect would be the same. We know very well that when the matter is left to one State, for fear of damaging its interests it very often conceals diseases which exist. To avoid that danger quarantine ought to be made a federal matter, because we are interested in protecting the whole of the States. If a State relaxes its quarantine regulations by allowing diseased cattle to come over its border, that may mean, as it has meant in Queensland, a serious loss to the dairy farmers and pastoralists. The quarantine regulations should be uniform, and the Federal Government should have supervision in order to protect the States against tick fever or any other disease. Again, take the case of pigs. In New South Wales we are  extra careful. We prescribe that pigs shall be in quarantine for 60 days, whereas in Victoria and in Western Australia the period is 30 days. j After very complete inquiry the Government of New South Wales came to the conclusion that 60 days' quarantine should be prescribed for pigs. Supposing that through the want of uniformity, through carelessness, or through pigs not having sufficient time at | the quarantine ground, the swine fever was 1 introduced into our States, what might happen ? What happened in Denmark when the swine fever was introduced ? The Danes had a large and growing trade with Germany and other States, but immediately swine fever was known to exist in Denmark, the whole of the trade ceased, because the importation of pork from that country was prohibited. Again, take cattle. In New South Wales, the period of quarantine is 40 days, and in Western Australia 30 days. For sheep the period of quarantine is 30 days in our State from the United Kingdom, and from other countries 60 days ; whereas in Tasmania it is 30 days, and in Western Australia 14 days. We all know the great danger there is of scab being introduced among our sheep. In view of the importance of the industry, it is to our interest to see that proper regulations are enforced in order to prevent the possibility of any disease coming in. Again, take the importation of dogs. In New South Wales the period of quarantine is six months, and here I may say that I took the trouble to interview one of Pasteur's leading men, and asked what period was necessary to prevent the possibility of hydrophobia coming into our State. He advised me that a period of not less than six months was necessary ; and yet in Queensland they are agitating for a period of three months. </para>

                            <para>- There has been no case because we have been very particular, and that is a reason why we ought to have uniform quarantine regulations. In Victoria they have introduced a system which I do not believe in, private quarantine. We all know the dangers of introducing a system of that kind. We know how it can be abused. At all events I hope that the Federal Government will be able to see their way clear to establish a department which will have supervision over the quarantine regulations. The same remark is 'applicable to our fruits. We know that diseases in fruits occur in different States. We must have a uniform law in regard to the prevention of the spread of those diseases, because if New South Wales permits infected fruit trees to remain on her borders, it is only a question of time when those diseases will find admission to Victoria and go right through the various States. I feel that- these are questions which ought to be taken up by the Federal </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend mar be desirous of speaking. I do not trouble the House very often, but I have ventured to trouble it upon this occasion, because if any man can claim to have given attention to the subject of agriculture it is myself. I have had to work myself, and I know what it is to live by agriculture. I know what the farmers require, and what ought to be done for them by a department of agriculture. I speak warmly upon this matter, because to a very large extent, I think that the prosperity of our agriculturists depends upon the system adopted by the States and by the Commonwealth Parliament. Whilst I know that some of our States may take exception to the action of this Parliament in making any proposals bearing upon agricultural education, I feel that if they are approached - as they no doubt will be approached - in a fair and conciliatory way, they will not place any obstructions whatever in the way of the Federal Government, but will assist them to perfect their scheme. If we all work unitedly together - as I hope we shall - we will place agriculture on the highest pedestal as regards its teaching and improvement, and I feel sure that a great work will be achieved, and splendid results will accrue to the people of United Australia. </para>

No. 8 provides that a resident magistrate  and one justice of the peace may try a native for misdemeanour and give him two years. Section 5 excludes cases of murder, wounding with intent, rape, burglary with assault and intent to murder, these being remitted to the Supreme Court; section 6 allows any resident magistrate or two justices of the peace to give a native one year's imprisonment for offences under section 4, and section 7 allows one justice of the peace to do what is provided for in section 6 if there is no other justice of the peace within 20 miles. </para>

                            <para>- The next Act that I wish to quote was passed in 1892, two years after responsible government came into force, distinctly omitted the provision that justices of the peace must not fay cases in which they are interested. A's soon as the colony became a self-governing colony it proceeded to make that enactment. This was the first time that the law provided for the whipping of natives. It not only allows natives to be whipped, but alters the principal Act by giving any single magistrate power to imprison a native for two years. Previously to that it required a resident magistrate and an honorary justice to deal with such cases. Under this Act of 1892 one justice may imprison a native for two years ; and, in the case of males, order a whipping up to 25 strokes. </para>

                        <para>One cause, perhaps the greatest cause in my opinion, of the cruelty is the system by which natives are indentured to settlers. This is only a form of slavery, as the natives, for the most part, do not know what it means, and for the rest, do not dare not to sign the agreement. As soon as a man is indentured he is absolutely under the power of his master. ... I think that unless a policeman is really attacked he should not be allowed to shoot at natives. </para>

Unfortunately, while there has been an informal conversation, the necessary authorities to the Speaker and President of the State Parliament have not yet reached their hands, but when they do the whole of these matters will be taken into consideration together, and I have no doubt with a satisfactory result. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the great importance of many of the measures on the business-paper. It is desirable that the fullest opportunity should be afforded to honorable members to read and consider the provisions of the measures to be proceeded with from time to time. If, at the adjournment of the House each night, the Government could see their way to inform honorable members of the business to be taken next, I am sure that they would come here much better prepared to deal with it than they do. That practice was followed in the Victorian Parliament, and I think it is a very good one. </para>
