The criticism which will then be accorded to it by those who are authorized and qualified to criticise it on behalf of the people of Australia will receive the most attentive consideration. </para>

                    <para>During the last decade there has been a remarkable awakening of our farmers to the desirability of having more definite information regarding all matters connected with their business. The result has been that the stations and this department have been led to publish a vast amount of information both old and new, which has been freely distributed to farmers in every country of the Union. Nothing like it has ever been seen before. No country has ever before attempted so systematic and so thorough a distribution of information to its agricultural population, and no masses of farmers have ever so eagerly sought for information as have our own within the past few years. Such an intellectual awakening must have most important results, and there is every indication that it will go on increasing in volume and force until it has thoroughly permeated the entire' agricultural population of the country. </para>

                    <para>These institutions are in law and in fact integral parts of the higher institutions for education in agriculture, representing, essentially, the University side of such education, being set above the undergraduate departments of the colleges as organizations devoted to' original research. They ore the fountain heads of agricultural knowledge, and the results of their work are more and more to form the basis of all instruction in agricultural science' from the college down to the common school, and out to the masses of workers on our farms. Already they have surpassed all other agencies in the dissemination of useful information among our farmers, and have collected a fund of new knowledge, which has radically changed the textbooks and courses of instruction in agriculture in this country. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it would. More than that, it would bring back more than ten times the amount in freight on the railways - to put it in the most selfish fashion. I want to see the broad and enlightened policy foreshadowed for us and displayed for our benefit by these great countries taken advantage of. Perhaps I may be thought a little enthusiastic, but I have no hesitation in saying this, that unless some such system is adopted, we shall fall behind. I think it is imperatively necessary that we should do it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and in Victoria and South Australia also. But what I would like to see at this point is more systematic and co-ordinate effort on the part of Australia. "We are undoubtedly having good work done, but we are not having it done to the extent with the force, vigour, and system that are desirable, and the farmers of Australia are not getting the benefits that the farmers of Canada and the United States are obtaining at the present moment from the immense united and systematic efforts that are being put forth in those countries. In these departments of cross-fertilization and the fixture of nitrogen two great lines of agricultural progress are open to us. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire to take up an improper proportion of the time of honorable members. I feel that this is a great question. If we reckon it in cost of human labour, so great has been the advance of science in every department, that in the United States the cost of the production of a bushel of wheat, or of a bushel of corn, or of a ton of hay, has wonderfully diminished within the last few years. In point of time alone - and it is comforting to reflect on these tilings - it is estimated that in 1855 it occupied four and a half hours of human labour to produce a bushel of corn, and in 1894 only 40 minutes. The relative cost of wheat was less than a third; the time as between 1830 and 1S96 was as three hours to ten minutes, and the cost as between 17 cents and 3 cents. In regard to hay, from 18C0 to 1890 a ton required in human labour 36 hours from the beginning of the mowing to the pressing, and in 1890 about eleven and a half hours ; while the cost at the latter time was 50 per cent, of what it was at the earlier time. When we see these marvellous advances have been made, we should endeavour, not only to keep abreast of them, but for our profit as well as our pride, to strive to be ahead of all. I desire to say this, and only this, in conclusion : feeling that I have done anything but justice to this great subject. I believe that if we undertake this work we shall do much to give heart and encouragement to those of our fellow citizens who are engaged in this occupation. Remember, sir, that all our splendid Commonwealth architecture is only useful so far as it can be used to maintain, promote, and advance the great productive industries of the country. All this paraphernalia, as I may term it - necessary paraphernalia - is only the gold lace of the Constitution, unless we can make of it an engine for the promotion of the materia], moral, and social welfare of the people. Bright said that the nation was practically in the cottage. That, of course, symbolizes the whole thing, and we find that the nation is evidenced in the labourer in whatever capacity he may be employed - not using that term in any restrictive sense, but using it as applied to every man who is doing work for the advancement of his country. What we need to do with regard to agriculture in all its varied forms, is to liberalize it, to raise it to a level higher than it has ever occupied before, to give it a dignity, a worth and a profit which may raise the Australian nation in the whole scale of civilization. </para>

                        <para>- In most parts; but I am speaking of Australia as a whole, which is in what we may term the irrigation zone. That zone extends from the 15th to the 35th parallel of latitude. If any one looks at the map of the world, he will see that all the countries that are within these parallels have to use every effort to conserve, distribute, and utilize the whole of their water supplies, in order that they may progress. Just as those countries apply themselves to the conservation, distribution, and utilization of their water supplies, so they prosper, and just as they neglect to conserve the supply, so they decay. I wish to cali attention, to-night, to the practical lessons that are taught, not only to our own country, but to other countries. Australia is divided by the tropic of Capricorn - half of it is in the higher temperate zone, and the other half is in the tropical zone. </para>

                        <para>- On the Murrumbidgee it is recommended that there shall be a weir near Yanko Creek to command 3,600,000 acres, The soil there is good, and the cost of a weir to store 9,268,000,000 cubic feet, is put down at £150,000. The cost of the Bungowannah weir is not put down, but I have consulted with professional men, who say that the cost would not be by any means prohibitive. Another weir spoken of .is below the Umarella River, and this would store 6,000,000,000 cubic feet of water at a cost of £45,000. Another weir is recommended below the Goodradigha River to store 10,000,000,000 cubic feet of water at a cost of £71,000. The -tract of country north of the Murrumbidgee could be watered by canal, 6 miles below Wagga, for 130 miles, with 80 miles of branches, which would command 1,500,000 acres, at a cost of £509,260. In the Lachlan there is a delta formed by the junction of that river and the Willandra, comprising an area of 6,000 square miles. The storage site would hold 3,750,000,000 cubic feet, and the work of constructing a weir there would cost £30,000. On the Darling, with its 19,000 square miles of catchment area, - 10,000 of which are in New South Wales and 9,000 in Queensland - there is ample opportunity for storing and distributing water at a very small cost. There are also in that country numerous lakes, many of which the pastoralists have locked up in grazing areas. The lock made at Bourke has been a great success and has been constructed at a very slight cost. The summary of these reports is that they strongly recommend weirs at Bungowannah and Yanko Creek. I would point out that the latter weir would take in the waters of the Murray River before very many of its tributaries had joined it, and therefore the waters from those tributaries would go to swell its volume and could be utilized lower down. I have, on the very best authority, a computation of the water available at this point for use. The highest discharge per minute ever known - and readings have been taken since 1877 - is 1,800,000 cubic feet, and the least discharge is 25,000 cubic feet. The highest total discharge - taken from the readings - was in 1894, when it was represented by 78,750,000 cubic feet. Allowing for one-half of that discharge to go to waste in distribution, percolation, and otherwise - and in discussing irrigation we must always base our figures upon the least discharge known - it would irrigate 927,422 acres a foot deep by gravitation. The possible results of the distribution of such a quantity of water over that area of land are something enormous, and that work would not preclude the formation of locks lower down to still further utilize that river. There is one peculiarity about the Murray River, namely, that it loses an enormous quantity of its volume before it reaches Swan Hill. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; Professor Hilgard points out that there are irrigation districts where the soil is not losing its strength, where it is still as productive as ever, and where the water comes from artesian wells, and that there are other districts which are fed by clear springs,- with scarcely any sediment at all. Now he finds out by analysis of these soils, and he has made over one thousand analyses, that they contain to an enormous extent potash, lime, magnesia, and sulphuric and phosphoric acids, elements which are required for the successful cultivation of the soil. These elements have been accumulated throughout the ages by the process called weathering of the soil, and they are there to be utilized simply by the application of water to them. He finds by analysis that these arid soils, which were looked upon only a few years ago as almost valueless, and which were sold at from 2s. 6d. to 5s. per acre, are now, through the application of water, worth from £10 to £20 per acre. These soils, compared with the soils of the eastern States of America, which are considered good, contain three times as much potash, six times as much magnesia, and fourteen times as much lime. He finds, further, that these arid districts are always rich districts, and that in limestone districts agriculture can always be carried on successfully, with the application of water. We have in the north of Victoria in our mallee country, possibilities which no one can very well conceive, if we can apply water to that large tract, and the same tiling may be said of very large areas of country in the adjoining State of New South Wales, and also in other States We read of Damascus and other countries where, by the use of water, they were enabled to enjoy the utmost comfort and to surround themselves with the greatest beauties, and we know that here we have the opportunity of matching those conditions, not in one place, but in dozens of places. We may also look to the developments of more recent years in such places as Los Angelos, Utah, and Denver, and a dozen different places in America. A friend of mine who recently visited Los Angelos was completely struck with its beauty and the comforts by which the people were surrounded, and he told me that it looked like a little bit of heaven dropped down to this earth. We can produce the same results here by the application of water to our soil. Irrigation is not an adjunct of agriculture, but over a great portion of this country it will have to be agriculture itself. The results of irrigation and the application of water to the soil are more far reaching than the mere increase in the productiveness of the . soil, because the general economic changes that follow are more marked. I should like my democratic friends to notice these facts. One of the effects of irrigation is to compel the establishment of small farms, because no monopoly in land can exist under a proper system of irrigation. It brings about co-operation in works, and the equitable distribution of water. It fosters industrial independence, and upon the small farms established under this system the labourer can earn all that he needs for himself, his wife, and children. The return for labour becomes almost as much a certainty as anything can be certain, and men become assured of a good living. It gives the comforts of the town with all the pleasures and joys of a country life. One advantage that is derivable is that it enables us to supply moisture in varying quantities just as the plant may require it. We have the water at command, and can give a small quantity or a larger supply just as it may be needed. So we are able to command the seasons instead of being dependent upon thorn. America has gone ahead enormously in this way, and we have opportunities here, just as they have in America, if we choose to take advantage of them. What the future of Australia will be if we properly utilize our water supply resources no one can conceive, but without that utilization of water it requires a very small gift of prophecy to say what the future will be. These words of mine are no dreamer's vision, but they can be transformed into solid facts if we are able to face the position that lies before us, and prove equal to the fulfilment of our proper destiny. History has told us the story over and over again, and we have only to follow her teachings in order to insure success. What we should do first of all is to make inquiries as to what is now being done in the United States. We require a survey by which we can ascertain the rainfall over this continent, the capacity for storage, and the volume of our rivers, and everything else in the way of useful information relating to our water supply and its utilization. In America the River Mississippi, the father of waters, is dependent upon large storages in order to maintain it as a perennial stream, and we shall have to work hand in hand as States in order to secure the most beneficial results in this matter. We do not want to regard the border line as separating us in our irrigation projects, but we want to realize that whatever works are carried out will be equally beneficial to the people on both sides of that line. The cost may be somewhat great, hut surely we can face it. I am told that the State of Western Australia is entering upon a project for taking water through pipes for a distance of 360 miles, and the source from which the water is derived is many feet lower than the point at which it is to be delivered. Six pumping stations are to be established in connexion with this scheme, and the estimated cost is £2,500,000; but it is likely it will extend to £4,000,000 before it is completed. Surely if one State can take in hand a work of that kind, we should be able to spend a million or two upon water supply in order to secure the benefits that I have spoken of to-day. We have gone very largely into water supply works in Victoria, and we have spent a very considerable amount of money, some of which has not been wisely spent and has not proved productive. That, however, has not been the fault of irrigation itself, but has. been due to the subject being a new one to us, and to the foot that our farmers and engineers were unskilled and inexperienced.. As in all experiments, the work had to be carried out at a certain amount of loss. The - cost of national water supply works has been £838,100. The total amount of money lent to irrigation trusts is a little over £1,000,000, and the total amount spent on country water supply by the State, ex- elusive of the Yan Yean, Coliban, and Geelong works, is £3,330,000. That was a considerable amount to spend, but unfortunately we are not deriving the benefit we should be from a great part of that outlay. . We have not the water supply that is. necessary to fill the channels that are constructed, so that many of our works have been productive only of disappointment and loss. That, however, may be remedied very largely by undertaking the work I have spoken of to-day, by which the water could be conveyed from Albury right away to the;western borders of "Victoria. This question! of agriculture, with its cognate subject irrigation, is one of the greatest the House can consider - far greater than the Tariff or any other question, because it means the encouragement of the settlement of the people on the land. We cannot grow as a community unless our people find productive employment. It makes one ashamed to see hundreds of people looking for work when we have in this continent such boundless capacities for employment. With a proper system of irrigation and the introduction of the best agricultural methods, employment. will be found for every one, and comfort and happiness will be generally promoted. By agreeing to the suggestion that has been made by the honorable member for Indi, and . by carrying out the ideas that have been put . forward to-day, we shall be able to settle thousands of people in comfortable homes, whore they can live by following agricultural occupations. We shall lift up to a much higher plane the occupation of the agriculturist, and generally produce results which: will reflect credit on ourselves as the first members of this House of Representatives. </para>
