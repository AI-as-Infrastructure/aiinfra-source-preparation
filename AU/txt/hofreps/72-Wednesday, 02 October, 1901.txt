                        <para>- I thought last night that this was too important a Bill for one to speak upon from first impressions, and I therefore asked for an adjournment of the debate, so that I might look into it more carefully. It seems to deal with two classes of property - with property hereafter to be acquired and with property passing under the Constitution. As regards property hereafter to be acquired, the power to acquire seems to be given under subsection (31) of section 51 of the Constitution Act, which says - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it does. The park lands which surround Adelaide have been dedicated under a State Act, but this clause gives power to the Commonwealth to acquire them, notwithstanding such dedication. The matter is one which requires much consideration, and the proposal should not receive acquiescence until a little more justification is shown for it. </para>

That is not the usual method, nor do I see on what ground of expediency the Minister can insist upon it. Last night attention was drawn to the fact that this Bill gives recourse only to the High Court of Australia, and I really cannot understand how it is that provisions of this sort have found their way into almost every </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; recourse ought to be given to the High Court or to a court exercising federal jurisdiction, which would really he the State Supreme Courts. The provision in this Bill involves an extreme degree of centralization, because a man in Western Australia, whose property was taken from him, would be dragged to the High Court of Justice in New South Wales, not only to have the land valued, but to have, it maybe, his petty interest determined. I do not know really whether this is a case of the draftsman slipping into loose verbiage, or whether the provision has been made in accordance with the policy of the Ministry. In either case it is, at the very least, reprehensible that the Bill should have been framed in its present form. Now, the most important provisions of this Bill are contained in clauses 44 and 45, and 1 should like to say a few words regarding them, although the Prime Minister has declared that these clauses will not be finally settled until the conference of the Premiers of the various States and the Prime Minister, or whatever Federal Minister represents the Commonwealth, has taken place. There is, no doubt, a great deal of misapprehension as to the effect of these clauses, and a great deal of interest is being taken in the various States in finding out what will be their probable operation. As regards both clauses 44 and 45, I might say that the Constitution requires that before this Bill was introduced - I will put it almost as strongly as that - the Government should have endeavoured to come to an agreement with the various States as to values. </para>

                            <para>- Very well. Let us see. Section 85 of the Constitution provides, under sub-section (1), for the taking over of property used exclusively in connexion with the department, and this property is of two classes - namely, property used exclusively and permanently by the Commonwealth, and property used exclusively and temporarily. I do not know how the Ministry provides for estimating the value of property used temporarily by the Commonwealth. The class of property that is referred to is, I suppose, border Custom-houses that will be no longer used after Inter-State free-trade is established - to the best of my recollection that was the reason why the provision was inserted in the Constitution. There is no means of estimating the value of these properties at present, but there is a clause in the Bill which provides that the State interested in such property shall take the steps necessary to claim compensation within 90 days after the acquisition by the Commonwealth on the passing of the Act. Under these circumstances it will not be possible to wait until the introduction of free-trade before a valuation is placed upon the property. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but clear cases of necessity ought to be provided for explicitly in the Bill. The permission given to the High Court to extend the time is intended to cover unforeseen contingencies, but when we can foresee what is likely to happen, we ought to provide for such cases in the Bill - otherwise it is a case of bad draftsmanship. The Bill does not contain any provision as to how the value of properties not permanently required is to be assessed. The other class of property that passes under the Constitution, or that may be 'acquired under the Constitution - is any property of the States used, but not exclusively used, in connexion with a department ; and it is provided in section 85, sub-section (2), of the Constitution that the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in as nearly as may be the manner in which the value of land or of an interest in land taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth. The Bill does not comply with the conditions of that subsection (2). That sub-section seems to clearly require that before we can resort to the State method of ascertaining the value of the land - the Bill does not provide for, but rather abolishes, the State method, which is the only method the Constitution gives us - we must try to enter into an agreement with the State, which is the owner, from which the land is taken over. It is the same with property passing under sub-section (1). That is a condition precedent to legislation, and our power is contingent upon it. Under sub-section (3) of section 85 of the Constitution, it is provided - </para>

Property so passing or acquired under the Constitution cannot be the subject of voluntary acquisition or bargaining between the parties under the first division of Part 2 of the Bill. In regard to property that is passed under the Constitution, 'for which sub-sections (1) and (3) of section 88 provide, all that is to be done is to estimate the value and the mode of compensation. The Constitution clearly lays down in sub-section (2) of section 85 that the Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State of any kind, used, but not exclusively used, in connexion with a department; but a condition precedent to legislation as to the mode of compensation, or the method of ascertaining the value, is that an effort shall be made to come to an agreement with the States. </para>

Some of these provisions might not have been necessary if some mode of valuation and compensation had been agreed upon between the Commonwealth and the State Governments. Clause 47 provides that the provisions of the Bill as regards land acquired under the Bill are, generally speaking, to apply to land which is passed under or has been acquired under section 85 of the Constitution. That is the effect of the two sub-clauses of clause 47. Sub-clause (2) provides - </para>

The method prescribed there is to allow the State law to operate as to the determination of the value. That method varies. In some States arbitration is provided for, whilst in others recourse is at once had to the court. In this Bill provision is made not for the method mentioned in the Constitution, and the words in the Bill, clause 47, sub-clause (2), providing that the value shall be ascertained in as nearly as may be the method of the Bill, have no validity. The effect of this is to entirely upset the Constitution. </para>

                            <para>- The effect can only be gathered from the provisions in the Bill and the intentions of the Ministry as therein apparent. I say that the principle of subclause (2) of clause 47 of the Bill is the opposite of the principle of sub-section (2) of section 85 of the Constitution, and I think that the honorable and learned, member for Northern Melbourne, if he looks into the matter, as he seems to have done fairly closely, will agree with me on that point. Clauses 44 and. 45 are those upon which the greatest degree of public anxiety exists. Now, with regard to clause 44, I am. very glad the Ministry have adopted the suggestion which I made under almost hopeless circumstances in the Convention. I remember tabling a motion at the Melbourne session almost in the terms of this subclause. The present Prime Minister agreed with me, or at least said that it was a subject worthy of consideration, and called upon the Treasurers of the various States to express their opinions. The two State Treasurers who spoke - one of whom was the present Federal Treasurer - gave their opinions against the motion. The suggestion which I made to take over an equivalent in debt to the value of the properties transferred was negatived in the Convention without division. I am glad that, on the principle that time gives wisdom even to Ministers, they have adopted the suggestion which met with so little acceptance from the Treasurers in that Convention.The method which I suggested could have been accomplished then, but I doubt whether we can constitutionally pass clause 44 now. I will quote from what I said in the Convention - </para>

                            <para>- Strictly speaking, it would ; but as a matter of fact we could not deal with it in that way. The money being large would have to be borrowed, and the interest would have to be paid per head of the population of all the States, and ultimately also the principal. We could not do that except under exceptional circumstances in our present position, where we are unable - the Government say we are, but I have a doubt as to that - to deal with credits due to the States for purchase money of their properties as if it were revenue. We could technically throw the whole obligation on a monthly balance, assuming we are able to treat the purchase: money as revenue raised, but I do not think we can constitutionally do that. Section S9 does not justify that, sub-section 1 of that section providing that until the imposition of uniform duties of customs, the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein. How can we call purchase money due in respect-, of properties revenue? </para>

                            <para>- For instance, all receipts by the Commonwealth that can be retained by the Commonwealth, or has to be paid to the States will be revenue, but all receipts by the Commonwealth cannot be pure Commonwealth revenue, because the Commonwealth receives a portion as trustee for the States. The Commonwealth, for example, collects all Customs revenue, but it cannot retain the whole, three-fourths being held in trust for the States. We cannot however describe a credit due to the States as purchase moneys of property as received by the Commonwealth, and collected in the States, but that is what clause 45 does. It regards a sum payable for properties of the States, as if it were received under section 89 ; and I say that is wrong. </para>

                            <para>- Whether the Minister has so consented or not, I do not think that any honorable member who wishes to deal comprehensively with this measure can fail, or should fail, to deal primarily with that aspect of the Bill. Looking at the Bill as a whole, with a considerable practical knowledge of 'the Acts in existence in the mother State in regard to the acquisition of property - I refer to the Public Works Act, and the Land for Public Purposes Acquisition Act - I can see clearly that this measure runs very much on the lines of those measures. I am bound to say that experience in the mother State has shown that the general principle on which those Acts have been based is a very good one. The principle effects a very good result with regard to the owners of land, and, on the whole, has worked well. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt I had that proportion running in my mind. All legal members know that, with regard to the taxing of costs, if a deduction of more than one-sixth is made from the original bill, the attorney whose bill it is must pay the cost of taxation, whereas, if he recovers more than five-sixths of the amount claimed, he obtains costs from the other side. There is another aspect of this question, upon which, I think, the experience of New South Wales is valuable. Clauses 13 and 14 set out the principle upon which valuations shall be made. That principle was not laid down in the first Property Acquisition Act passed in New South Wales, but experience showed that very often, where part of a property was taken, the public work for which it was resumed increased the value of the remaining land by, in some cases, a greater amount than the value of the resumed area. For instance, if a man owned 10 acres of land, and 1 acre was acquired for the purposes of railway construction, it was often found that the value of the remaining 9 acres was increased by the construction of the railway to an amount larger than the value of the acre that was taken from him. Under the old state of the law, however, he was allowed to retain the added value of the 9 acres, and at the same time to obtain compensation for the 1 acre of which he had been dispossessed. The later Act provided that when the valuation of the land taken over was being made, the arbitrators or the jury - because in some cases the question went before arbitrators first, and if either party was dissatisfied by their award, then before a jury - should have the right, where the added value of the land which was left was as great as, or greater than, the value of the land taken, to deduct the added value from the compensation which was due though not so as to make the claimant a debtor. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly should, rather than that they should not pay for what they take. I think that the Commonwealth will ultimately have to borrow money, and it is immaterial what the amount may be if it receives value for the money. How does the Minister expect the Commonwealth to take over the railways of all the States, at a valuation of probably £100,000,000, without paying money over to the States to enable them to reduce their debts? </para>

                            <para>- There would be no real difference as far as that is concerned, because a debenture is really only an I.O.U. When a State borrows a million of money in the London market it merely gives pieces of paper undertaking to pay back the money in 20 or 30 years, as the case may be, and to pay interest at a certain rate during the currency of the loan. It does not matter whether these I.O.U's. are given to the public for cash, or whether they are given, like bank notes, to the State to compensate it for whatever assets the Commonwealth has taken over. But if we are going to conduct Commonwealth affairs on business lines, we shall have to recognise that the States and the Commonwealth a16 distinct legal entities, and that the accounts should be kept between them as if they were two separate individuals. In New South Wales each department is managed on that principle, and so far has that system been carried, that in order to ascertain what stamps are used for postage and what for revenue purposes distinct stamps are used for postage and duty purposes respectively. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. This Bill provides that the sum shall not | in the case of any State exceed the amount ] of compensation payable to that State. It ' is not intended to claim any more. It would I indeed be an interesting state of things if the Commonwealth made the States give up their assets, and then said: - " We will compel you to give us something further to pay for another State's assets." </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. It has, to use a business phrase, "an unlimited uncalled capital." It has the power to call to an unlimited extent upon the citizens of the Commonwealth - even though they are paying money as citizens of the various States - in order to pay for the properties which are taken over. If the Commonwealth takes over these properties, it cannot say - "We have no money to pay for them." It has been given unlimited powers of taxation in order to raise money if it wants it for this purpose. But it does not need to exercise those powers. No Commonwealth Government would be justified in raising money by direct taxation to pay for capital expenditure. It is almost an axiom of political finance that where- a State is spending money on a permanent asset it is justified in borrowing money for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The axiom is sound enough if the asset is a permanent one.; but it is very open to question how far loan moneys should be spent upon such perishable works as wooden bridges. I want to impress on the honorable member in charge of the Bill that if he or the Government have any doubt as to how they will ultimately pay for these assets which they are taking over - and this is an element in' the conclusion they have arrived at - then it is not a logical element. They have unlimited power of taxing directly, and they have unlimited power to borrow, so far as the world will lend, on their debentures and bonds. </para>

There is the general and unconditional provision " shall compensate," and that " if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation " - that is, as to the manner or method - " it (the manner or method) shall be determined under laws " - that is, as to the mode of compensation - "to be made by the Parliament." That mode, method, or manner is a very legitimate purpose in the Bill now before the House ; but the right to determine mode of compensation will not get rid of the liability. The section does not say that the Parliament shall determine whether they will pay or not, but that the Parliament shall determine only as to how they will pay. The mode is proposed in clause 44 of this Bill, which is an attempt to carry out the purpose of sub-section (3) of section 85 of the Constitution. Clause 44 provides : - </para>

                            <para>- The word "therein" would be a complete answer to the suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. A loan to the Commonwealth certainly could not be called revenue collected "in" the State, and, therefore, sub-section (1), it seems to me, applies to revenues which are collected in the different States, and that will be credited to the individual States. Subsection (2) of section89 provides that the Commonwealth shall debit to each State against that revenue, first - " The expenditure therein of the Commonwealth." That is the expenditure in the State of the Commonwealth - incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance, as to the time of the transfer of any department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is the intention and belief. But this section deals with a mere debit and credit proposal in regard to the so-called Braddon clauses. It is a proposal that, first of all, the States shall be credited with all revenues collected in each State by the Commonwealth, and then shall be debited the expenditure "for maintenance or continuance." These are comprehensive words in the sense that they will cover, in my opinion, the interest necessary in order to keep these departments going. That is to say, if the Commonwealth has, out of its own loan moneys, purchased the Post-offices, it would be perfectly entitled to say to a State - " If we credit you with the revenue which comes to you through these Custom-houses or Post-offices, we are entitled to debit you with the annual cost of the interest for the maintenance or continuance of those institutions." </para>

                            <para>- I think so; I say it is an element. If a man were manager of a business, and had to account to the owner of the shop, he would credit the owner with all the profits of the business, and debit him, amongst other charges, with the rent of the establishment, which rent is analogous to interest, or, if the property were mortgaged, and the manager were accounting to his principal in another country, he would credit the latter with all the profits, and debit him with the interest on the mortgage as a legitimate debit in the business. In my opinion, therefore, so long as the States are credited by the Commonwealth with the revenue which is produced by those transferred departments, the Commonwealth has a perfect right to debit the States on the other side of the account with interest on the capital expended. </para>

                            <para>- That would be so. The Commonwealth would pay the States the interest on their stock given as compensation for the property taken and debit it, or would give credit for it put of the moneys received as revenues on behalf of the States. Although the States would have given up their bonds or their debentures to pay for the capital value of these properties, they would not be the interest out of pocket. The Commonwealth would have to recognise their obligation from year to year, and pay the interest, and they would be able to take credit for the interest paid on behalf of the States. </para>

                            <para>- It may not itself be " maintenance," but it is current expenditure, and, therefore, part of the maintenance or continuance. I Have no doubt these two words are intended to comprehend all current expenditure made in order to get the revenue. We do not spend capital and interest in order to get revenue ; if we spend capital we do not spend interest - we cannot charge both. Therefore it is intended that the interest shall be chargeable as part of the current expenditure of the Commonwealth business in order to produce revenue. </para>

When the bookkeeping system comes to an end the Commonwealth will have a right to say - " We have the buildings ; you have our debentures."

We have at present no official information on this subject, and such information would be very serviceable to us in ascertaining the distinction between the State contributions as a State and its contributions per head of population. If the omission can be in any way repaired, I am sure honorable members will consider it an advantage to have the information. I look to the conference which is contemplated as likely to provide a solution of what is at the present time a rather troublesome matter. If I were a member of another place, I should certainly consider that under the provisions of the Bill the States would be placed at great disadvantage. </para>

                        <para>- The concluding words of the last speaker voice my opinion. I am afraid that under the Bill the States will be placed at a disadvantage. The Commonwealth Ministry have seen that we have a most difficult problem before us, and to allay any suspicion or doubt in the minds of the citizens of the States they have provided for a conference between the State Premiers and the Commonwealth Premier for the purpose of obtaining a harmonious agreement. I think, however, that it would have been wiser to delay the introduction of this measure into this Chamber until that conference had taken place, so that the House could deal immediately with whatever agreement was arrived at. As the Constitution provides in most unmistakable terms that compensation must be paid, I think that it would be wiser to clear up accounts by paying directly for transferred property. I cannot understand the legal stand-point, and the more it is presented te us the more intricate it appears to be. But I ask the Government to take a common every-day view of the position. I do not think that the Commonwealth is anxious to steal a march upon the States ; but there is a good deal of suspicion and unrest in regard to these proposals. The Vice-President of the Executive Council, for instance, stated that the value of the property transferred from the control of the New </para>

                            <para>- We understand we are not going to deal with the vital clauses of this Bill, but the public do not understand the position, and they are afraid that wo may commit ourselves to some particular course of action which may not be in accord with the views expressed by the Premiers. We are placed in a very peculiar position and I do not know what we are to think of a Ministry which sets such small value upon its own opinions, that it has felt constrained to ask the State Premiers to consult with it. In view of the uncertainty which exists in regard to this measure, not in political circles only, but also among commercial men, in New South Wales and the other States, I think it would be in the best interests not only of this House, but of the public, that we should allow this matter to stand over. </para>

Whatever is done, however, I hope that the Commonwealth will compensate the States to the full, according to the letter of the Constitution, for any property they may take over. It has been suggested that the States may squander the money that is paid over to them by the Commonwealth, but we have nothing to do with that. We have no power to ear-mark any money. that the States receive from us, whether it is paid in regard to these properties, or in respect to the transfer of the surplus Customs and Excise revenue. Although some of us might have liked to have had this power, we have no such authority, and we have no business to consider whether South Australia, Victoria, or New South Wales will squander any of the money returned to them. That is a matter entirely between the States and their creditors. I hope that the result of the conference will be that an amicable arrangement will be come to between the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to express any strong opinions, but I shall endeavour to follow the very admirable course adopted by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, in discussing the very intricate matters that arise under this measure. It would appear that the Constitution has hardly provided for all the exigencies of the cases that are likely to arise. Apparently there are three methods contemplated under the Constitution in which property may be acquired. The properties which are essential to the working of the transferred departments are divided into two classes ; that is, properties used exclusively in connexion with the departments, and properties used but not exclusively. Then again, under section 51, sub-section (31), of the Constitution, power is given to acquire properties for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. I have not noticed that that power has been dealt with in the speeches which have been made, because honorable members addressed themselves principally to the construction of section S5, dealing with properties in connexion wholly or in part with the transferred departments. When we come to consider the methods of" acquiring property, we find that section 85, sub-section (1), deals with property used exclusively in connexion with the department, and that sub-section (3) also deals with such property, but only to the extent of saying that the mode of compensation shall be determined under laws made by the Parliament, if no agreement has been made between the States and the Commonwealth. But as to the property used exclusively in connexion with a department, I have not been able to find out that there is any means of valuing it, or any direction as to how that property - which, of course, at present includes the largest proportion of what we are thinking of, namely, custom-houses and post-offices - is to be valued. </para>

                            <para>- It seems singular that in regard to a portion of the properties there is a direction as to the way in which the values are to be ascertained, whilst as to the major part of the property, that exclusively used by the Commonwealth, section 85 does not refer to the method of valuation to be adopted. This raises a very great difficulty in the consideration of this measure, for, if there is no principle laid down in the Constitution with regard to these properties, it may become a question as to whether we are entitled, as only one of the parties concerned, without the consent of the other party, to lay down the principle on which the value of these properties shall be ascertained. We are thinking aloud, to some extent, in discussing this matter, but I would press that point upon the attention of the Government, and ask them to give the committee the benefit of their opinions before the discussion closes. It may be necessary to consult the States as to the way in which these values shall be ascertained. </para>

But it may be that in very fairness some of the States will have to do so. Some of the States, by reason of their large area, have had to expend larger sums than others in providing postal facilities, and those facilities have been of benefit to the rest of Australia. I think we shall do well to give consideration to many of the points raised by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, which, however, can be better dealt with in committee. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the position of the people is altered. I do not think that there is any justification for the feeling of unrest which exists, but we are not going to allay that unrest by pushing on with this measure. Nor can I see that there is much to be gained by discussing this Bill when it is impossible for us at the present time to arrive at finality. If I am not mistaken, the "Western Australian representative of the Government has already telegraphed to say that it is inconvenient to attend a conference at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Surely there is no violent hurry about the acquisition of property or about coming to a settlement. If there is need for hurry, the members for the States will see that they do their part. I suggest to the Minister in charge of Home Affairs that he should not proceed any further with the Bill, because the whole of the discussion will only have to be gone over again, and we could easily proceed with other business in the meantime. It is objectionable in legislation to have a break, and to have to resume the discussion at a time when the thread has been almost forgotten. In a question like this which affects large interests of the various States, we ought not to have the discussion broken up by a conference ; it would be much better to wait until the conference has been held. </para>

                    <para>That is my argument. If we take over the post-offices we are to take over the obligations of the States in respect of the postal departments. One of the obligations of the States is the debt incurred in building the post-officers and all the paraphernalia connected therewith. If we take over the responsibility attached, it will not matter a fig what value is placed on the property, because we shall assume the responsibility as one of the obligations of the department. Section 89 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall debit each State with " the expenditure therein of the Commonwealth, incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance as at the time of transfer of any department transferred." </para>

                            <para>- That is so, because even if we do not take over the debt we take over the responsibility of paying the amount of interest which the debt represents. As a business man I say that, even if it were not provided for in the Constitution, that is a business way of looking at the matter. The honorable and learned member for Parkes said that we cannot keep these post-offices and. telegraph lines without paying interest, because if we rent them we shall have to pay the rent, and if we own them and they are mortgaged - which is precisely the condition of our large public buildings - we have a right to' charge to the States, as a contra account, the interest we pay on the mortgage. We can "take it as a matter of fact that the post-offices have been built with loan money, which bears interest. If the Commonwealth takes over properties built with loan money, we take the responsibility of paying interest as laid down by the Constitution, and consequently there is no necessity for arriving at the compensation to be paid. With regard to other properties, the Constitution is very clear that certain methods have to be adopted for ascertaining the value. I quite agree with honorable members who have argued that we can do nothing in the Bill to fix how we shall arrive at those values until there has been some failure in the arrangement between the Commonwealth and the State to arrive at a value. Until that arises, it seems to me absurd to frame clauses, except for any future transactions, regarding the value of these properties. Although I admit there is a weak point in my argument with regard to the expression "this section," it seems to me that the fact that no reference is made in sub section (1) of section 85, or the following sub-sections to any method of arriving at the value of the properties transferred with the department - the fact that there is no method mentioned right throughout the clause as to how the compensation shall be paid - and the fact that the Commonwealth has to take over the current obligations of the State in reference to the departments transferred, together with the further fact that the Commonwealth will debit each State with the expenditure necessary for keeping up the departments, all point to the conclusion that there is no necessity to arrive at the value, or to pay any compensation in respect of properties which are taken over with the departments transferred. But with regard to other properties not exclusively in the possession of the transferred departments, or any subsequent properties which the Commonwealth may desire to acquire from the States under section 51 of the Constitution-- </para>

I would not have risen but for the interjection made a little while ago by the Minister in charge of the Bill, with reference to the share which Western Australia may possibly take in the forthcoming conference. I should be quite prepared to admit, if the Government had had such a proposal before the country for some time as that at present entertained, that there would be some reason for the attitude adopted by the Minister for Home Affairs ; but, in view of the fact that the position which they now take up has practically been sprung upon the country at very short notice, I think it would be a mistake if the State of Western Australia were left out of the conference.

                            <para>- That is a small matter in comparison with the other. No difficulty would have occurred if, before the introduction of this Bill, a conference had been held and some interim arrangement made respecting the relation of the States and the Commonwealth in regard to the liabilities affecting these properties. But to take them over, and to provide for the payment of compensation without reference to the States, is, in my judgment, a most high handed procedure. I do not wonder at the States protesting against the shabby way in which they have been treated. The Commonwealth has now been in existence for more than nine months, and surely in that period there has been time to consult the States, and to ascertain their opinions upon this matter. The Attorney-General says that the Bill has been framed to provide for every contingency, but it seems to mie that its introduction before the holding of the conference is like loading a blunderbuss, and then asking the States under cover of it to consent to an amicable iarrangemei.it. That is not a British way of going to a conference. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. It might very well be omitted, leaving it to subsequent arrangement to make provision for modes and methods of payment. I feel that the States have a clear ground of complaint against the Commonwealth for the manner in which they have been treated. If a conference had been held, the Bill would have been passed with only a tithe of the discussion which has taken place in another quarter, and which is likely to take place here. But whatever delay and difficulty occurs must be laid at the door of the Government for their discourtesy towards- the States. I am unable - perhaps because I have not the requisite financial experience, but I am in excellent company in the view I hold - to see that this proposed airy, off-hand method of pooling the debts of the States until they have a common denominator is a fair way of disposing of the difficulty. To my mind, there is only one way of dealing with the matter fairly and justly, and that is for the Commonwealth to put itself in the same relation in regard to the properties taken over as the States formerly stood with regard to them. I think that in taking over these properties we should place ourselves in the same relation to the London creditor as the States now stand, and relieve the States of their liabilities. I hope that it will not be held later on that the acquisition of these properties is to be considered " new expenditure," but that it is part of what I might call the current obligations of the Commonwealth, existing from the time of the taking over of the departments. Surely interest charges are a current obligation. </para>

                        <para>- This is a very technical clause, and I think it quires a lot of consideration. The effect of the clause is that any person seised, or possessed of, or entitled to any land or estate or interest therein, may sell and convey the same to the Commonwealth, and enter into all necessary agreements for that purpose. Now, as a matter of drafting, I might point out to the Minister that the use of the word " same " in the phrase to which I have referred has no antecedent. It does not necessarily mean land, nor does it mean interest in land. Both in this and other clauses land is one thing and interest in it is another. I would suggest that it would be better to strike out the whole of these clauses in Division 1. </para>

                            <para>- I wish I could impress upon the Minister the fact that the second portion of this part of the Bill provides a far more easy method of acquiring property than is set out in the division we are now discussing. Under the powers proposed to be conferred in the second division of this part of the Bill, the Government may declare, merely by proclamation, that land is vested in the Commonwealth, and then adjust values and apportion the money amongst the parties interested. In the clauses which T. think should be struck out, the plan has been adopted of allowing the person with the very smallest interest to barter away the whole of the land, and such a provision is not only undesirable but is absolutely unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- The Government have made it clear in clause 43, but not in clause 6. I understood that the State was not to receive any compensation for State lands taken for the purposes of the Federal Capital site ; but clause 6 is worded in the widest general terms, and provides that the Governor-General may direct that any land required for any public purpose may be acquired from any State or person, and the words " subject to the Constitution " should be inserted there as well as in clause 43. Of course the Attorney-General will say that all Acts are subject to the Constitution, but if we are going to have the words " subject to the Constitution " in one clause, we should have them in the other also. If it is not intended that clause 6 shall relate to the Federal Capital site, the clause should have that stated on the face of it. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to agree with the honorable and learned member with regard to the last point he has mentioned. I will consider it, and at a later stage propose some form of words that will make it clear that this Bill is not to be considered as dealing with the Federal Capital site. That is dealt with in a separate section of the Constitution, and will have to be specially legislated for. I do not think it is well that our discussion on this measure should be cumbered by questions arising at every turn as to whether the provisions will affect the federal capital site. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but I think that the Minister will find that in the New South Wales Act there are words which limit the power of the Government. The Minister will recollect that there were words in the Act which some of us thought hampered the Governor in Council when he resumed the land at Darling Harbor. We thought it was necessary that there should be an appropriation, but I think the Ministry held that an appropriation made some years previously was sufficient to meet the case. So far as my recollection serves me, the words in the New South Wales Act empower the Government to acquire land for any purposes for which Parliament has provided the funds. That gives Parliament the initiative, and the Governor in Council must act subject to the parliamentary grant. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the Commonwealth will never voluntarily take up land, unless it requires it for some public purpose, and unless it has in its mind with some degree of definiteness what that purpose is. Unless that power is one of a very summary character, there is always a danger that prior to the moment at which the change of ownership takes place, the parties interested will indulge in a variety of negotiations. I have seen it done repeatedly in connexion with arbitration cases. I have been connected with a number of arbitration cases in New South Wales, where land has been resumed by the Government, and I have found that there is a singular tendency to effect sales of certain property in anticipation of the resumption by the State. </para>

                        (Northern Melbourne).I think the honorable and learned member for Indi has done well to call attention to this matter. At the same time, there is the other aspect of the question to which notice has been directed by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. On the one hand, we are giving a tremendous power to the Governor-General in Council. It is a power which is unlimited as regards amount, and, of course, no Parliament can refuse an appropriation of money to carry out a contract which comes within the powers conferred by Parliament. The Governor-General, therefore, can commit the Commonwealth to an immense expenditure without any warning. That is a power which has to be looked at very closely. On the other hand, the honorable and learned member for Parkes has very properly pointed out that if the Government have to give warning of their intention to resume land, all sorts of devices will be used for the purpose of inflating the price. At the time Haussmann was rebuilding Paris he adopted the practice of suddenly giving notice that he required a certain street. The idea was that he would come down without any warning upon a certain locality of closely built houses, and say - " I want that particular piece of land." By this means he thought he would be able to prevent devices of the character referred to by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. But he found that with all his care he was unable to keep his scheme secret. The very highest courtiers used to get hold of his . plans beforehand. They used to acquire the localities in which he intended to work or else they would sell the information. Then people would suddenly take up long leases of localities, and secure, as compensation for resumption, very large sums of money.

                            <para>- I am afraid there are not many tricks which they need to be taught in New South Wales. I think that the honorable and learned member for Parkes is right when he says that we must give the Governor-General in Council great power so that he may come down without warning and say, "I want this particular piece of land." 1 understand that the idea of the honorable and learned member for Indi is that we ought to allow the Governor-General in Council a power to appropriate the land provisionally, and if the Attorney-General will insert in this clause the word "provisionally" before the word "direct," the Governor-General in Council, if he finds that Parliament is not going to approve of what he has directed will be able to withdraw. It would be at his option then, and I think that the object of the honorable and learned member would be achieved. In Victoria we have an Act for acquiring lands for closer settlement. Under that Act a resolution of Parliament is necessary before the Governor in Council is authorized to conclude any contract. He makes a provisional contract, which is subject to the approval of Parliament. That is one way of doing it. I think that machinery enabling the Governor in Council to put his claw upon any particular land and to have the option, if Parliament does not approve of it, of receding from the contract would be the correct course to adopt. I admit that it needs machinery, but I am quite sure that the Ministry will be able to devise the necessary machinery for the purpose. If that suggestion is adopted, on the one hand we shall have the ultimate control, which Parliament ought to have, over the funds of the people, and, on the other, we shall avoid that sort of trickery which is continually used where notice has to be given before a contract can be made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Bill, as drafted, sufficiently meets the case, because, though it is necessary, as stated by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, that the public purpose for which any particular land is acquired shall be specified, it is easy enough to evolve fantastic public purposes, if Ministers desired to take that course. The clause, therefore, offers very little guarantee against jobbery. On the other hand, there is the unwisdom of hampering large public departments in respect of the acquisition of pieces of land of a small value. While the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would be appropriate enough as relating to land in regard to which large values were involved, it would not be wise to make it apply to other transactions. </para>

                        <para>- I fully agree with what has been said by the last two speakers. I have known of cases in Western Australia in which the Government have been involved in a loss of.' thousands of pounds because they were unable to lay their hands at once upon property for railway purposes. In course of time, no doubt, the State railways will be handed over to the control of the Commonwealth, and it will be necessary then to secure lands for the purposes of railway construction. I think, therefore, that the Government should have the power of summary resumption of lands for publicpurposes. </para>

Until the termination of that period, the purchase is regarded as provisional, but provision is made for compensating for temporary occupation. If the clause does not cover that, it will be enlarged to do so. That will cover what the honorable and learned member desires, and give honorable members all the freedom which is found to be necessary. </para>

                        (Indi).- The views expressed by the Attorney-General seem to meet the case very fairly if they are carried out in the clause. I observe that the New South Wales Act is very much more guarded in its terms. It presupposes, I think, in every case, that the matter has been considered by Parliament.

                            <para>- That the particular work in connexion with which the land is taken has been authorized - that there has been an appropriation, or that the Governor in Council has sanctioned the carrying out of the particular undertaking, and that the lands have been authorized to be acquired for school sites for example. In all cases, it seems to me, that the New South Wales Legislature very carefully, so to speak, considers beforehand the work in connexion with which the acquisition of land is to take place. I thoroughly agree with the honorable and learned member for Parkes when he says that when we take land, we must take it, so to speak, without warning. But that is perfectly consistent with the view I urge. We must give notice without any previous intimation, and we must provide that the value of the land when taken, if taken, should be the value at the moment of giving notice. All subsequent consideration is not to give a loophole for or afford an opportunity of affecting the value of the land, but is merely to enable Parliament to decide whether we shall take the land at the value determined at the moment of giving notice. That is all consistent with what I have said. We have carried out the principle in regard to many Victorian works. The Attorney-General knows that in the Victorian Railways Authorization Acts it is provided that when land is taken, the value shall be determined as at the beginning of the session or when the Bill is brought in. </para>

                        (East Sydney).- I would like to very strongly impress on the Government, in the interests of whatever Government we may have in the future, that they should if possible be covered by parliamentary authority in some way, and the land resumed under circumstances which will give them an opportunity of considering the matter with the assistance of Parliament. We know that when a Government, perhaps in the public interests, acts without authority, they expose themselves to a great deal of unpleasantness. Above all, there is the great principle which we cannot too strongly employ in our laws in connexion with the Commonwealth, namely, that no public expenditure or liability leading to public expenditure, shall be at the arbitrary discretion of the Ministry. What is the essence of all government ? It is that all expenditure shall be watched as closely as possible, and have parliamentary sanction before it is incurred. That is one of the main principles of government, and a very wise and salutary principle it is ; and if we are to observe it in reference to very small matters on the Estimates, surely we ought to observe it in large undertakings involving enormous amounts of public money. I am quite agreeable to any course which the Ministry may suggest which will give them power of prompt action, but which, at the same time, will not give any Government the arbitrary power of spending money without some sort of parliamentary acquiescence.

                        (Northern Melbourne).I doubt whether the Attorney-General is going on exactly the lines which the committee seem to approve. As I understand, the object of most members of the committee is that the direction shall be an appropriation of land, if the Parliament afterwards approve, and it is to be an appropriation as from the time of the direction being given by the Minister. The appropriation is to relate back,, as soon as Parliament approves, to the moment the Minister says "I want that, land." Most of the committee are anxious,. I think, that there shall be, as it were, a, provisional direction. The next point is. that it is proposed to have this provisional direction applied only to cases involving over £1,000, or some other figure. I do not believe in an arbitrary line of figures, because such rigid distinctions are oftentimes. very hampering. If a piece of land, worth only £25, is wanted for a country post-office, I cannot see any harm in applying the provisional rule even to such a case.

                            <para>- There would be no need for any delay, because we can make provision for cases when Parliament is not sitting. I can well understand that where a very small sum is involved, the Minister will take certain risks ; but all of us know there may be jobs in constituencies when even under £100 is involved. Members of Parliament are often faced with the argument that although certain expenditure is wrong it has already been incurred, and that it is of no use discussing the matter ; and I think there would be no hurt done if the provisional arrangement were applied to every transaction. In most cases there would be a contract made, and, assuming that to be the case, no hardship would be involved by my suggestion, because there would be an arrangement by which a person, who might be entitled to a small sum, would get interest in the meantime. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me, after what the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, that there cannot be much harm in carrying out the suggestion made by the Attorney-General. The limit may be made less than £1,000, but that is not a large amount to trust the Ministry with. We can insert in the clause that any expenditure above £1,000 shall hang in abeyance until Parliament has an opportunity of dealing with the matter. But I presume that what will be done in the Commonwealth in regard to Estimates will be what is done in the States, and that a sum of money will be placed on the Estimates to deal with matters of this kind. I suppose that a provision will be inserted similar to that in the New South Wales Act, where the word " authorized " or some similar word is used in regard to the money so voted. There was a large resumption of wharfage areas recently in Sydney, and the Government could not have carried out that resumption had there not been a vote passed years before, a balance of which remained unexpended, and which, technically, could be applied to this purpose. If there is a sum of money voted each year, there should be a provision put in one of the clauses, that the Government can exercise their power under that vote. In case there is no vote, an amount up to £1 000 or £500 could be dealt with, and afterwards approved. Any amount beyond that would require the sanction of Parliament. If that be done, there seems to be no difficulty ; and I will get the Attorney-General to prepare an amendment in that direction, which can be dealt with on a recommittal. </para>

                        <para>I do not think that it will be ultimately found impossible to get white men to do field work. I believe that from my experience in the north. I wish the honorable member for Mackay could get some of the timber getters and miners in the north who are exposed to hardships infinitely greater than can exist in the cane fields, and ask them if they think it is impossible for white men to do the work on the plantations. I have never met one who has not scouted the idea unless he has gone into some commercial speculation the profits of which depend on the introduction of black labour. I do not believe that in Queensland it will ultimately be found necessary that in order to carry on field work we should introduce black labour. </para>

Before five years are over, other arrangements of a more satisfactory kind will be made. We shall see some other system of agriculture substituted. Agriculture will be conducted by farmers working for themselves rather than by men working in large numbers for absentee employers. </para>

                        <para>This result is seen to be working itself out in the history of the past recent years. In 1885, the number of white farmers growing cane was relatively fractional ; but the number of Pacific Islanders in the colony was 10,755, and the sugar produced was 55, 796 tons. In 1898, as it has already been stated, the number of white cane-growers, in Queensland was 2,610, with the production of sugar increased to 123,289 tons, and the number of Pacific Islanders reduced to 8,826. The actual reduction in the number of islanders is. 1,929, but the relative reduction is not less than 00 per cent, from what it was in 1885, when the production of sugar at these respective periods is considered. </para>

It is also provided that during the year 1903 the licences shall not extend to the introduction of more than half the number of Pacific Islanders who have returned to their native islands during the year 1902. Then a further period of three months is given so as to allow those who hold licences to complete their voyages. These are the provisions of the Bill as to the introduction of black labour. But the principal provision of this measure is, I think, the shortest, namely, the 7th clause, which reads as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- I think we have the power, and as I said last night in regard to another matter, I will take the risk. It is clear that no Pacific Islander ought to be in Queensland after 1906. His only excuse for being in Australia prior to that period is that he is here under some agreement. As he will not be able to urge that plea after the date which 1 have : named, he- ought not to be retained in Australia. Being without the only excuse that can be offered for his presence in Australia, we take the power to return him to the place from which he was introduced, and I hope we shall use a little discrimination in that matter, so that he may be returned to a safe place. These are the main provisions of the Bill. It remains for me to apologize to the House for having occupied so much time. I need scarcely apologize, however, because I think it well that certain facts, historical and legislative, should be put upon record the first time that we touched upon this question. I apologize, therefore, only in a limited way, and I hope I have to some extent relieved those who have heard me of the necessity for investigating some of the more intricate points in connexion with these statutes. They may take what I have said for granted, and I may add that I have now in print a summary of the legislation enacted in regard to this matter, which will show honorable members exactly the provisions of the statutes relating to it. I thank the House for the tolerance and kindly hearing it has given me from both sides, and I hope to be able to say before this year closes that Australia will have this measure to accompany the Bill which we had in committee yesterday, the two together being not merely the realization of a policy, but a handsome new year's gift for a new nation. </para>

                    <para>- This is one of the clauses which I think is beyond the powers conferred by the Constitution, inasmuch as we propose to take over portion of a man's property without compensation because there is no damage done to the surface which is not taken over. We are therefore exceeding our powers, as the Constitution only allows us to take over property upon just terms. It seems to me that this clause will be open to challenge in the courts of justice. </para>

But we do so only in a technical sense. The point in dispute is not worth much, but I will reconsider it. </para>

If we have not the right to carry out such works, we must stop all the ordinary works required in connexion with' the buildings we control at the present time. If the Constitution does not give the power which the State Acts give, we cannot possibly cany out the works which are now being dealt with in the department over which I preside. I should say there must be a power, which, if not defined , is inherent, for us to deal with matters of the kind. There are provisions enabling us to deal with springs, reservoirs, dams, and so on, and all these are put in in order that there shall be no damage or injury done without compensation to the individual who owns the surface, though the surface rights are not treated as extending to any depth. </para>

                    <para>- Does this clause go far enough in the protection of structures ? There is to be no compensation allowed unless the surface of the overlying soil is destroyed, or the support of such surface is destroyed so as to seriously affect the land. But supposing there were a case where the whole surface had been removed, and a structure erected on the site. I do* not know that, strictly speaking, there would be compensation claimed in such a case, although the structure might be seriously affected, and there ought to be some addition to the clause to prevent a point of that kind being taken. I would suggest that words should be inserted so as to include the support of any structure either on or below the surface, destroyed or injuriously affected by the construction of public works. </para>

                    <para>- No harm would be done by giving the option between the High Court and the Supreme Court of a State. I have a strong view personally that a little postponement of the creation of the High Court would be a good thing. It would save a huge expense, and at the same time all, or nearly all, the work could be efficiently done by the Supreme Courts of the States as they stand at present. I do not wish to press that view at this stage, but I merely desire to follow what has been done in the Post and Telegraph Bill, and leave the Supreme Court of the State as an optional court. If afterwards when we are creating the High Court we think fit to take away the jurisdiction from the Supreme Court of a State, that can easily be done by a clause in the High Court Bill. </para>

                    <para>- I thoroughly approve of the suggestion of the honorable member for Flinders. I cannot conceive how it is possible to expect a Judge of the High Court to be competent to deal with all matters of land values, as such competency can only be acquired after many years of practical experience. However competent in other respects a Judge may be, it is unreasonable to expect him to have the necessary training to enable him to properly appraise the value of land. It would be much simpler and less expensive to have these matters dealt with by practical experts who understand the business. I do not know why the High Court was chosen as a tribunal to assess the value of land, or whether a similar course is taken in any of the other States. I have known Judges of Courts to sit as umpires in arbitration, but I have never known of a case of the disputed value of land to go to a High Court. </para>

                        <para>- I have been connected with many hundreds of cases, and I never knew one to be taken to court. There ought to be provision made for arbitration as well as for appeal to the court. Surely, it is not necessary to frame our laws in such a way as to find business for a High Court, and pile up the expenses for the people. It appears to me that the time allowed is unreasonably long, because the Attorney-General, if he were busy with other matters, might delay a settlement for 90 days. I can conceive of cases where the property taken might be the whole of the possessions of the family, and under many circumstances a delay of three months would prove ruinous. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Gippsland is referring to a subsequent clause. In regard to arbitration, there are two systems by which we assess the value of land in Victoria. If the amount involved is under £200, the matter is settled by a police magistrate ; but, if it is over £200, it goes to an arbitrator agreed on by both Parties, or there are two arbitrators and an umpire, the umpire being a County Court Judge. In each case the umpire is a lawyer, and in nine cases out of ten he has to decide the matter. Each contending party selects what is called an indifferent person ; but we know perfectly well that in a great many instances the arbitrators are really advocates. In many cases they are also lawyers. The result is that in almost every arbitration it is the police magistrate or the judge who decides. </para>

                <para>Mr. ISAACS. - My experience is that they do. In cases that are at all important, the parties if they are dissatisfied with the arbitration go to a Judge and a jury. I commend the Bill for the reason that it does not provide a double-barrelled method of arriving at the result. It has one method, and one method only. There is a provision in clause 15 that if both parties consent they can go to arbitration, but a Judge is not to have power to send a case to arbitration except with the consent of both parties. </para>

                        <para>- It can be done at a very early stage. I admit that the Victorian law at present is not to be commended, for it is extremely expensive. Arbitrations are far more costly than most people imagine. If I were a litigant and had my choice - I am not speaking from the lawyer's stand-point - I would ten times rather have my case decided by the ordinary tribunal than go through the expensive and unsatisfactory course of arbitration. I could name several examples within my own experience where arbitration costs have been immensely greater than those of proceedings in court, even with an appeal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and very unsatisfactory. I must say that a judge with expert evidence before him is the best tribunal to decide the matter. He is not there to do anything more than properly weigh the evidence. If we have a skilled man to sift the evidence, and do it quickly, I think that is all that is required. As a litigant I should prefer the prospect of having a Judge to decide my case shortly, sharply, and cheaply. </para>

                    McLEAN (Gippsland). - I must confess that my honorable and learned friend's experience differs from my own. I agree with him that when gentlemen of the long robe are employed to appear in an arbitration, they contrive to make it as expensive as a Supreme Court action, but where the services of the lawyers are dispensed with, as they are in nineteen arbitrations out of twenty, and practical men are chosen, the process is not only very expeditious, but exceedingly inexpensive. I speak from personal knowledge of these cases. I have known many cases in which no charge has been made by the arbitrators. I have acted frequently in that capacity without making any charge whatever, and I know many others who have done the same. The expense is not worthy of consideration. Of all the cases with which I have been associated, only one was referred to an umpire, although an umpire was appointed for each of them. How is it possible for a Judge to distinguish between expert testimony and that of some person who is paid to give evidence to suit his side ? Unless a Judge understands the matter himself, he cannot possibly distinguish between the two. I should not like a question affecting any property of mine to be left to the tender mercies of any Bench upon which there were no experts. Whatever confidence I might have in the honesty and probity of all concerned, and I should have every confidence - I say that without a full and intimate knowledge of the matter it would be utterly impossible for them to arrive at a satisfactory and just decision.

Personally, I do not object to arbitration, but I think it is a step in the right direction to provide that these matters shall be dealt with by a Judge, without a jury. If 1 had a case of my own, I should prefer to obtain the decision of a Judge. </para>

                        <para>- I should in many instances. It would depend very much, however, upon the nature of the case, whether I should prefer arbitration or not. I think the discussion is a little previous, and that it would be more appropriate on clause 14. </para>

                    <para>- I think the intention of the honorable member who moved the last amendment was to move the insertion of additional words, providing that a case may be dealt with by the Supreme Court of the State in which the land is situated. Might I also point out to the Attorney-General, as a matter for his consideration, that the value to be paid is to be made up of the value of the various interests in the land. I may be wrong, but that seems to me to be a construction that is open on the Bill. If we take the words " owners of the land," which are used in sub-clause (1), and the first words of sub-clause (3) - "Every person or State claiming compensation," we must see that they refer to various interests. The method of ascertaining the value is to take the amount of each person's interest in the property and total it up. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member for South Australia can scarcely mean that it is the deliberate intention of Ministers to create business for the High Court. For federal business we should have the Federal Court, and where the Commonwealth is a suitor, the proper and dignified place for it to appear in is the Federal Court. It was considerations of this nature that led to the adoption in the Constitution of the High Court as one of the institutions of the Commonwealth. Now, it seems to be argued that we do not want such an institution at all, because if the argument is correct in this respect, it is correct in all. I think the Government are right in adhering to their position that whenever the High Court is constituted, application should be made to that tribunal, but I also think that until the High Court is constituted matters should not be kept at a stand-still, but that power of application should be given to the Supreme Court of the State in which the property affected is situated. </para>

Under this arrangement, if a man in Western Australia has a claim against the Government for land taken from him, he will have to make application for compensation to the Attorney-General, and if there is any dispute as to the amount, the case will have to go to the High Court of Australia, which may be sitting somewhere in New South Wales.

                        <para>- Honorable members will be perfectly safe in agreeing to the amendment as I propose to alter it. It is proposed that until the establishment of the High Court, appeals may be made to the Supreme Court of the State in which the case arises. We cannot have a High Court without passing a measure providing for it, and the Bill must provide for just the kind of court that the majority of honorable members approve. It is possible that provision will be made in that Bill for the continuance of certain appeals to the courts of the States, and it will probably be decided that the justice shall be administered by the High Court in each State of the Commonwealth without putting claimants to any inordinate expense. </para>

                        <para>- There is a good deal in the remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland, and I agree that it would be absurd to take a paltry £30 or £50 case into the High Court. If I were administering the department as I am now, I should direct my officers in such cases to meet the individuals concerned, and though we could not legally appoint a tribunal to deal with the matter in dispute, no doubt we could arrange to get the opinion of two persons whose decision would be acceptable to the parties. But if the honorable member will allow the matter to rest now, I think we can arrange that only cases in which a certain minimum sum is 'involved shall be dealt with by the High Court. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne). - I have a strong sympathy with the view put forward by the honorable member for Gippsland. It is absurd to apply the whole of the complicated and expensive machinery of the Supreme Court or of the High Court to a paltry claim. I think the honorable member also alluded to his desire to allow more liberally for arbitration. In Victoria, to issue a writ costs only1s., whereas to issue a summons in the police court costs 2s. 6d., so that in reality it is cheaper to start proceedings there in the first instance. I think that there ought to be power given to the Judge, as soon as a writ is issued, to refer it to some arbitrator, who could settle it in a simple and inexpensive way. I do not think it ought to be compulsory for a claimant to have his case fought out before a court. We shall not be doing ill by leaving it optional with some authority to say whether any particular case shall go before the court or not. My experience teaches me that arbitrators frequently regard themselves very much as advocates, and ultimately the matter in dispute is generally decided by the judge or umpire. I remember appearing before arbitrators and an umpire some years ago in a certain case, in which they reserved their decision. I went to Hobart some time after, and as I was walking along the street a carriage stopped, and out jumped our arbitrator, who ran up to me and shook me by the hand warmly, remarking, "
                    I am happy to say that we have won that case." Any one who has had experience in these matters will bear me out that the amount of frivolous and unnecessary evidence taken before arbitrators is much greater than that taken before a Judge. I will support the amendment to clause 15 so as to avoid making it compulsory that all matters shall go before a Judge.

                    (Attorney-General). - May I say to the honorable member for Gippsland that I refrained from saying anything before with regard to arbitration, because I could not but feel that as a member of the profession my statements might be accepted with some deduction. My own experience - however short it may have been - was for a considerable time largely in connexion with arbitration cases. That experience entirely confirms the statements of my two professional friends. Those arbitration cases were longer, more expensive, and much more unsatisfactory than they would have been had they been conducted before a Judge without a jury. At the same time I admit that where one can get parties to a dispute who are sufficiently near to an agreement, or who have a sufficient knowledge of two men in their own way of business to place themselves in their hands, no better, cheaper, or more expeditious method of settling difficulties can be obtained. But that is not the arbitration that we know, or that can be expected under this Bill. In this measure it is the Commonwealth against the individual. The honorable member for Gippsland knows from experience that when the State is concerned a very different kind of claim is made to that which is set up between individuals. In this case it is the State that has to be protected, because the State is not treated as one neighbour would treat another. We have to assume, of course, that in the case of small amounts there will be an agreement, and it will be better to make provision to enable small claims to be settled expeditiously without the claimants being compelled to go into court. There is bound to be of a large margin between what is asked and what is offered ; and then there must be the professional assistance which is thought so disastrous by the honorable member. Under the circumstances, if we agree to introduce some provision by a separate clause, I shall be prepared to make the limit £250, under which settlement may be arrived at in some simple manner. W e shall then be able to leave the rest of the Bill as it is.

                    McLEAN (Gippsland). - The cases to which I have referred were cases between private individuals and the State. When the Attorney-General speaks of there not being a large margin between the amounts, I can tell him of one case where the claim was for £950 and the State, after having the land valued by its own valuer, offered £460, showing considerably more than 100 per cent, difference. In that case and a number of others where the margin was quite as wide, and much larger amounts were involved, the course pursued was for the Government to appoint some person in whom they had thorough confidence as a trustworthy judge of land, and for the owner of the land to appoint a similar person. These two persons did not sit down and take evidence, but visited the land, and, going carefully over it, appraised the value for themselves. They acted just as two principals, or just as purchaser and seller would act, and in nine cases out of ten they agreed without reference to the umpire, although they always took him with them in case a reference should be necessary. I have been connected with one or two cases in which evidence was taken, but what I heard satisfied me that evidence in such cases is of little value as a rule. Each person brings the witnesses who will make the largest demand, and I have heard a person estimate £25 an acre as the value of land worth possibly £5 an acre, and give as his reason that it was a beautiful site, where persons could tie up their horses and have picnics. It is very much better to get practical men to settle these matters as principals would settle them, because a person who is not a judge or an expert may be guided by the majority of the witnesses, which is not a proper way to arrive at the value of land. In most of the other cases to which I have referred, both sides have been satisfied, and the costs have been small, if anything at all.

It will be of extreme value to those who are taking on interest in the future of our mail services.

                    (Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - I have endeavoured to relieve the Speaker from the onerous task of reading the whole of this motion by suggesting that it should be taken as read. I think my honorable friend, the member for South Australia, will not, on consideration, adhere to his charge that if his motion had come from another quarter of the House it would have been acceded to readily, because he must admit that this is a far more extensive return than has previously entered' the minds of any honorable member to move for. There are 26 or 27 headings in the motion, and I would appeal to the honorable member not to go on with it to-night. I am risking my right of speech. The honorable member states that it only involves information that is in the hands of the Postal department. If he has any recollection of his own motion, he will know that in the second heading it involves the amount paid per annum during a certain period by the Imperial authorities as their moiety under the respective contracts during three years, and recent returns presented to the House have shown the impossibility of obtaining any such information without a very extended investigation. The whole thing will cost a lot of time and money. It will not help the honorable member in any of the purposes he has in view, and although I am loth to oppose the motion, I shall feel compelled to do so, unless the honorable member will consent to an adjournment to allow the matter to be looked into. It could never have been expected by him that this motion would come on to-night. There was one which went outside the category of unopposed motions, and I explained to the honorable member in charge of it, that if he would move it to-night with a slight amendment, I should not oppose it, so that it is by a pure accident that the honorable member for South Australia has been able to bring this motion on. I think he will consent to the debate being adjourned. I am sure it will be in the interests of his own motion that he should do so. With a view of dealing with the matter in the most peaceful way, I move -
