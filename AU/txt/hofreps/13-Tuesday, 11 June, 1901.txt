At the inception of a session such as this, and with the limited time left free to ministers for the preparation of measures, matters do not move quite so swiftly in regard to the supply of Bills as they do in the second or third session of a Parliament which has been in existence for 40 or 50 years ; but we are doing all we can to get these measures ready, and the Bills will be circulated among honorable members at the earliest moment possible. </para>

                    <para>- I would withdraw any suggestion of an objection to the amendment. I have looked into the matter a little since the consideration of the Bill was adjourned, and I think it safer to put in the expression, and for the reason given by the Attorney-General, that it might possibly be held - and it is doubtful I know - that the Constitution Act does not bind the Crown, that is, that the words in the Constitution Act do not extend to all legislation passed under it. The fact that the King is part of this Parliament does not necessarily mean that His Majesty will be bound by any Act passed in the Parliament. I think there may be a doubt about that. I therefore think it safer to do what the Attorney-General suggests.We shall by so doing give the same terminology to every Act; and if we wish those Acts to bind the Crown, that can be done in the measures themselves. As to the words, I think the colonial form is better than the English one. These words appear in the sections of the English Acts ; but I do not know that in the matter of phraseology we should be absolutely bound by that precedent. The English words are not always an improvement. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to call attention to the way in which the object of this clause might be accomplished, even with the excision of the provision itself. The practice in American drafting is that if there are any machinery clauses which ought to come into operation before the clauses dealing with the principle of the Act, it is declared that those machinery clauses shall come into operation on a certain date. They put that in the Act itself. </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to take the course suggested by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, because this clause, like many other clauses in this Bill, is introduced to cure possible defects of drafting. That is the object, although it is not definitely expressed. The clauses are introduced to provide against carelessness which should not exist in the framing of Bills. I agree with honorable members that it is better to state in plain terms on the face of the particular Act the exact time when any portion of it as distinct from the remainder of the Act is to be brought into operation ; and I should be glad to assist in having that course adopted in any measure that comes before this House. But, as honorable members know, some Bills may be passed hastily, others will perhaps be passed at the instance of private members, and may escape that strict scrutiny which ought to obtain ; while other Bills may be hurried through at the end of a session. The meaning of this clause is that if such an omission takes place in a Bill, litigation is not to be occasioned by the absence of the provision. </para>

                        <para>- This clause cannot possibly do any in jury. It provides for the absence of those provisions which the honorable and learned member thinks should appear in the Bill itself. I am inclined to agree with him. In cases where the provision appears on the face of the Bill, this clause will be inoperative. We can do no injury by inserting the words in this general measure, in order to cover any accidental deficiency. </para>

                    <para>- There is another point to which I would like to direct the attention of the Attorney -General. Clause 5, sub-clause 2, which deals with Bills reserved for the Royal assent, states that the Act shall come into operation on the day it receives the Royal assent, " or on such day thereafter as the Act itself prescribes." I understand it is proposed that in lieu of the words I have just quoted, the words, " unless the contrary intention appears in such Act." Assuming it was intended to bring into force an Act affecting, for instance, the sugar industry on the 1st of October, providing that no further black labour should be imported, or something to that effect, and the Royal assent were not given until November, then the Act would have a retrospective effect to the extent of a month, during which, people would not know the measure had become law, and might be committing offences under the Act. </para>

                    <para>- The difficulty raised by the honorable member for Sydney North, is one that might possibly arise, but it is very hard to conceive of such an occurrence, and still more difficult to conceive that a penalty would be inflicted, or any punishment incurred in such a case. If the honorable member's whole point is, that in the few hours elapsing between twelve o'clock on the preceding night, and the particular moment in which the Act is assented to by His Majesty, some offence may be committed under the Act, for which the guilty person is punished, although as a matter of fact, it might conceivably happen that the Act had not been actually assented to at the moment the breach occurred, then I say that that is a very remote case : and, moreover, the difficulty suggested by the honorable ' member might arise under almost any provision of the kind which might be made.Far greater advantage will be derived from certainty and determination as to the precise moment at which an Act begins to operate than there could possibly be disadvantage arising from the fact that within the few hours following there might be a breach of the law involving a penalty. I am certain that in any court of the Commonwealth, a breach under circumstances of the sort would be very lightly dealt with, if indeed it were recognised or taken notice of at all. There is, however, a great advantage in having one common and uniform practice, so that the whole lay public, as well as the professional public, may know that if an Act appears to come into force on a particular day, it does so at one second past twelve o'clock on the preceding night. The great advantage of a specific time under all circumstances, must outweigh the remote possibility to which the honorable member' has very properly called attention. Indeed, it would be very hard to propose the time or any mode of determining the instant at which an Act should come into operation that would not involve some such possibility as that to which the honorable member referred. As to the point raised by the honorable member for Bland, it deals with cases in which we must rely either on the foresight of Parliament in framing its Acts, or on subsequent legislation. If the case referred to by the honorable member is to be met, it must be by some provision so elastic as to cover the whole period of two years within which a measure may be disallowed. </para>

                        <para>- But the clause says " unless the contrary intention appears in such Act." Suppose it is laid down that the Act shall come into force on the 1st October, 1892, and that it is not assented to until the 1st of November of the same year ; that means a month during which the Act should have been in force. The date might be not that of the King's assent, but the date expressed in the Act, and that would be the " contrary intention." If the Bill said the contrary intention subsequent to the Royal assent I could understand it. </para>

This provision is intended to cover cases particularly in which an Act comes into operation under proclamation ; which would be at some particular date fixed by the Act, or which might be fixed by His Majesty or by the Governor-General. In those cases we have to provide that if the Act itself makes such a specific reference to the date in the future on which the Act comes into operation, then, of course, this clause would not apply.

                        <para>- It was pointed out that the word "enactment " was wide enough probably to cover State laws which may be said to have been repealed, either intentionally or unintentionally. Consequently, the clause in its operation would have covered a very wide area indeed, one on which it may be advisable to enter, but upon which it is certainly not desirable to enter in a Bill of this kind. It might have raised a question as to the validity of State Acts, whose operation had been for a time suspended by a Commonwealth Act - that is, whether when that Commonwealth Act was repealed, they should again be revived. The point has been discussed at great length in the United States, and there is a considerable body of decisions upon it. It was undesirable to leave it doubtful whether it was raised under any Interpretation Act. It was not intended to raise it, and therefore I have adopted the more inelegant form of phraseology which will put the matter beyond all doubt by the substitution of the word " Act," which has a special meaning. By confining ourselves to the word "Act" under this clause we remove the possibility of a construction which might otherwise be placed upon it. These clauses with reference to the effect of repeals relate only to their effect upon Acts of the Commonwealth, and have no reference either direct or indirect to the Act of any State Parliament.

                    <para>- I wish to call attention to the fact that we are adopting in this Bill different phraseology from that used during the Federal Convention and from the phraseology-which finds a place in the Constitution. In the Constitution the terms " proposed law " or " laws " are invariably used, but now we are dealing with "Bills" and "Acts." I merely call the attention of the Attorney-General to this point, and to suggest whether an additional clause in the way of interpretation will not be necessary to make this Bill on all fours with the Constitution Act itself. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. For my own part, although in the Constitution the use of the words " laws " and "proposed laws " has great advantages, I think that the words " Bills" and " Acts " are far more familiar to honorable members, and indeed to the profession. Consequently we need not in future measures be bound by the terms employed in the Constitution, which was an exceptional piece of legislation. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the word "law," as used in the Constitution, is not identical with the word "Act," because a law might be portion of an Act. For instance, many Bills which are called Money Bills, or under the Constitution "proposed laws" dealing with money, might contain a great number of clauses which could become laws, but which could not become " Acts." The fact is the term "Act" includes "laws," whereas " laws " does not include " Act." </para>

                        <para>- I draw the attention of the Attorney-General to the matter. Then there are regulations and rules made under Acts of Parliament and I am not quite sure whether the term " enactment " is intended to cover them. It is very difficult to discover the meaning of the word "enactment." I have consulted three law lexicons and have not been able to discover any meaning. The word is not in the lexicons. It is difficult to gather what may be covered by the word, but I have understood it generally to cover the whole of an Act, or any portion of it, or any thing under it which becomes law, such as the by-law of a local body, or regulations issued by the Governor-in-Council. I am not ready to express a very emphatic opinion on the point, but I would like the Attorney-General to consider it. </para>

                        <para>- I have found some difficulty in endeavouring to arrive at the precise bounds of the word "enactment." It was one of the valuable qualities of the English section that it was large enough to cover a very considerable variety of mandatory commands having more or less the force of law. But owing to the peculiar circumstances in which we were placed, by reason of the Federal . Legislature with limited powers sharing concurrent powers with many of the State Parliaments, it appeared desirable to part with gome of the advantages of the very general term, and to confine ourselves explicitly to the words of which we can see the direct result. Therefore, for greater caution, at the present stage we have substituted the words, "Act or part thereof.". "Enactment " is a very wide word. It is an advantage to use very wide words when you can do so with safety, but, owing to the peculiar relation of the Federal Legislature to the State Legislatures, it was thought better not to run risks in an Interpretation Act. </para>

                    <para>- In this State we are in the habit, and it may be the practice in the Commonwealth in certain particulars, to pass Acts 'whose operation is limited to a certain special time. They may or may not be renewed, and occasionally they have been very important Acts in regard to labour questions involving a variety of possible breaches. Although the time of the operation of an Act is fixed, the honorable member will agree that it would be very unwise and unjust if an offence had been committed in the last days of its operation and it could not be punished because the Act had expired. </para>

Take the case of one of our Factory Acts, which has been passed for three years only. A breach occurs in the second year of the operation of the Act; the appeal is sent from court to court, and before it is determined by the Privy Council the Act expires. The honorable member will admit that where a breach has been committed there must be a penalty, and the fact of the Act having expired by effluxion of time should not render the parties guiltless. The clause is intended only to declare a very obvious principle. </para>

                    <para>- I have all the objections noted, and might have called attention to them as we proceeded ; but unless honorable members revived them I did not think it necessary. This clause has been thought worthy of a place in the English Interpretation Act. This is an Act not only for the interpretation, but for the shortening of the language of Acts of Parliament. It unquestionably has come to include a great many declaratory sections which do not alter the law. They state the law as it undoubtedly is, and put it in this form more for the information of the public than for the use of the profession. </para>

As I have already pointed out, I am assured by members of the- profession that they find these apparently utterly unnecessary clauses of great assistance where an interpretation is likely to be challenged by an adventurous member of the Bar, who can measure the knowledge of the Bench with which he has to deal. The clause is contained in the English and other Interpretation Acts, and I think it should be allowed to remain for use by magistrates dealing with Commonwealth laws. </para>

They will be proposed private laws in strict terminology. If you call them proposed private laws, and there is no such thing as a private Act, then the terminology must be wrong.

                        <para>- No; it cannot operate until the Commonwealth has a seat of Government in the' sense of the Constitution; a seat of Government of its own, and absolutely under its own control. It may be used in immediate legislation, and the words are inserted to interpret a phrase which must occur in administrative and other legislation. I do not know whether the word "capital" may not come to be adopted; but, in the meantime, the phrase "seat of Government" appears in the Constitution Act, and it is likely to be used until the " seat of Government " is provided with a " local habitation and a name." </para>

                    <para>- I wish to bring under the notice of the Attorney-General a matter that has occurred to me in considering this clause, which must be of some interest, and which possibly involves a very important principle. There is no doubt that the term "British possession," when originally used in the days before autonomous government for the colonies was granted, was thought to be and was sufficiently correct for the purposes indicated in this Bill. But I think that we have arrived at a time when it is necessary to bring that definition back to its historical meaning. I do not think that we could in any way consider Canada or Australia a British possession in the sense of being possessed by the British people. These countries are possessed by their own people, though those people are certainly a portion of the British race. In our own interests it is very necessary that we should carefully consider this matter ; and for this reason in particular : Of late, we have frequently heard the people of India referred to as our fellow subjects. </para>

                    <para>- T - This definition of the term " British possession " does not oblige us to use the words in our future legislation; but I have adopted it because I find it in the Imperial Acts Interpretation Act, and because it will be convenient, if ever we use the phrase in any Commonwealth Act, that it shall "mean there exactly what it means in the English Act. I agree with the honorable member that, if we were referring to the great Dominion of Canada, to what may yet be the South African Dominion, or to this Commonwealth, we should seek more appropriate language than is here employed ; and there is a great deal to be said in support of his contention that in the course of time these words which, perhaps, were very applicable a century ago, have now ceased to be so applicable to a great portion of the British Empire ; but that need not deter us, if we do use the phrase, from using, it in its accepted sense. When we wish to indicate the broad line of. demarcation which exists, "and which must be drawn in legislation, between these self-governing communities and people who- are of different races from our own, inhabiting countries which are held under dominion by the sword, we can find sufficiently appropriate words for doing so without referring to the Interpretation Act. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes adopted, and the clause struck out. By using the word "Imperial" we are really abrogating our powers. 'The colonies were once non-sovereign States, and I suppose that it would be stretching our authority to say that we are now a sovereign State ; but we are a sovereign State to the extent that we owe our existence, as the Constitution puts it, " to the guidance of Almighty God, and to the creation of our own people," and that it would be quite impossible for any State which regards itself as above us to stamp us out. We have a separate and, to that extent, co-ordinate existence and powers with any Parliament that may choose to call itself Imperial ; and if we once give away the right of separate, distinct, independent, and individual legislation, which we now possess, we shall be making a very great mistake. I therefore move - </para>

                    AKIN- I 'do not think that it admits anything. I wish to guard myself in dealing with this question by saying at the outset that to my mind it is and must be purely a question of terms - a convenient collocation of syllables and letters to express a particular idea. I cannot admit that it will have any effect in any way upon anything that the future Parliament of Australia may choose to do ; but, since objection was taken to the term, I have ransacked the colonial statutes and some English Acts in the endeavour to find any word, or any two words, which might convey the same idea. I have been unable to find them. On the contrary, I have found, as I thought I might find, precedents for the use of the word " Imperial " in this connexion.

                        <para>- The term is used in our "Victorian legislation, and I find that it has been customary to use it in all the States in referring to the statutes of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which are described, for brevity's sake, as Imperial statutes, and may be seen so lettered on the shelves. So that we are not taking the first step on a new path ; we are following a number of footsteps which have already been taken upon it. What does the term "Imperial Parliament" mean in this connexion ? It means the Parliament of the United Kingdom, which is distinguished from other Parliaments throughout the Empire because it speaks for a sovereign state - which we are not - and because it possesses sovereign powers in relation to this and every other Legislature throughout the Empire. Under these circumstances the term is accurate as well as apt, and it points to a distinction possessed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. </para>

                        <para>- That is what I have found . It marks a peculiarity of the Imperial Parliament which is not shared by any other Parliament; and is, therefore, a distinctive term. The term has, of course, associations with which I am not enamoured; but, on the other hand, it has other associations which appeal to me, and, no doubt, to honorable members. Having searched for a better word, or for any word which could be used in substitution for it, I must confess that I have found none. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member is perfectly right ; he has called attention,. I will not say to the only class of cases, but. by far the chief class of cases that are certain to come before us. These are the references that will be made to the lands which will be acquired for the purpose of the federal capital, and which require to be acquired for the various purposes of the departments of the Commonwealth. For purposes of that kind it has been found convenient in New South Wales to use the one word " land " very shortly as covering all the estates of which it is necessary that private persons should be deprived in order that the State - and the Commonwealth is now in the same position - may enter into full possession of them. As the great bulk of the references to land in any statutes which one can foresee are likely to relate to the acquisition of land it will be very convenient to use the one word shortly. Then, in regard to the second sub-clause, I am unable after consideration to discover any reason why the word "lien" is there introduced, and except that it appears to be intended to cover certain easements or matters of that kind which might possibly attach to an estate, there really appears to be no justification for it. But I was fortunate enough to be able to have some conversation on this matter with the head of the Department of the Attorney-General of New South Wales, and he informed me that although the inclusion of the word "lien" might be looked upon as superfluous, yet in one or two cases it had proved to be of some use. Certainly on the whole the section had worked well with it, and he did not advise that the clause should be amended in any other way. </para>

Of course in the Supreme Court that word would be all right, but it might cover an information before a "court of summary jurisdiction," which we have defined in the previous clause.Indictment could not be identical with information in a subordinate court. The terms cannot be interchanged, and I do not see the necessity for using them as synonyms. </para>

If the use of the words be distinguished as it ought to be in that respect, no difficulty or injury can follow from the inclusive meaning which is here given to the word indictment. . </para>

                        <para>- This will be the primer of every draftsman of the Commonwealth. He will consult it, I presume, whoever he may be, before dealing with any Bill he may be framing, and he will take care to preserve the distinction to which the honorable and learned member has very properly referred. If this Bill has one purpose more than another, it is that of shortening language. The honorable and learned member must know a number of Acts .in which indictment or information occurs in section after section, and we have here a chance of getting rid of the duplication of terminology by using the word indictment only when we wish to cover information, while pains will be taken that it shall not be employed in any sense in which information only is intended. </para>

                        <para>- It would not include indictment. It is- intended that information should relate to information alone, and that indictment, unless otherwise expressed, should cover indictment and information, and be used in a great variety of proceedings which are common to both. That reply, I think, meets the point raised by the honorable and learned member for Corio. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member, as I understood, referred to the usefulness of th'e clause for that purpose, but he now thinks that the words " unless the contrary intention appears " destroy the effect of clause. But surely not. Those words must allude to the small minority of cases, and they are well understood. This clause relates to future Acts. It is to be the dictionary or text-book of the draftsman of the Commonwealth Acts. He is to use the word "may" when he means "may"; and when he means " shall," he is to say " shall." If the word " may " in some particular circumstances be employed, in a sense which is- in tended to be mandatory, the draftsman is to make that intention clearly apparent. Under these circumstances the clause is as much a direction to the draftsman as anything else. It is true that the law will remain the same whether this clause is passed or not. I do not pretend that the clause will effect any change whatever in the law, nor will any of the other clauses of the Bill. That, in the minds of many honorable members, will be no cause of complaint. They will be better pleased to have the old law re-stated than a new law made. But this clause -will be accepted as a direction to the draftsmen of Commonwealth Bills, and it also makes it plain to the inferior courts in which such verbal issues may be discussed, what is the purpose for which the words "may" and "shall" are intended to be used in our Acts. </para>

                        <para>- It is to remove the objection of the honorable and learned member for Indi, who pointed out that in certain circumstances the word " may " is used in statutes as if permitting a discretion, when, as the context shows it is intended to be mandatory, provided that certain conditions are complied with. To say that if such and such a thing happens the court " may " do so and so, means that the court " shall" do it, provided that those conditions are fulfilled. This clause is intended to provide against appealing to the set of decisions upon the word "may," and on the point raised by the honorable and learned member for Indi I have suggested the amendment. The clause will, however, stand for what it is worth as a finger-post ; and I do not pretend that it is for any other purpose. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to see this clause struck out altogether. The Attorney-General will admit that these words simply restore the existing law, if they do anything ; and they may not even do that. It may not be the context that guides you as to whether the contrary intention exists or not ; it may be a whole line of decisions. Because there is an elaborate number of decisions as to whether "may" is obligatory in some cases. There is also this further point - the words " it shall be lawful " have been held to be equivalent to the word " may " in some cases, and in some cases to mean " shall." The Attorney-General is leaving out the phrase - "it shall be lawful," so that the same difficulty may arise in the future. The clause is not comprehensive enough. It may do harm, or it may do good ; but if you do not cover the whole ground by including such words "as " it shall be lawful," it will be dangerous to keep the clause in the Bill at all. </para>

As I have already said more than once, the provisions of this Bill relate to future legislation. They can have no effect upon those ambiguous sections of the existing law to which the honorable and learned member for Corio has made reference. Their value in the future will be in regard to what we all wish to see, and that is a stricter use of the two words " may " and " shall," and a recognition of the difference between them. </para>

                    <para>- I should have said that many of the clauses do not come within the scope of the interpretation or even of the shortening of language, if we did not find so many precedents for them. It appears universally understood in the mother country, and also in Australia, that we may include in such a Bill as this all merely declaratory or machinery provisions of the kind which shorten Acts, as this provision undoubtedly does, by relieving us from the necessity of providing, when dealing with courts, that judges, justices, officers, commissioners, arbitrators, or other persons shall have power to take evidence on oath. If you endow them with certain duties, they, under the Act, have authority to administer the oath, and this saves repetition in, at. least, one out of every three or four statutes passed, and distinctly shortens the language used. The clauses, which it is intended to shorten, appear with wearisome monotony in so many Bills, that it has been thought desirable to insert this provision. Otherwise I cannot defend it, though, as a matter of fact, there is precedent for it, and, as it will shorten statutes and do no possible injury, I think it might be allowed to remain. </para>

                    (Werriwa).- The clause says " by consent of parties to hear and determine any matter, shall have authority to receive evidence and examine witnesses, and to administer the oath." If there be power to do that I presume there is also the power to call witnesses and enforce their attendance.

                    <para>- In the State of South Australia, the word "Parliament" is used to cover the two Houses. There the Governor enacts by and with consent of Parliament. In the Commonwealth Constitution Act, "Parliament" is defined to include the King. Why, then, mention him ? Why not use the word " Parliament"? I think it would sound better to say - " Be it enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, &amp;c." </para>

                    (Ballarat- Attorney-General). - In reply to my honorable and learned friend I may say that his proposition is one which suggested itself to me on my first consideration of the enacting words. It has the great merit of brevity and clearness. But, on the other hand, I thought it likely to come as a shock to honorable members to whom the familiar phraseology - " Be it enacted by His Majesty the King, with the advice and consent, &amp;c," to see His Gracious Majesty disappear into the Parliament, of which under our Commonwealth Constitution he is a member. But there are other reasons which might be worthy of consideration, although I admit that they are not of great weight. The enacting words, if the Parliament only were mentioned, would not provide for the possibility which exists under our Constitution in regard to the treatment of measures being properly expressed in such an enactment. It may be that, in some extreme circumstances under the Constitution, a measure would become law which had not been passed by one portion of Parliament, and therefore it could not be said that it was enacted by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. There is another circumstance, too, which, perhaps, ought to be recognised in enacting words and this is that the assent of the people of the several States requires to be given either in. substitution for that of one House or in indorsement of something which has been assented to by both Houses. In such a connexion even these introductory words may need some addition. It would then be enacted not only by His Majesty the King, the Senate, and the House of

                        <para>- But he ma,y so attend. The question is whether the King and the two Houses having assembled at the commencement of a Parliament, does not justify the assumption that they are " assembled " afterwards. There may be an " assembling " under three or four different conditions. The word is not wholly inaccurate, and it does not appear necessary to amend it, although I will give some further consideration to the question. </para>

                    (South Australia).- I think the honorable member for Corio is right. The old idea was that the King legislated, and the Houses subsequently assembled to consent to the legislation passed by him at their request. The Crown enacts the law, and then Parliament afterwards agrees to it: The Constitution Act, being an Imperial one, in its preamble follows the old terminology of enactment by the Crown with the advice and consent of the Lords spiritual and temporal in Parliament assembled as if the enactment is by Her Majesty. She is not assembled. She enacts with the consent of Parliament assembled. But we really cannot apply that to the assembling of Parliament here, because the three estates, King, Senate, and House of Representatives all constitute, by the Constitution Act, the Parliament.

                        <para>- No ; but the amount includes the expenses of a certain number of guests who came here as the representatives of other countries, and who were therefore regarded as guests of the Commonwealth. Provision is also made for certain expenditure which had to be made in connexion with the preparation of the draft standing orders. In the department of the Attorney-General only one officer is provided for so far - a gentleman who acts as Secretary and Parliamentary draftsman, though, of course he has assistance. His salary was fixed at the rate of £360 per annum until the 1st of June, and at £750 per annum from that date, with an allowance of £50 per annum for acting as draftsman. </para>

                        <para>- The whole expenditure. In my own department, I have a Secretary and three clerks. The Secretary was paid at the rate of £300 per annum up to the first of this month, as he was, until that time, drawing salary from the State, but since the 1st June I have had the whole of his services. I have provided £900 for the remuneration of officers in the Treasury and Audit departments of the various States who have been doing work for the Commonwealth. Those officers have done this work willingly and well, and the amount which we propose to pay them for services which have extended over a period of six months is not large. Those are the departments in connection with which there has been what I may term new expenditure. I will deal now with the three departments which have been transferred from State to Commonwealth control - the departments of Trade and Customs, of Defence, and of the Post Office. In providing for the 'expenditure of those departments, we have followed closely the appropriations which have been made in the past by the various States, except that in connexion with the expenditure of the department for Defence in Victoria, where a larger expenditure has had to be met because, of instructions which were given by the Minister for Defence before the department was transferred, for the supply of additional ammunition and rifles. The expenditure upon these departments is charged against the particular States in which it is incurred. </para>

                        <para>- That would allow a new expenditure of £20,000 for the six months. That would be independent of the opening ceremonies, the troops, and the elections. There is £17,000 for the Governor-General, Ministers of State, and Members of Parliament. Then I take one-third of the electoral expenses, and I may put it down at £23,000. That makes the total expenditure for the six months £60,000. So that honorable members will see that the expenditure so far, when we divide it and take out extraordinary items, has not been in any shape or form extravagant. .We must not assume because these amounts only have been spent during the past six months, that during the next six months or the next financial year larger sums will not have to be spent. Of course they will have to be spent. At the same time I think that the estimate which was made at the Adelaide convention that the new expenditure would not exceed £300,000 was an estimate which for some years at all events it will not be necessary to exceed, and I hope that when I have an opportunity of submitting the Estimates and a financial statement for the next financial year to be able to give honorable members full details of the proposed new expenditure, and that they will see that the Commonwealth is not to be the very costly concern which some persons have told us it will be. Much of this expenditure will be saved to the States. Where we have taken over State officers, as we have done in many cases, and made really very few new appointments, the States no doubt will be able to save a considerable amount. I know that in the Treasury itself we have taken over four officers whose positions will be filled by promotions and by junior clerks getting higher positions, and the result will be that a considerable saving will take place in the State of Victoria in that one department. The same thing will happen with many of these other appointments, and in future, where appointments are being made, the large majority of them will undoubtedly be made from the various State services, and by that means considerable savings will be made. It will be the desire of the Government to assist the States by every possible means to make savings, because we know that the State Treasurers will have a somewhat hard and a very uncertain time during the first year or two, in regard to what their revenue may be, and the amount that will be returned to them. Under these circumstances our desire - and I am certain that we shall be carrying out the wish of the' House - will be to make the expenditure as low as we possibly can, consistent with the position of the Commonwealth, and consistent with paying fair remuneration to men who are placed in important and responsible positions. These, sir, are simply the matters in connexion with the Estimates, which I desire to place before the committee. As each item is called on the Minister for the department will be ' able to give any further information which may be required. But I thought it wise, as there may be a general discussion on the first item, and as we have no real question with regard to financial policy to discuss on this Bill, which is practically only a Supply Bill, to give a short epitome of the various amounts, so that honorable members may have a fair idea of how the expenditure has been incurred, and what it is proposed to do during the balance of the year. </para>

I take this first opportunity, on the general debate, of drawing the attention of the Ministry to the fact that we have not yet had. any introduction of a Defence Bill. </para>

                        <para>- At the same time I quite acknowledge that these Bills which are laying the foundation of the administration of the Commonwealth, should be most carefully prepared, and that it is better to have a certain amount of delay than to bring in an undigested measure. I am glad also to see that as a matter of general rule in this Bill which is being now introduced the principle of cash payment, as we call it in New South Wales, has been adhered to. I see by the Bill that the items are dealt with, and the Bill says - </para>

                        <para>- The whole question comes up ; and the ground I take is that unless the Ministry appoint officers obtained from one or the other of the various State services, we have a right to know not only who have been selected, but the qualifications of each individual appointed to any of these high and onerous positions. That is one reason why, before I attempt to debate the Estimates generally, I should like to know the name of the gentleman who has been appointed, or whom it is proposed to appoint, to the position of Secretary for External Affairs. I should like the Ministry to give us the information now. In fact, in fairness, they may be asked to give us the names of all the gentlemen who have been appointed to offices, but who were not previously in the employment of the other States. As we have not a blue-book so far, and cannot expect one at present, we are compelled to ask these questions. </para>

It very often saves time afterwards. At the same time I do think that, upon the question before us, a great deal of work might be done on the individual items. </para>

                        <para>- There is not the slightest objection on the part of the Government to a general discussion upon matters of principle involved in the Estimates. There may be matters which could not be brought up on an individual item, and I think the discussion upon these .is not only proper but ought to be welcomed by the Government. But there are matters connected with the items themselves, which, to discuss now, would mean discussing twice. I ask honorable members to exercise their discretion in this respect, and not to deal with items now which will -come before us in their proper division. If they, in their observations confine themselves to matters of principle connected with the Estimates, such as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa was doing, I am quite sure _ there will be no objection. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that in taking away all the heads of the departments without the machinery for creating a new one, a very wrong thing has been done by the Minister. I am very sure that the three or four months that have passed might have been occupied by the Minister of Defence in considering what he should do, and he would have been much more able to do that if he had not encumbered himself with the work of administration. I do not suppose he was in such a hurry to blow up the Houses of Parliament, or smash up the Constitution, as to make it necessary that he should secure immediate control. We know that he is too genial a man for that. But I do say that it is a matter that ought to be seriously considered by the committee. I notice that the expenditure in the State of New South Wales has been £26,000 ; in the State of Victoria, a smaller State, ' it has been £55,000 ; and in the State of Queensland, with barely one-third the population of New South Wales, and not quite half that of Victoria, the' expenditure touches something like £22,000. ° </para>

Some remarks which fell from the honorable gentleman to show that the State Minister of Defence in Victoria immediately before the proclamation, and. some time during this year, knowing that the department was going to be taken over, did certain acts involving to the Common wealth increased expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- regret to hear that it was not in the power of the Government to offer them better salaries, because I certainly think we ought to pay salaries that will attract the best men. If in certain banking institutions and societies, such, as the A.M.P. Society, it is necessary to give the men in then- employ very large salaries to attract the best men, the same policy ought to be adopted by Ministers, and they ought to have made that clear to the House. Once they had shown honorable members that the larger sums were necessary I am sure there is so much common sense iri the House that it would have stood by them. Low pay often means bad work, and while members themselves may, for the sake of the honour and dignity of the position, consent to accept low remuneration, they cannot expect other men who are not sharing in the distinction of being members of the Federal Parliament to go and work for proportionately low remuneration. The best men will naturally go to the places where they are paid the best remuneration. I think that when we take into consideration the number of men in various private institutions who are offered very much larger sums than some of these, the salaries are clearly inadequate. I say this without any reference to the question whether the appointments are suitable or not. I am speaking solely in regard to the offices, and I say that they should carry with them sufficient salary to enable them to be filled by the best men in the States. I regret to hear from the Prime Minister that the salaries he thought the Federal Ministry could offer were so low that men to whom overtures were made in the various States had refused to entertain them. I hope they will reconsider the matter, and if necessary put higher sums on the Estimates. If they think they have not obtained the best men, I think they should still offer the appointments to those men who they think would be suitable. I understood from the Prime Minister that, in making these appointments, even if the salaries were higher, he was quite prepared to substantiate the appointments made, and that he was not speaking with reference to the amount of salary only.

Did I understand the right honorable and learned gentleman to say that the salaries received by the Speaker and Ministers of the Crown were in addition to their salaries as Members of Parliament1? In other words, is the Speaker to receive £1,900 per annum, and are Ministers of the Crown, with £1,500 as salary, also to receive £1,900? I thought the right honorable- and learned member only referred to the Chairman of Committees, but I understand now that his remarks had a much wider application.

We were bound to consider that Parliament might express an opinion about the parliamentary allowance, which, if we did not make proper provision on the Estimates, would leave them very poorly provided for, with, perhaps, a bare £1,100 a year. The difference between their salaries and the salaries of Ministers would then be very considerable.

Holding the opinion that the emoluments of Ministers would not be excessive, if they drew their salaries in addition to the parliamentary . allowance provided by the Constitution Act, and that if they drew both amounts there would be too large a discrepancy between their remuneration and that of the high officers of Parliament, ministers thought themselves bound in honour to place this sum upon the estimates to bo voted subject to the approval of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- By the wise discretion of Ministers a number of salaries were not allowed to commence until a later date than the beginning of the year, and thus a large expenditure has been saved. We have got along under shortened sail, and we have managed to do very well under the circumstances. The needs of the Commonwealth are developing day by day ; but if we are to take the experience which we have had, that is, putting aside the expenditure incurred upon Commonwealth celebrations and reviews, it will take us years to reach an expenditure of £300,000 per annum. Even if the new expenditure reached £300,000 a year, that amount would have to be shared among practically 4,000,000people, so that would be equal to only £300 for every 4,000 people. </para>

Since the introduction of payment of members in New South Wales there has been only one election in that State which could be characterized as penal, and I do not think that that election could properly be so characterized, as the object for which it was brought about was never carried into effect - reform of the Upper House. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but instead of reforming the Legislative Council the new Parliament passed the Land and Income Tax Acts. However, that is another matter altogether. I have referred to this return to show that, when an estimate of expenditure was made, forecasting salaries much higher than those we are proposing for the high officers of Parliament, it amounted in all to £300,000, which is a much larger amount than we are likely to reach for years. </para>

                    (Werriwa).- If we consider this matter as reasonable men we shall not think that the salaries which it is proposed to vote for Ministers are too high. We do not know what amount is to be allotted to the Prime Minister, but considering the number of Ministers, it is clear that it cannot be more than £2,000 or £2,100 a year.

                        <para>- I will not ask the right honorable and learned gentleman for the information, because I consider that it is entirely for the Cabinet to decide how the £12,000 which has been allotted should be apportioned. Even if the amount received by the Prime Minister came to a little more than the sum which I have mentioned, it must be remembered that the Legislatures of three of the States have fixed the salaries of the Chief Justices of those States at £3,500 a year, with the right to a pension if they retire after having acted for only a very short time. </para>

                        <para>- But if a Chief Justice is incapacitated by illness he can retire on a pension at any time. There have been very few examples of the kind, but still the provision is there, and when we find that in order to secure the best men for these offices the salary has been, and is being paid to these men, not with the approval of one State Parliament, but with the approval of three State Parliaments, it surely shows that the very Ministers who appointed them are at least entitled to some consideration. And if the salary of the Prime Minister were fixed at even that sum, and it secured for us the best man in the Commonwealth, I do not think that there could be any room for complaint. Of course there are some persons who assert that in Parliament the people never get the best men. I am quite convinced that while the members are not paid properly the people will not get the best men. I have never asserted myself that I am in favour of the principle of payment of members, and for a very considerable time I had very strong doubts as to whether it might not raise up a body of men who are interested in stirring up political agitation-- </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not; I am glad to say there are other men with the same amount of courage, and I shall be pleased to see them get up and express in public those views which I know they utter in' private. If the salary of the Prime Minister had been fixed at as large a sum as £3,500, we could not, seeing that three State Parliaments after full consideration, knowing that objection could be taken to each of the votes, had yet determined to raise the salary of the Chief Justice to that amount in order to secure the best man, complain that it was too high. These things are limited to a large extent by competition, and if it is necessary to pay a high sum, then it ought to be paid. With regard to the allowance that is paid to Ministers, we know that they have to give up the whole of their time when they are attending to their departments, that any business or profession they have must utterly go to the wall, that they cannot take care of their private affairs during that time. So far from Ministers making money out of their positions, I would, taking the history of all the States of Australia, ask anybody to point out to me men who have spent their lives in the service of the country, who perhaps have been in office for many years, and who have not gone down, so far as their personal interests are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking with warmth because it seems to me that with some men there is an idea that parliamentary positions are not full of dignity and honour. They should be, and when they are proper salaries ought to be paid. I with many others from New South Wales hold this view. I represent an electorate which is represented in the State Assembly by five members, to whom the State Parliament pays £1,500 a year, and on inquiry in Victoria, I find that a district is represented in this House which is represented in the State Assembly by men drawing as much as £1,200 a year, and they have the privilege in each State of attending to their own business. I unhesitatingly assert that to-morrow I would sooner sit in Sydney with no parliamentary allowance, than he here with the pay there is. I should be far better off. </para>

                        <para>- -Every man knows it is true. I see the condition we are going to drift into if we allow this thing to go on. Only that State is going to be properly represented where the capital is for the time being, because a man will not be able to afford to give up the whole of his time to parliamentary business. Why, sir, the A.M. P. Society, which only represents a certain number of men throughout Australia, actually pays more in salaries than is paid to the members of the Federal Parliament. The Bank of New South Wales has about 200 branches. I have no doubt, that if we add up its 'expenses, it comes to £1,500 a branch. Look at the very much larger sum it pays. We find that it it paying three or four times the amount which is paid to the members of this Parliament. If capital, which takes the greatest care of its own, considers that it is necessary to pay that sum, surely the people, if they want their interests to be properly looked after,, and to get the greatest care taken of them, will also find it necessary to pay a good sum to their representatives. I would be the last to allege for a moment that there are other considerations which do not come into play here. We all know that they do. We all know that the desire to take a share in the government of the country is one of the greatest ambitions that can take hold of a man, and that when it does take hold of him he sacrifices all his time and everything else to it. But I submit that, in view of those facts, the House ought not to enter upon its career as the Parliament of a continent by belittling all the great offices that men are to hold. So surely as we value ourselves of little account so surely will the people value us of little account, and so surely will we members be of little account. We should speak out and let the people know what we really think on matters of this sort. If the people as a whole are determined that there shall be no thorough representation of them - if they are determined to keep down salaries and everything else, then let them at least do it with their eyes open. Let them know that they will practically limit themselves to one class of men as legislators - to that class who have inherited the means to come into Parliamentary life, or who, by their own exertions, have accumulated a competence. We know that, as a general rule, men do not accumulate a competence until they reach,, perhaps, long past middle-age, and are getting into the "sere and yellow leaf." We find that this is the rule in a great majority of cases, and therefore the number who will be able to enter into parliamentary life in this way will be strictly limited. I have been led off a. little by some of the remarks which have been made to mention a couple of the' matters that occurred to me. I cannot but think it a matter for regret - and I say this with a great deal of hesitation, owing to my knowing both the gentlemen named, and of whom, I must say, I think rather well - that the two appointments that have been made by Ministers should have incurred the reproach of having been made strictly on private grounds. I refer to the appointment of the Under-Secretary and the appointment of the Parliamentary Draftsman. It does seem to me that in order to avoid even the breath of suspicion these offices should have been filled by men who had had a good deal of experience in the service of the various States. </para>

                        <para>- I quite believe that ; but at the same time I could not support any addition whatever to the present salary. I do not mean to say that I would not perhaps support such an addition as the payment of the fares by boat of those members who have to come long distances, in order to place .them on the same footing as those who travel by rail.. But I would not go any further than that. I hope the Government themselves will take some action in connexion with their own salaries as well as in regard to the salaries of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. I would much rather have had an opportunity of dealing with these questions before the appointments were made, because we must- all feel a delicacy in referring to them after the offices have been filled, and well and worthily filled, by gentlemen whose services on their intrinsic merits are probably worth a great deal more than the salaries attached to their various positions. But it is absolutely necessary that we should satisfy the people of the Commonwealth that they are not to be unduly burdened with taxation on account of extravagant expenditure, more especially in connexion with .the Parliament of the Common- wealth. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared at present to say that I agree with the hon. and learned member. The honorable member for Gippsland anticipated the remarks I intended making. I am glad that no amendment has been moved up to the present with reference to the first item ; and I am pleased that the Government have assumed such a very fair and straightforward attitude in regard to the question. I had heard it whispered that Ministers were drawing not only the salaries connected with their offices, but also the amount allowed by the Constitution to private members. I am pleased to have the assurance from the Prime Minister that that has not been done. I understand that the Government have submitted the question to the committee, and that they are willing to acquiesce in any view that the committee may be disposed to adopt. I join with the honorable member for Gippsland in expressing the hope that Ministers will not draw their salaries as members in addition to the salaries attached to their offices. I admit that, as a matter of constitutional law, they would be entitled without any further Act or appropriation to draw them, but I sincerely trust they will not do so. That is my private view. At the same time, I do not say that the salaries at present drawn are at all in excess, or are even adequate to the services of Ministers. It may be that honorable gentlemen on the front bench are entitled to larger salaries than they are receiving. But the question is one of political expediency - whether it is desirable that Ministers should draw, in addition to their salaries as Ministers, their salaries as members. The same principle is Applicable to the offices of President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives. It may be that the gentlemen occupying those offices are entitled to £2,000 or £1,900 a year on the constitutional basis suggested, but on the ground of economy, which has been mentioned in the speech of the Governor-General - where we were assured that economy would be observed in the various branches of the public service, and in the administration of the departments - I would strongly urge that the salaries of the Speaker and of the President should be fixed at £1,500 a year without the addition of the further amount to which those gentlemen are entitled as private members. It is highly desirable the amount should appear in some form or other as £1,500, but certainly not with the right of drawing the salary of a member in addition. The salary would be too high under the circumstances, and, with the honorable member for Gippsland, I am afraid that if we join at this early stage of our career in going in for high salaries all round, it will make federation unpopular. I am sure a large number of honorable members would be very sorry if, in consequence of any action of the House in its initial stages, we were to be accused of extravagant expenditure beyond justification by the circumstances of the case. The temporary leader of the Opposition has asked the Prime Minister how this question can be dealt with by the committee at the present stage. It seems to me it can be dealt with by the slight addition of the words "including the Parliamentary stipend" after the words "per annum." </para>

                        <para>- Yes, a footnote could be inserted with some indication to that effect ; but I would rather the proposal did not come as an amendment from any part of the committee, -but that the Ministry should take it into consideration. I do not desire my remarks to be considered as hostile, adverse, or unfriendly. I would prefer the suggestion to come from the Prime Minister or the Treasurer after they have heard the views of honorable members. I feel sure that, if the Ministry do this, they will strengthen their position in the House and also in the country, whereas if they acquiesce in a general scheme of high salaries for Ministers and for the President and Speaker, with the understanding that there is to be an increase of payment to members, it will be a disastrous move both for Ministers and those who associate themselves with them. </para>

                    <para>- As the Ministry have asked for an expression of opinion from the committee in connexion with the matter of their salaries, and the salaries of the President and Speaker, I desire to say that I indorse the remarks that have been made by the two previous speakers. It is decidedly necessary that the Commonwealth should gain the confidence not only of the Parliaments of the States, but also of the people of the States. One of the great objections to federation always was that a new national Parliament meant inflated expenditure, added to the already too largely inflated expenditure of the local Parliament. If the amount which is named for Ministers' salaries in the Commonwealth Act, and which, whilst it may not legally be considered to include the allowance of £400 per year, was at any rate taken by the people to cover the whole, that the payment is exceeded at the first stage of the Commonwealth's existence, I am perfectly sure that the fears of the people, which I believe to be unjustified, will become greater as to the extravagance and increased taxation likely to arise from the operation of the Commonwealth. In case the committee should be under the impression, from some remarks of the Treasurer, that the expenditure so far is very much below the estimate, I desire to point out that, whilst only £60,000 has been expended on the Commonwealth services herein dealt 'with, the whole expenditure estimated for those particular services by the Convention was £140,000 per year, or £70,000 for six months. It is true that only £60,000 has been expended, but that does not include a considerable amount of expenditure which would have been charged to the six months if the Commonwealth had come into existence earlier than it did and the appointment of officers had been necessary. There is some £15,000, £1S,000, or £20,000- at any rate, £15,000 - not accounted for in the expenditure of the Minister for External Affairs - that is expenditure for an ordinary half-year, or salaries which are only being paid, for instance, for a third of the time, and other items. Then there are railway travelling expenses for members, and a number of other charges, which will come into future half-years, but which are not included in the items before the committee. . Under these conditions we can readily see that the £10,000 beyond the £60,000 which will bring the expenditure. of the half-year up to the estimate of the Convention, will very soon be reached and exceeded. I will just point out, for the information of the Treasurer, how I arrive at this estimated expenditure of £140,000. At the Convention the total estimated outlay "was, in round figures, £246,000. Off that there has to be taken £8,000 for the Agent General, which does not appear in the figures which we have before us - £24,000 for the Federal High Court and Prothonotary's Office; £52,000 for public buildings to be constructed, that is maintenance and interest ; and £22,000 election expenses, which the Treasurer has already deducted in arriving at this £60,000. </para>

                    (Melbourne Ports).With reference to the matter of the salary of the Speaker I agree with my friend the honorable member for Gippsland in the remarks he has made. I think honorable members will recognise that the amount of the difference will be the amount that is likely to be spent upon the entertainment of distinguished guests and others, and I do not know that the Commonwealth will be improved very much by a lavish expenditure in that direction. . In regard to Ministers and honorable members coming from distant States I take an altogether different view. My experience has been that men who have devoted the best of their time, energy, and ability to the State as Ministers of the Crown have from time to time made demands through their friends on the Public Treasury that the public and the House for the time being have felt called upon to recognise. I think that Ministers' salaries should be in every respect adequate. They are not adequate. We pay our Commissioner of Railways £3,500 per year - I think I am correct in the quotation - and we expect the Prime Minister to be satisfied with £2,000. Let me remind honorable members, too, that there are quite a number of contingencies. When we come to go into the necessary expenditure that Ministers are put to, we will find that the- £12,000 provided for in the Constitution is considerably reduced. If we want the business of the country to be run on business lines, we will have to pay salaries adequate to the ability required to fill these various positions. I trust, notwithstanding the protests that have been made perhaps not in full view of all the facts, that this House will not adopt a parsimonious policy in regard to its important officers of State. So in regard to the allowances to honorable members-

                        <para>- I am not at all sure that they realized, as they do now, the very great calls that would be made upon them, and even if they did, I take a higher view of the matter than the fact that they ought to have known. That argument reminds me of employers excusing themselves for paying low wages. They say to their men - "It is quite an open matter, and if you do not like it you need not come." The people of Queensland and Western Australia have sent their representatives here. Those representatives find themselves subject to a very heavy expenditure, and their business connexions are absolutely cut off unless they can go in for managing them by telegraph. They are called upon to face an expenditure that I am quite sure not one of them anticipated. To say that their present allowances will be anything bike adequate to these sacrifices seem to me to be unworthy of my honorable friend. I have no hesitation in saying that I will support heartily at any time, both by voice and vote, a resolution to adequately remunerate men who come these long distances and make these great sacrifices. There are honorable members in this House who will not see their families for months. The circumstances demand either that they should have two homes - one in each State - or that they should incur all the expenditure appertaining to hotels. </para>

                <para>Mi1. MAUGER. - Honorable members will doubtless recollect that the history of low salaries is the history of inadequate and ineffective service. Whilst the amount involved constitutes a great deal to Ministers, it is of very little consequence to the Commonwealth of Australia. A matter of £1,200 is the difference really between what honorable members are entitled to draw, and what my honorable friend proposes that they should draw. I shall vote for the amount including the £400, and on the first opportunity I shall vote for a special allowance being made to those honorable members who come from distant States. </para>

                    H. GROOM (Darling Downs).My honorable friend, who has just sat down, has enunciated my views upon this question very accurately. I have always been of -opinion that even our State Ministers have been most inadequately paid. In the great State of Queensland, which is of enormous dimensions, and with most laborious work to be performed, Ministers simply get a salary of £1,000 a year, whereas the Chief Justice of that State, who has probably not three month's work in the whole year, gets £3,500. The Commissioner for Railways,
                    received £3,000 per year, and yet the Premier of Queensland, with all Ins responsibilities and duties, only gets £1,000. I do not give way to the honorable member for Bendigo, or the honorable member for Gippsland, with regard to necessary economy, but I am not prepared to advocate indiscriminate economy. I do not think the people of the Commonwealth for one moment expect, that in dealing with officers of the Houses or Ministers of the Crown, we should consider them in a spirit of parsimony. I would like to correct a statement made by the honorable member for North Sydney with regard to what he termed inflated expenditure in the States. I can only express the opinion of my own State, that there is not a single item on the Estimates that would ever bear the name of " inflated expenditure." There is too rigid a criticism exercised by members on both sides of the House for anything of the sort. With regard to the salary of the Speaker, I am of opinion that it should not be leas than £2,000 a year. Speakers of the other Parliaments get from £1,200 to £1,500 a year. The Speaker of the New South Wales Parliament receives, I think, £1,500.

                    <para>- It is very nearly that amount, at all .events. Taking into consideration the high and dignified position which the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of all Australia occupies, I do not think £2,000 a year is too much. We must rise above provincialism. We are not in a parish vestry. Let us deal with the question in something like a dignified way. The Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia ought not to receive a less salary than £2,000 a year, and I will not consent to the £400 a year allowed him by the Constitution Act -being deducted. Now, with regard to the allowances of members. An honorable member interjected just now that those members who come from long distances knew very well what the salary was when they stood for election. That is quite true ; but I told my constituents before my election that I considered I was making a dreadful sacrifice in representing them on the miserable pittance of £400 a year. I have in my possession, at this present moment, 22 letters sent to me for subscriptions, which would take away nearly £100 of my salary at once. </para>

                        <para>- Some from Queensland, and some from this colony. Now, look at another aspect of the question. The electorate of Darling Downs, which I represent, comprises seven State electorates, returning seven members to the Queensland Parliament. Each of those members receives £300 a year ; so that Queensland is paying those gentlemen £2,100 a year to represent the district that I represent in this Parliament for £400 a year. Then look at the sacrifice I have to make compared with my honorable friends in Queensland, who on every Friday can return to their homes by train, and come back again on Tuesday. Looking at the question from the point of view of adequate remuneration for services rendered, I say the £400 is totally inadequate. Honorable members must bear this in mind : That when the first Constitution was drafted at the Convention the salary of members was fixed at £500 a year. I know this from one who took a very prominent part in drafting the Constitution, that had he been present on the second occasion he would have advocated a salary of £600 a year being paid to senators and members of the House of Representatives, and he is more than ever convinced of the justice of that since he has seen the large electoral districts which members have to represent. If the Ministry desire an expression of opinion from honorable members, I have no hesitation in stating my opinion freely in this way. ' I think that the members of the Cabinet are entitled to draw their £400 a year in addition to the salaries prescribed by the Constitution. </para>

Why, if honorable members will look into the question they will see that there is not the slightest indication of extravagance in these Estimates. On the contrary-- </para>

                        <para>- To talk of cutting out the express provision of the Constitution Act, which entitles members to draw £400 a year, appears to me to be carrying economy to extremes. This is a message from His Excellency the Governor-General, and this committee cannot alter the determination of any of the votes ; but if it is suggested to put a footnote to the Estimates, saying that Ministers shall not draw their £400 a year, I will be no party to "it. I' think we should leave them all where they are Ministers are entitled to the £400 a year under the provisions of the Constitution Act, and I do not think they will be at all' extravagantly paid for the onerous work they are called upon to perform. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the Chairman to say that he was going to put" the various divisions separately, and I take it that he will then indicate to the committee that the question is that so much money be granted, when we can take exception to any item included in the division. While I agree with a large number of the statements that have been made concerning Ministers themselves, I do not think any man who has entered into, politics has made much out of it. From my short experience in it, the longer you stop the poorer you will get. At the same time I think that a number of the salaries </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to the honorable member ; when I do so it will be time enough for the honorable member to interrupt. It has been said that Ministers should be paid salaries and placed in positions equal to those of the Chief Justices, but we know very well the talent and the capacity, the erudition and training which must be inherited and acquired by a man in order to reach the position of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of any State, and we know very well that some honorable gentlemen who have reached Ministerial office are not at all in the same category. </para>

                        <para>-I do not think that the salaries which are being paid to the members of this staff are excessive. While it is necessary that we should practise economy, and while the Government service should never be made too attractive, we should always offer salaries which will tempt the best men available for the work ; but at the inception of the Commonwealth, we must be careful not to set an example of extravagance which may disgust the people with federation. We shall have enough difficulties to contend with, without giving the public the idea that this Parliament has entered upon a career of extravagance, and therefore I support the remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland, and the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, in regard to the need for economy in fixing the salaries of Ministers and of the President and Speaker. </para>

                    (Werriwa).- I should like to say, as a matter of personal explanation, that although the honorable member for Coolgardie has made it appear that I have stated that the salary of the Prime Minister should be £3,500 a year, and of ordinary members of the House £1,500 a year, I did not intend to express that opinion, and that my remarks have been misunderstood if I have been taken to have expressed it. I merely drew attention to the fact that £3,500 a year is paid to the Chief Justices of three of the States, and that in the State of New South Wales £1,500 is paid to the Ministers, and about £1,200 to the Speaker and President.

                        <para>- Another question for us to consider is whether it is right that we should deprive the States of their good officials ? I have been a member of two Cabinets, and have had a great deal to do with leading State officials. I have not found that many of these officials, who have risen almost automatically in the service, and have been accustomed all their official lives to departmental routine, have the capacity necessary for the organization of a new department. In many cases I would rather intrust such work to a business man than to an official. I shall vote for economy, so long as the proposed salaries are fair and reasonable, and although honorable members may find it difficult to do this, no one will be readier to acknowledge the pledges which they have made on this subject. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. I hold the view that the State should pay fair salaries, but that the State service should ' not be made so enticing as to make everybody want to go into it. I feel that the men ought to be paid salaries approximating; to those which are paid in similar positions, outside - no more and no less. The State has no right to pay any more because it is the State than a private businessman would pay. So I draw attention to this item as one of a number where I think a . great deal of money may be expended, and where, if we keep a watchful eye over things, a great deal may be saved. I propose to vote for high salaries for responsible - positions, and fair salaries where the positions are not so responsible. </para>

Of all the battles we had to fight when recommending the Commonwealth Bill to the people of Australia, 1 think the greatest was; that which had to be fought against the enemies of federation, who were continually warning us of the extravagant expenditure it would involve, and the constant necessity for increased taxation in the various States. We had it to-night from, the Prime Minister that his expenditure for- the six months ending the 30th June is a great deal less than the estimate placed be- fore the Convention. I do not know how he has arrived at his figures, but I have taken the trouble to check the estimate, and! I find that, instead of the half-year's expenditure being a great deal less than it should be in accordance with that estimate, it is a very great deal more. Taking the estimate placed before the Finance Committee of the Convention and leaving out the question of. interest upon public buildings and the margin for contingencies- </para>

Irrespective of the £52,540 for maintenance of public buildings which we have not got to pay, and a margin of £5 4, 1 7 5 for contingencies, the total estimate of the new expenditure of the Commonwealth, including the Legislature, the Governor-General, the Executive, the Civil Establishment, &amp;c, was only £193,000. In the figures before the committee we find, without reckoning £44,225 additional expenditure for defence, that the absolute expenditure under the Minister for External Affairs, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Treasurer, and the Minister for Trade and Customs amounted to £49,073. </para>

                        <para>- We come then to the salaries of the Governor-General, Ministers, and Members of Parliament, making a total of £66,513 altogether. The savings effected for expenditure we have not had to incur during the six months include four and a half months of members' salaries. Ministers' salaries are not included, because honorable gentlemen have held office since the 1st January. The saving on members' salaries is £16,000 for the period. The saving for the half year on account of the High Court is £11,500. The saving on account of the Agent-General is £4,000. The saving for the printing department is £6,000. The saving on account of expenses of staff is £5,000 ; making a total of savings of £42,800, or a total in all of £109,313. Taking the half of £1.92,000, the estimate for the general expenditure of the Commonwealth, we find the result is £96,000, or an increase over the estimate of £13,000. If we then deduct the £10,000 that the Treasurer just pointed out was extraordinary expenditure incurred in connexion with the opening of the Federal Parliament, we still have an excess of £3,000 odd - and a very great deal -more if we like to go into the smaller details of expenditure for the six months. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. The Home Office establishment, £10,000, is not touched. The Agent General's expenditure, £7,000, is not touched, nor is the Treasurer's expenditure, £11,000 ; and so on. I think, however, 'that during the past six months there may have been some extraordinary expenditure which could not properly be estimated, and perhaps we ought not to be over critical. But there has been a great deal of expenditure that has not been reckoned at all. For instance, take the Customs, Postal, and Defence departments. We have the use of the buildings for Customs and post and telegraph purposes, and I do not notice any item for interest upon those buildings. The expenses in connexion with these buildings will be a very heavy item when they come to be reckoned. I point to these matters for the purpose of emphasizing what several honorable members have said, that it is absolutely necessary that economy should be studied. If the greatest economy is not observed in every department of the Commonwealth we shall find ourselves in the position of being called to account by those whom we recommended very strongly to enter into the Federation. </para>

                        <para>-Undoubtedly, during the first five years. However there is no item in. these Estimates to cover that expenditure. Without touching those items at all, I may point out . that although a great many officers have only been in the federal service for a couple of months, and the cost of working the departments has not been very heavy as yet, the full estimate put forward at the Federal Convention has not only been reached, but to a trifling, extent exceeded. On the question of Ministerial salaries,, there is not a great deal of money involved in the idea of paying the £.400 a year to each honorable gentleman, in addition to the total sum permitted to be paid by the Constitution. The amount involved is a matter of £2,S00 a year additional. But one is apt to be influenced very much by the custom in the particular State from whence he copies. In South Australia, Ministers as well as the Speaker, the President of the Legislative Council, and the Chairman of Committees, cease to draw their members' salaries on taking their respective offices. In this particular instance no. great amount of money is involved, but if we start by winking at extra expenditure to the amount of £2,000 or £3,000 we must expect a very large total at the end of the financial year. Although the amount of £12,000 a year paid to Ministers is not in excess of requirements, still it was not expected by the people before federation was accomplished that that amount would be exceeded by another £2, 800, and that the total amount paid to Ministers would be increased to £14,800. I do not intend to submit any amendment on these items, nor will it be necessary for an amendment to be 'moved. The* expression of opinion from a reasonable number of honorable members will be sufficient to indicate to the Government that the course of action they have hitherto pursued' in not drawing then- salaries as members, in addition to their salaries as Ministers, meets with the approval of this committee. Indeed, the fact that they have not done so is an admission that the drawing of the extra salary would be to a certain extent questionable, and is a sufficient assurance to the committee that the same course will be adopted in the future. </para>

                    <para>- I confess I do not feel impressed by any comparison of the estimated expenditure at the Convention with the proposed expenditure now. We ought to treat each item on its merits, though perhaps hereafter, as a curiosity, it would be worth while to see the difference, if there be a difference. But if we find we should go to increased expenditure now, we ought to do it, and if we find we can reduce the expenditure estimated we should do that also. I must say I have sympathized with Ministers for the last two hours, because it is really very unpleasant for the question of their allowances to be discussed in this manner, and the sooner we pass from this subject the better. Considering the wear and tear which I see Ministers undergo in ali our Houses, and especially in Australian Houses, they are not over remunerated by what they have been getting, or what it is proposed to give. I take- it that the more we pay them the mo-re we may badger them, and' the more we shall feel free to give them a hearty critique when we find them doing wrong. But there is a great difference between the nervous wear and tear of a Minister and the nervous wear and tear of even- the- occupant of this dignified chair, or the President of the other House. Indeed, I think there is almost no comparison between the work. It is very awkward to have to speak about these' matters, but honorable members should ask themselves whether in a Minister's work - with a department to administer, and having to face the House night after night and stand the brunt of every evil that happens - there is not far more reason for big pay than in the case of a Speaker or President, who, if he have a good clerk to instruct him, has really no trouble, and has not his nerves worked on in the same way as Ministers' nerves are. A Speaker or President is relieved for a great part of his time by the Chairman of Committees, and while I feel as every honorable member must feel in speaking on these matters, I shall at the same time go for a very considerable reduction, if it be proposed, of the Speaker'sandPresident'ssalaries. I might ask the Treasurer whether, supposing there were an attempt, which I hope there will' not be, to attack the £1 2,000- which is asked for Ministers' salaries, he has considered that there is no obligation to pay £12,000. All the Constitution says in section 66 is that, until Parliament otherwise provides, the amount shall not exceed £12,000 a- year, so that if this Parliament, which has full power; decided that a Minister should only receive £200 his salary could be fixed at that amount So far as I can see the amount ought to appear on the Estimates and in the Appropriation Bill. I apprehend there has ' been no auditing of the accounts yet. If there has been, I cannot see under what authority the auditor has passed a vote of £12,000 a year, unless it be by virtue of section 83, which allows the Government to withdraw from the Treasury any moneys needed for the administration of a department. I say this for fear there should be an impression that this £12,000 is a special appropriation by the Constitution, which it is not. The Constitution simply provides that the expenditure under this head shall not go beyond a certain sum until the Parliament otherwise provides. That means that the expenditure ought to come under review, and if my view be correct, payments to Ministers ought to appear on the Estimates and in the Appropriation Bill. The payments ought to be discussed. We may reduce the amount, but we cannot go beyond the £.12,000 without a special resolution by Parliament. I hope it is understood I do not think that £12,000 a 3'ear is at all too much for the work Ministers have to do. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so ; as the Prime Minister says, section 66 provides that the amount paid to Ministers is not to exceed £12,000, whereas section 3 provides that the Governor-General's salary shall be £10,000, the latter being a fixed appropriation until Parliament otherwise provides. With regard to the salaries of officers appointed, I wish there were some means by which we could make these offices temporary until we have more experience of what the work, and the character of the work to be performed, are. We are beginning a new machine, and we do not know exactly what the parts require in the way of strengthening and support. There are some cases where a man's services cannot be obtained unless he feels certain of permanence, but if it be possible these appointments, or as many of them as possible, should be made temporary. We should wait until experience shows how the work will "pan out." I know that the making of such appointments was the origin of a great many sinecures in England. Many of these sinecures arose from the fact that a particular Minister, who wanted certain work performed, gave it to some man and promised him a certain salary. It turned out in the course of a year or two that the work was not required, but the man had a permanent billet, and when he vanished somebody else was put into the place, and so it went on. I think there must be some means, as we have not passed a Public Service Bill., by which we could make those appointments provisional, so that we might see exactly what work is involved, and what are the needs of the Commonwealth. I have regretted, in common with other members, the canards circulated in the newspapers for the last two or three weeks as to attempts of members of the House to increase their allowance. The first intimation I got of any attempt on the part of any honorable member of the House to increase the £400 allowed by the Constitution appeared in the newspapers ; and I firmly believe it was simply an attempt to create, -a sensation, no other sensation offering. But honorable members have come here knowing that the Constitution provides for an allowance of £400, and we ought to adhere to that allowance. In fact, I think the Constitution would not allow anything else, and I am very sorry that at this early stage of this Parliament there are already attempts made to degrade Parliament in the eyes of the people, when I am sure we shall all try to do our duty. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want to keep the committee too long, but may I say one word with regard to the contention that federal appointments ought to be made from the existing civil service. It is a matter which I hope will be dealt with thoroughly and soundly in the Public Service. Act. We ought to lay down some principle. It is the old difficulty that is continually arising in connexion with the public services of all the States of seniority against merit. It is really the same principle. If we go by seniority we knock against the rock or Scylla of red-tapeism, and if, on the other hand, we go by merit we fall into the whirlpool of favoritism, so that the question is whether we shall have favoritism or red-tapeism. On the whole my experience is- and I have looked into it pretty closely - that it is better to risk favoritism than to risk the deadness that arises from promotions by seniority. The great thing is to have somebody whom we can put our hand upon as being responsible. Let the Minister who has control of the department or somebody else be visited with the consequences of such appointments. It is only by enabling us to put our finger on the man who has made the mistake, and who we hold accountable, that we shall have a good and a live civil service. I have nothing more to say beyond to recur to what I opened with, namely, that it is our duty to disregard the estimates made at the Federal Convention. If there is money to be spent, and it ought to be spent, let us spend it, whether . it is in excess of those estimates or not. But if we find that we have so much for any particular post, and we can do with less, by all means let us try and do with less, and thus save the taxpayers' money so far as we can do so consistently with efficiency. </para>

                    <para>- During the course of this discussion, the question of paying a few thousand pounds a year more to certain officials and to Ministers has been raised. We are sounding the keynote of the finances of the Commonwealth for some time to come; and although it may appear to be a little invidious to have to discuss the gentlemen who are interested in this question, I think we have sufficient high public ground to make us firm in the resolve that, as far as we can, we shall not begin this first act of finance by anything that can be called extravagance. I am very grateful for the good spirit which has led honorable members, especially the honorable member for Melbourne Ports; to express themselves:in the way they have done in regard to members who have come from distant places ; but I for one hope that neither he nor any other honorable member will press any proposal to increase the remuneration which the Constitution. Act provides for members. I would very much rather that even the travelling allowance question, which has been raised, should be allowed to sleep, and that those who come from distant parts should be content with the remuneration which we knew was to be ours when we accepted the position. Dealing with the whole question of the remuneration for the high offices to winch reference has been made, I will say at once that those offices should not be judged by their money value. I hope honorable members have come to this House with a higher notion than that of obtaining money compensation for their services, and that we shall, having regard to our promises to our constituents, and for the sake of the future finances of the Commonwealth, not seek to increase the amount of remuneration which has been agreed upon under the Constitution. I do not accept the view which has been put, that some of these salaries are required to sustain the dignity of the offices. Dignity cannot be added to an office by the expenditure of money, but only by the due discharge of duty. I hope we will not vote the salaries of Ministers or officers of this House, the Speaker or the President, with the idea that they are to be expected to extend hospitality as a part of the consideration for holding these offices. If there is one danger in front of this Commonwealth it is the danger of extravagance, and we need to be careful of it from the beginning. I hope, therefore that Ministers will be ready to accept the suggestions which have been made, and will not ask that these salaries should be increased. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to see all these persons departmental officers, and not merely private secretaries. I desire to see them appointed by the Public Service Commissioner, and that is why I enter my protest against permanent appointments at this particular stage. I think that before we vote, we should know the position in which we stand. The salaries proposed to be paid . to some of these officers are in marked contrast to the wages given in some parts of the Commonwealth service. Cases have been brought under my notice where men holding temporary positions in the Commonwealth service are working for 5s. per day, but such instances as these can be referred to when we come to the Estimates of the departments with which they are connected. </para>

                    <para>- I think the inquiry made by the honorable member for Yarra is a very pertinent one. It is a matter which suggested itself to mv mind some time ago. Although we recognise that these votes are impersonal, that they are votes for the positions and not for the individuals, we ought to know at this stage what will bethe effect of them. We should not be prejudicing to a certain extent those who have not yet had an opportunity of offering themselves for the positions provided for. This is a matter which the Prime Minister might well explain, in order that we may have the assurance, to which we are entitled, that when the Public Service Bill becomes law, those who are in the public service already will be required to bring themselves under its provisions, and that we shall not have extra public service officials appointed before we have defined the provisions that- we consider necessary to place in that measure. I think that such an assurance from the Prime Minister would remove some unrest On the part of those outside the service at the present time, and obviate serious trouble in the future. I quite agree with the view that private secretaries should be departmental officers. In the Victorian State service we have been accustomed in some departments to have private secretaries for Ministers, but in every case these officers are members of the public service. They have been taken from their ordinary work, which is generally in the same department, at the choice of Ministers. A Victorian State Minister is not debarred from making a selection, and an officer of his department is placed at his disposal as private secretary. In most cases these are fifth-class clerks ; gentlemen who have made themselves qualified shorthand writers, while most of them are expert typists. They are able to materially assist Ministers in disposing of their correspondence, and their work really does not go beyond that. I cannot see why it is necessary in the Commonwealth service to have a number of private secretaries, with salaries ranging from £400 to £450 a year, who will be extra departmental officers, and who, for all we know, may be appointed by Ministers and subject to dismissal by succeeding Ministers - officers who will have no rights, and not be in the public service. Such a course would only result in the growth of a system similar to that in force in the United States of America. The Prime Minister mentioned that he was not in the position to offer salaries sufficiently high to attract the heads of the public service in the various States occupying positions similar to those he desired to fill in the Commonwealth. Surely it is not necessary that he should restrict his choice to the heads of State departments. I believe that in these departments there are numbers of men under the heads who are thoroughly qualified to do the work which is required to be done - men who are not hide-bound by the red.tapeism of which we have heard and seen so much, but men of initiative, who have shown that they have capacity and ability, and who would be not only an ornament to the federal service; but would also do solid work for the Commonwealth. I think that a mistake has been made in confining the choice of heads of departments under- the federal' authority to the heads of departments under the State authorities. </para>

                        <para>- Well,, that is an exception to. the rule which the Prune Minister has said must operate. I should like to see men taken from the State departments, if they are capable ; but I do not think that the- Commonwealth Government are bound to choose their officers from among the public servants of the States. We desire to have the best men we can get, and, to get the best men, we must offer proper inducements. I wish to see a fair salary paid to every officer in the Commonwealth service, and I hope that when the Public Service .Bill is passed, it will contain such provisions as will insure the best work being done by the servants of the. Commonwealth. Although it may be strictly legal for Ministers to draw their parliamentary allowance of £.400 per annum in. addition to the salaries provided for them by the Constitution Act, I feel sure that it was not the intention of- the Convention,', in setting aside £.12,000 for the. salaries of Ministers, that they should also draw their parliamentary allowances. </para>

                        <para>- A similar remark has already been made by an honorable member on the other side of the Chamber, but I should like to point out that the Minister has a private secretary to do for him the work which an ordinary Member of Parliament lias to do for himself. It is my experience that the private- secretary does, the work quite- as well as a man can do it himself, because it is mostly a matter of correspondence. I believe that the system of employing private secretaries came into vogue in Victoria on that account. I am strongly convinced that the House could not pursue a more fatal course than, at the inception of federation, to adopt any proposal that" savoured of extravagance: I do not say that the proposals which have been put before us are extravagant, but they will probably be taken by the public- as evidence that this Parliament desires to tread a path which many of us have assured the people would not be trodden- by it. There are honorable members who have told the people that if they accepted federation they would find out to their cost that there would be extravagant expenditure by the Federal Government, and others of us have gone through the length and breadth of the country and, despite those assertions, have assured the people that there would' not be extravagant expenditure. It was largely due to our protestations, which we believed to be true, that we could not conceive of a Parliament elected under the franchise winch was provided sanctioning- extravagant expenditure, that the people accepted federation, and I shall be very sorry if we depart from the lines which have been laid down for us in this matter. For this reason, and this reason alone, I shall vote against the proposal that Mir. Speaker and- the President shall receive in addition to their salaries their ordinary- parliamentary allowances as a member of the House of Representatives and a member of the Senate respectively. </para>

                        <para>- No ;. I think the position of Speaker of this House is very well paid in all at £1,500 a year. I feel very much inclined to vote for a reduction of the item, with the hope that he will accept his allowance of £400 a year as a member of the House. I would not like the impression to get abroad that we have come here to raise our screws, and obtain' money from the Government. We have come here with our eyes open, and if we do anything to increase the parliamentary remuneration, it should only apply to members of future Parliaments, in order that it may be fully discussed in the States, and the public may have an opportunity of expressing an opinion regarding it. </para>

                    MCMILLAN (Wentworth). - I wish to say a few words before the general debate closes. It seems to me that we have now a much clearer view of the actual position than we had at the beginning of the debate. It is very clear to me that this committee cannot at the present time interfere with the remuneration of a member as a private member of the House. Therefore, if we consider that a salary of £1,500 is sufficient for the President of the Senate and the Speaker of this House - and I think the country will think that that is sufficient - we must carry out the idea by reducing, as one honorable member has proposed, the item of £1,500 by £400. There is no other mode of procedure. Therefore, we must lay down the principle that the allowance of every honorable member is to be taken in all circumstances. Take the position of Chairman of Committees. There is only a sum of £500 on the Estimates for his office. In this case it is understood that he also takes his parliamentary allowance, because it would be absurd to suppose that he gave the whole of his time for the extra remuneration of £100. As regards the members of the Ministry, it is not competent for us to do anything. The sum of £6,000 on these Estimates, as one-half the allowance to Ministers, is in a special schedule, and is not covered by the message. I think that the position of Ministers stands on a different footing from that of the President of the Senate and of the Speaker of this House. Those officers have only, to attend to their duties for a comparatively short time in the year ; whereas the Ministers of the Commonwealth are very different indeed from the Ministers n the States, in that they have to travel all over Australia. It would be far better that we should give them adequate salaries than that we should be eternally wrangling over allowances and over appropriations which might be of a suspicious character.

                        <para>- I do not see how we can to-night in any substantial way, except by motion which cannot be moved at the present time, give any instruction to the Ministry, and I do not see how the Ministry, after this debate, can come to any clear apprehension as to what the opinion of the committee is. I think the proper1 way now for us is to consider as a body - if I might suggest it - that the statutory right belongs to every honorable member to draw his parliamentary salary, and if it is considered that the Ministers should not have that allowance in addition to their salary let a motion be moved, and I have no doubt, if the motion were carried, that the Ministry would bow to the opinion of the House. At the same time, I do not want my remarks to imply that I am in favour of such a-motion, because I feel that the position of the Ministers of the Commonwealth is different from that of the Ministers of any State of Australia. </para>

                    <para>- May I offer a suggestion to the Government in regard to Ministers' salaries ? I recognise that the first Ministers of the Commonwealth, at all events, are not over paid even if they draw, in addition to their Ministerial salaries, the allowance for expenses for £400 per year, because there is no doubt they will have far more work _ than their successors. I therefore shall not complain - I shall have no right to do so, because the law allows it - if the amount of £400 be drawn in addition to the Ministerial salaries. Honorable gentlemen opposite have a right to draw this money under the Constitution. I think there is a special appropriation amounting to £12,000 a year to be divided among the Ministry That was a general estimate of what would be allowed to Ministers. It can be diminished, but not increased, by Act of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is an appropriation of £12,000 until some action is taken by Parliament to the contrary. The necessities of the position justify that opinion. Otherwise the Ministry would- not have known how they stood on the 1st January, seeing that there could be no appropriation by Parliament for six months afterwards or thereabouts. I suggest that the Government should bring in a Bill to declare once and for all what the salaries, within the limit of £1 2, 000, are to be for the respective Ministers. That is the course adopted in Canada. I find that the Canadian Ministerial salaries and the .regular permanent salaries, are less than the amounts being paid to Ministers of the Crown in this country. We should, I believe, make a difference during the first year, but afterwards I would not object to a reduction by the amount of the £400 a year. During the first year there is .an unusual amount of work falling on the Ministry, but afterwards the amount could be cut down, and the parliamentary salary could be drawn with the Ministerial salary. In Canada, the 'Prime Minister has an allowance of 1,000 dollars in addition to the salary attached to the Department of State of which he takes charge. The Secretary of State in Canada gets 7,000 dollars; so that the total salary of. the Prime Minister of Canada, who is also Secretary of State, is £1,600 a year. The salary of the Minister of the Interior is £1,400 a year,' and there are other Ministers receiving only £1,000 a year each. </para>

The Speaker of the American House of Representatives only gets £1,600 per year. The Speaker of the Senate in Canada and the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons only get £800 a year each. I really think it is ridiculous to pay £1,900 each to the President of the Senate and the 'Speaker of the House of Representatives of .our Commonwealth, considering the disproportion between their salaries and those paid in Canada. </para>

                        <para>- But the Speaker only gets £1,600 ayear,and he practically "bosses" the House. There are, moreover, about half a hundred committees connected with the House of Representatives, and the Speaker has to,leek after Bills which number. from 12,000 to 15,000 in one session. If the United States, with its enormous revenue, only pays its Speaker £1,600 a year, surely £1,900 a year in Australia is a salary ridiculously more'than the position justifies. I intend to move that something be struck off from the salaries of the Speaker and President ; and though the law does not permit a reduction to be made on these Estimates of the salaries of Ministers, I consider they should be permanently diminished by £400 a year after the first year. Considering, however, that Ministers have the right to draw the £400, and that the work of the- Government will be far more burdensome this year than in the future, I do not see why they should not draw the full amount for one year. </para>

                        <para>- H - He will have to entertain a little. The social conditions of this country are so arranged that if men are not given a feed and " blow out " occasionally they are not satisfied. Let us be honest in this matter. I want to see political economy practised legitimately. I want to see economic justice ; and the very basis of democracy is economic justice. Extravagance in paying decent salaries is the very height of economy. Let me ask honorable members to look at the various Upper Houses of the world to-day. What are they but absolute dead houses ? These Houses have been " run on the cheap," and when men are blown out of everything else they rush in there as a last resort. When a man has worn his life out making money he wants to sleep, and is not fit for political business ; and when a man is poor and gets in there he has to get help. On the other hand if decent salaries are paid, and if men get a legitimate and honest wage for an honest day's work, they will not have to get overdrafts from the banks. They will not have to borrow from or be under the thumb of their neighbours, and will not have to clear out of the House when votes are to be taken on various measures in which gentlemen of wealth are interested. In my travels I have often seen honorable members "get the wink," and clear out when an important Bill comes up, because they were under the thumb of the bank. </para>

                    <para>- May I point out in support of the course suggested by the honorable member for Kennedy that if we allow the figure 5 to remain, the authority seems to go forth that we are paying at the rate of £1,500 per annum, although we are only giving so much towards it in the final column. </para>

                    (Kennedy). - The course I suggest is, I think, the proper one for us to follow. Now that we are assembled in the first Federal Parliament, and are laying down the procedure of this Chamber, I hope honorable members will endeavour to get some sort of uniformity in regard to the conduct of our proceedings. I prefer to move my motion in the way I have done. Until we get the amount altered from £1,500 to £1,100, I do not see how we can make the subsequent amendment of a reduction of £58. I intend to vote for the reduction of £400 in the salaries of the Speaker and President of the two Houses, but I consider that the position occupied by Ministers is totally dissimilar. I do not by this vote commit myself to supporting a reduction of Ministers' salaries.

                        <para>- These Estimates only cover for the period terminating at the end of June. Then the Treasurer brings in his financial statement. If we allow this salary to pass now, it seems to me that the amount set down in these Estimates will bethe salary which the Clerk of Parliaments is going to receive during the remainder of his tenure of office. It is a permanent appointment, and while, of course, the House of Representatives reserves to itself the right on all occasions in reviewing the Estimates to either increase or reduce them as it thinks proper, I certainly am of opinion that at the present time £900 a year is too much. I feel inclined to move that the amount be reduced at the very least by £100. I do not think that the work required to be performed is worth more than £800, and I believe the Clerk of Parliaments will be well paid at that. I move - </para>

We were paying £1,200 a year to the Clerk of the Victorian Legislative Council, and we are paying £1,000 a year to the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of this State. Here is the position of the Clerk of the Federal Parliament of Australia, and it is proposed to reduce it to a less lucrative position than that in one of our State Houses. </para>

                    (Bland).- Some of the arguments used by the honorable gentleman are beside the question. The amount paid in New South Wales to the Clerk of Parliaments is £740. The amount paid to the Clerk of the Assembly is £820. The amount of work and the hours of sitting in the State Parliaments in all probability will be much greater than in this Parliament after the first session.

                        <para>- As far as the work that gentleman has to. perform is concerned, I think he is worth the money he is paid, and I speak after some years, of experience. I would point out, too, that - apart from any comparison between the amount of work done in this Parliament and that done in the various State Parliaments - there is a distinction between the work likely to be done in the other branch of the Legislature and in this House. Already the senators are sitting one day a week less than we are, and with their smaller number of members - they have roughly half the number - the probability is that there will not be quite such long sittings. The fact that they are restricted to some extent with respect to Money Bills will again tend to shorten discussion, so that on the whole it does not seem to me that there is nearly the same amount of work for the officers of the other Chamber as for the officers of this Chamber. It is no argument for the Prime Minister after the House has unanimously voted against the principle to say that we must consider the honour and dignity of the officers. </para>

                        <para>- I understood the right honorable and learned gentleman to refer to the officers. We laid that sentiment aside in the case of the Speaker, and I do not see that there is any more dignity to be kept up in the case of the gentleman who acts as Clerk for the other branch of the Legislature. I think that £800 for the Clerk of the Senate - because although he is dignified by the name of Clerk of Parliaments he is really Clerk of the Senate - is quite a sufficient salary. </para>

                    <para>
                        (Hunter- Minister for External Affairs). - So far as the Upper House is concerned, the salary of the Clerk Assistant in Victoria is £600 per annum, while in New South Wales it is £560 per annum. As to the House of Representatives, the salary attaching to the corresponding position in New South Wales is £730 per annum. I have not the figures for Victoria by me, but the salary is somewhere about the same. The case of
                        Duffy is one of those in which, as I intimated, there was a difficulty in obtaining the services of gentlemen of great experience and ability.
                        was in the position of Clerk Assistant in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and he was receiving £850 per annum. In his present position he submits, for the sake of serving under the Commonwealth, to a reduction of £100 per annum.

                        (Melbourne Ports). - I should like to know whether the Government in, making these appointments, have not had an understanding which is practically, an honorable agreement with the gentlemen who accepted .these offices, that the salaries provided for in these Estimates would be the salaries paid. These appointments had to be made. The best officers procurable had to be appointed, and it seems to mc, that whatever we may do as to future items, we certainly ought not to repudiate an honorable agreement made by the Government.

                        <para>- The honorable member is perfectly right. These gentlemen, as pointed out, had salaries allotted to them, but of course, notwithstanding that fact, it is the right of Parliament to reduce those salaries. No doubt, the gentlemen who have been appointed have believed, in accepting these positions, that Parliament will confirm the salaries which the Government - especially in the circumstances, as a first Government for a first Parliament - have allotted to them. Nevertheless, that does not destroy the right of Parliament, however much it may, in the opinion of honorable members, aB it does in my opinion, render the case on unusual one. In the peculiar circumstances I think Parliament might well confirm the decision of the Government. </para>

Had I not heard it, I should have voted with the honorable member who proposed to reduce the amount, but as there has been an understanding of that kind, and as the gentleman is receiving less than he received before I should not now like to vote against the item.
