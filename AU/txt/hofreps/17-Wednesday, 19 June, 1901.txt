                            <para>- In reference to infants and persons outside the Commonwealth, the six years will not run against them until the disability has been removed. Then we have to deal with the payment of moneys, and here we follow out the ordinary practice in that the money is paid under warrant. ' The Treasurer desiring to spend any money prepares a statement of what he thinks he will require during a certain period of time. . In the States this is during one month, but here we ask that the statement may be made for a period of three months at a time, because it will take some considerable time to obtain information from the different States. We think it is well we should have a supply from time to time which will carry us on for the period of three months. That statement is prepared by the Treasurer, and following the Appropriation Act or the Loan Act, sets out in detail the purposes for which the money is required. This statement is sent to the Auditor-General, and his duty is to ascertain if the money is legally available for and applicable to the various services and purposes set out in the proposed warrant. If the Auditor-General is satisfied, he signs the warrant, which is then returned to the Treasurer, and submitted to the Governor-General for signature, and the Governor-General will no doubt sign on that certificate. If, on the other hand, the Auditor-General does not consider the money is legally available or applicable to the purposes named, he has power to refuse to sign the warrant, and if he does not sign, that warrant cannot be signed by the Governor-General. I did consider whether the Government should not have the power of asking the Governor to sign although the Auditor-General might have refused to give the certificate, but on the whole I thought it wiser that the Auditor-General should have control, and the power of saying whether money ought to be spent - not the amounts that ought to be provided, but whether Parliament had provided the money for the proposed expenditure. If we left that power to the Government of the day, it would place the Governor in a very invidious position. He would on the one hand have the certificate of the Auditor-General that the money ought not to be expended, as not being legally available or applicable to certain purposes; while on the other hand he would have the Government presenting to him a document and advising him to sign it. . In most cases the Governor, of course, would practically be forced to sign the document, notwithstanding the certificate of the Auditor-General that, he ought not to sign. Under these circumstances, I have followed the practice of Victoria, which has always worked well, of allowing the Auditor-General to be the arbiter as to whether money is legally available for the purposes to which it is proposed to apply it. The warrant having been signed by the Auditor-General and the Governor, the Treasurer is in the position to draw on the public accounts. That he does either by paying accounts direct from the Treasury, or by lodging money in an official account, in one or other of the banks, to the credit of a public accountant, or by making advances to a public accountant for the purpose, or, in extreme cases, where it may be necessary, asking the bank to allow an overdraft for the time being. In the last-mentioned case, and in the case of advances, the various accounts have to be sent by the public accountant to the Treasury,, and the public accountant then gets reimbursed the amount he has expended, so that he always has a balance on which he can work. Following on these provisions we provide in clause 33 for the detailed manner of making payments. Officers are appointed who have to certify that the amount appropriated by Parliament will not be exceeded by the payments in question, and that the accounts have been properly authorized - -that that they are paid under the law or under some regulation, or that they have been specially directed to be paid by the Treasurer, and are, in all cases, within the terms of the Appropriation Act. These officers have also to see that the accounts are correct, and that they are charged to the proper head of expenditure. Receipts have to be taken for all amounts expended, but we have adopted a somewhat novel practice in sub-clause 7 of clause 33. By this sub-clause, any person who has any claim against the Government, when he sends in his account, will be able to request that an order for payment may be sent to him. After the account is passed and ready for payment, an order on the Treasurer - -practically a cheque on the Treasury - will be sent to him, and after that has been signed by him, it is payable to any person who presents it. Very often in country districts complaints arise in regard to delays in payment, but we think that under this new system, which we can try, or not, as the Treasurer deems advisable, we shall have power to expedite the payment of accounts. As soon as any one receives his order and signs it and pays it into a bank, the bank will in all probability treat it as an ordinary . cheque, . and allow a person who has claims against the Government to draw against it what he requires for his business purposes. </para>

                            <para>- No. In some States there is the practice under which a person receipts his account before he receives the money. But that we think an unwise procedure, and one which if it were tested in a court might be held, as known practice, not to bind. Under that practice a man sends in the account receipted, and afterwards a cheque is posted to him. In New Zealand there is another practice - there accounts are sent to a public officer and a cheque is sent to the claimant who has to go to the Government officer and sign a receipt, when he gets the cheque countersigned. That, of course, is somewhat cumbersome, and we think the system by which a man will be able practically to draw a cheque on the Treasurer is one that we might try, and, if it works well, adopt. If any difficulties arise it will always be optional to the Treasurer to discontinue the practice. In Western Australia, in that one State only, they provide that the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, which the Treasurer presents once a year, shall be laid on the table of both Houses of Parliament. Here, we think, seeing the constitution of the Senate, that it is wise that the fullest information should be given to that body with regard to proposed expenditure, and therefore at the same time that the Estimates of receipts and expenditure for the year are presented to the House of Representatives, the same document will be presented to the Senate. The mere fact of doing this does not in any way enlarge the Senate's constitutional powers whatever they may be, and as a matter of fact State- Parliaments do year by year place before Upper Houses in the various States the Auditor-General's reports on the finances, setting out the whole of the expenditure. I therefore think it a wise step to give the fullest information to both Houses as to what amount of money the </para>

                            <para>- No. The clause concludes - " Such Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure shall also be presented to the Senate." Then, in many of the States they close the financial year on the 30th June. Nominally, the financial year does close on that day, but in some States, for a period of two months or three months, and in some cases three days or ten days, the Treasurer can go on making payments and charging them against the previous year. The practice in Victoria has been to keep the accounts open for a period of two months, during which payments can be made and debited to the accounts of the year just closed. That system, however, cannot be adopted in regard to the Commonwealth accounts, because at the end of each month, for a period of five years and probably afterwards, the Commonwealth Treasurer has to pay over to the States the amounts to which they are entitled. On the 30th June, therefore, the Treasurer will have paid over the balance, and any payments he may make in July or August will be payments out of the revenue of the following year. In this Bill therefore we have adopted what is called the cash system, by which accounts are absolutely closed on the 30th June. But to prevent a practice which might be adopted of carrying forward payments to the next year, so as to avoid having too heavy an expenditure in any one year, it is provided in a clause taken from the New Zealand Act, that any claims outstanding at the end of the financial year must be shown to the Auditor-General by the Treasurer. The various Ministers have to furnish the Treasurer with the information, and that information is put before Parliament by the Auditor-General in his annual report. So that Parliament has an opportunity of knowing whether the Treasurer is endeavouring to hide a deficit by carrying forward considerable payments to the following year. That is clause 35. Clause 36 is adopted from the practice of New Zealand and New South Wales. Its purpose is to enable the Treasurer to carry on for one month without obtaining a Supply Bill from Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member surely realizes that it would be almost impossible to get the Estimates passed and the Appropriation Bill put through Parliament before the end of July. These things generally come at the -end of a session. At one time I thought that the Victorian Parliament should have an opportunity of scrutinizing every shilling of proposed expenditure upon the Estimates, and I tried to arrange for that by bringing on the Estimates earlier in the session. But I found that if I persisted in that course every year I should not be able to get any legislation done. Of course, the Estimates are not generally dealt with by Parliament until a considerable amount of money has been expended, and that course can betaken only under the authority of a Supply Bill. The power I am now dealing with applies only so long as the Treasurer does not authorize any new expenditure, and so long as the amounts are not expended under any new principle. </para>

                            <para>-I think I shall have to ask Parliament for Supply for three months, which will carry us on until the time when the Appropriation Act can be passed. If Parliament meets early in the year - in February or March - the work might be expedited to such an extent as to enable an Appropriation Bill to be dealt with before the end of the financial year. Clause 38 is the usual provision which allows transfers of money from one subdivision on the Estimates to another to make up any shortage that may occur. The next part of the Bill deals with audit and expenditure. The banks with which the public account is kept have at such times as may be directed by the Treasurer to send to him and also to the Auditor-General a copy of the Commonwealth Public Account Ledger - that is, a bank sheet containing the payments in and out day by day and the balance of the account. The Treasurer at the same time may, for the purpose of checking those to whom he has given advances, obtain a copy of the advance accounts. These are also for the information of the audit office. Then the Treasurer has to keep his cash-book. He enters up in that book day by day all the receipts and payments which have come to his knowledge. These he obtains by the statements which are forwarded to him by the officers who receive the money, and the officers who pay it out. Having entered up his cash sheet he- sends it on with various documents to . the Auditor-General, so that the Auditor-General is enabled day by day to keep up his audit of the year's accounts. Consequently, we find that, as well as the audit in the departments by the officers of the Auditor-General, there is an audit in the audit office which is going on continually with regard to all our receipts and payments. Provisions are set out in the Bill as to what is to be done in comparing and examining. If the Auditor-General is not satisfied, he has a .right to make inquiries from the Treasurer or any officer as to any point concerning- which he is not satisfied. If he is satisfied with regard to any expenditure he discharges the Treasurer with regard to that particular item of receipts or payments. If, on the other hand, he is not satisfied, he is to surcharge the Treasurer for any moneys short collected or for any money not duly accounted for or not properly credited,' or any expenditure which has not been properly vouched for and authorized. Sometimes small amounts are short by a few shillings of what ought to be collected. This occurs through a mere error, for which the officer is not held, blameworthy. These items accumulate from year to year, and appear annually in the </para>

                            <para>- The Trust Fund will be part of the public account. It will be kept in the Treasury, and if any attempt is made to draw on the Trust Fund for purposes other than those authorized the Treasurer will have staring him in the face the fact that he is directly and deliberately contravening an Act of Parliament. I think that will make him more cautious. Rather than draw upon the Trust funds, he probably will prefer to go to Parliament and ask for such authority as may be necessary to raise the money required ; or if he proposes that a portion of the Trust Fund should be lent to the Government for loan purposes - as may very well be done - -he will obtain the necessary Act of Parliament and the Trust Fund will obtain the security of the Commonwealth, just as any ordinary lender would obtain security for an amount advanced. These are the principal provisions of the Bill, with one exception, and that is with regard to moneys in London. While it is almost impossible to lay down hard and fast lines as to what should be done with expenditure and receipts in London, we have given power to the Governor-General in Council to make such arrangements as are from time to time necessary for that purpose. No doubt he will follow as closely as possible the lines of the Audit Act, but circumstances might arise which might prevent him from rigidly adhering to all the provisions of this Act. Therefore we have given him discretionary power to make such arrangements as may be considered necessary. The other parts of the Bill relate simply to the penalties which are to be imposed. One clause gives power to the Governor in Council to provide that in the outlying parts of a State, where it is impossible to get a magistrate to take a statutory declaration, a document signed by the officer who has to sign any sworn statement is to be considered a statutory declaration, and the mere signing of that document will render him liable to the same penalties as if he had signed a statutory declaration and thereby committed perjury. The last clause gives the usual power to make regulations regarding . the carrying out of the various clauses of the Bill, and provides the necessary forms. I have now placed before honorable members as briefly as possible the provisions of this Bill, which is I think practically a machinery Bill, and I shall be- glad if any honorable members can give me any suggestions which will enable me to make it a perfect measure for the purpose " for which it is designed. We all desire that the fullest control shall be exercised over the gentlemen who have to deal with the receipt and expenditure of our money, but at the same time we must take care that the public creditor is not unduly delayed in receiving payment of any claims he may have against the State. That is the object we have had in view in the preparation of this measure, and I submit it to the House with the confidence that honorable members will give me every assistance they possibly can to perfect it. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer should be warmly congratulated upon the very complete and -effectual measure that he has introduced. I have gone very carefully through the Bill and it seems to me not only to provide the usual safeguards, which are well known to the. Treasurers of sill the States, but to contain in addition a certain amount of original matter, part of which has been rendered necessary owing to the large extent of tie Commonwealth and the dealings with several States, whilst a part is, I think, a distinct improvement on all other Bills of asimilar character. No matter what the details of this Bill may be, certain things must be left to the administration, and I do hope that in laying down a system of public accounts we shall, as far as this Act and the safeguarding of the public interests will allow, make the provisions as simple as possible. _ I trust also that we shall not have, as we have had in New South Wales, one kind of statement exhibited to the public by the Treasurer and another account -by the Auditor-General, lt seems to me, from a business point .of view, that if books are based upon a proper system, the statement itself, in its very form, which the Auditor-General presents, should be an exact duplicate of the statement of the Treasurer, and that those points of difference which have so often occurred between the statements of the Treasurer and the Auditor-General should not occur in the future. There is just one matter in regard to the Auditor. General that is not provided for in the Bill ; he is not, I think - in fact, 1 am pretty sure - under the Civil Service Commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- There is no provision that he 'shall retire, unless otherwise arranged, at a certain age, and I think it would be well, especially in an office of this kind which requires the" closest possible attention and very great, in fact enormous care, that there should be a limit put to the service of the officer. I am glad to see that the right honorable gentleman has initiated in these Commonwealth accounts what is known as the cash system. I advocated that myself many years- ago, but as the Government to which I had the honour to belong had a majority of only four, and as a great deal of prejudice and ignorance attached to the old methods, it was impossible to bring the new system into effect. However, the right honorable gentleman at the head of the Opposition transformed the financial system of New South Wales by adopting the cash system. Previous to that we had the votes carried on from year to year until there was almost inextricable confusion. The cash system is absolutely perfect from a bookkeeping point of view ; but, if I am in order, I would like to draw attention to the two modes in which, no matter what system is adopted, the public outside may be misled by the statement of the public accounts. One of these modes has nothing to do with the machinery Bill, but the other has. No matter how we may keep the public accounts, if we place to loan account what should be paid out of revenue, the public must be misled. That is a thing that no system of public accounts, and no machinery can safeguard, and it must be left entirely to the vigilance of Parliament to prevent misconception. I do hope that when we begin to deal with loan moneys under this Commonwealth Government, we shall be very careful that every farthing of loan money is devoted to purposes proper to loans. </para>

                            <para>- The Auditor-General can never go beyond an Act of Parliament ; he is merely the creature of Parliament to see that this particular Act that we are passing is carried out in its integrity, and he cannot dictate or criticise Parliament in what it does on its own account. The other matter in which the public accounts may be misrepresented I find is provided for to some extent in the Bill. If we close our accounts under the cash system on the 30th . June, we might have Â£100,000 of money actually expended that , has not been taken into account. I want to be careful as to the phraseology in this matter. I do not mean commitments for the future, and I do not mean liabilities, but I mean work actually done for which an amount of indebtedness has accrued. Now, there is a provision to some extent dealing with that point, but I think we may with some advantage introduce a provision into this Bill by which, at any rate within three months after the end of the financial year, the Auditor-General should be required to hand to the Treasurer, to be placed before Parliament, an exact account of all the expenditure that has accrued, that had not been covered by the Government cheques during the previous year. </para>

That is to say, the Budget statement ought to be made as soon after the end of the financial year as possible. Honorable members do not want to wrangle, as too many Parliaments have wrangled, over pure matters of accounts ; there is no principle involved -in matters of accounts; members simply want to know the actual state of the public accounts at a given time. </para>

                            <para>-With regard to another matter which I believe the right honorable gentleman has referred to he has probably met a sort of popular prejudice. There is a popular prejudice against the Trea-surer using trust moneys, and I do not intend to cavil at the proposal by which an Act of Parliament, or instruction from Parliament, is necessary to enable a Treasurer to use these moneys.- After all, however, the. whole system of public accounts is based upon public credit. The country is liable for these trust funds, and can conceive many occasions upon which, from a financial point of view, it would be useless when Parliament is in recess to leave trust moneys idle when the Treasurer is in want of funds. However, the Bill errs on the safe side. I do not think honorable members would care for me to go over the matters referred to so fully by the Treasurer. I congratulate him on this piece of work, which must have entailed a great deal of labour. It seems to me that it is almost as perfect as such a machinery Bill could be made, and therefore I hope we shall not take up much time in discussing it on the second reading. No doubt it is very necessary that a Bill of this kind should be passed as soon as possible, in order that the Treasury machinery may be placed in order. </para>

                        <para>- I was under the impression that the debate would be resumed by the honorable member for Lang, but although I have been taken somewhat by surprise, I do not desire to see the second reading agreed to until I have availed myself of the opportunity to make a few remarks upon the general principles of the measure, especially after the invitation which has been held out to us to do so. I think that our work in committee may be facilitated, by a thorough discussion of the general principles of the Bill on the second reading stage. If we do not have this discussion we shall not have a general and comprehensive view of the whole measure when we come to tackle individual clauses. The draftsmen who prepared the Bill, and the Minister in charge of it, have had at their disposal a wealth of material in the Public Service Acts which have been in operation in the various States for many year's past. I have a distinct recollection of the time when the cry arose in Victoria against what is known as political patronage, and in favour of removing the administration of the public service from the responsible Ministers to departmental boards. I believe that there were many abuses which led to that agitation, but that so far as the Members of Parliament of that time were concerned - I think that the agitation of which I am speaking took place in 1883 or 1884 - they did not desire to retain for any purposes of their own what is known as political patronage; and I believe that they, as well as all Members of Parliament of the present day, would agree that political patronage, even if it can be exercised, is an utter nuisance with which we did not want to have anything to do. But in considering this question of "the proper administration of the public' service with a view to legislation' in regard to it, it is advisable to ascertain what political patronage means ; and as three glaring instances of it I may mention - first, the helping to get a man a billet; secondly, the helping him to get promotion; and thirdly, the helping him to get an increase of salary. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that that would be an instance of political patronage ; it would be rather a matter of administration. ' I believe that I am voicing the opinions of the members of the Parliament of Victoria fifteen years ago, of the members of this Parliament and of the members of the Parliaments of the States when I say that we do not want to have anything to do with political patronage of that kind. But, whilst not desiring to exercise patronage or influence of any kind for political considerations, we should inflexibly resolve that we will see that the public service is properly manned and equipped, and that its business is conducted with efficiency and satisfaction to the whole community. The question is how far can this result be obtained by transferring not only political patronage but power and control from responsible Ministers to irresponsible boards. I am not at' all sure that many of the Acts from which this Bill has been compiled have been successful in their operation, though the framers of them may have intended well, and I have not the slightest doubt did so intend. If we glance back along the track of the legislative efforts of the Victorian Parliament during the last fifteen years we shall see that the statute-book is strewn with Amending Acts. Year after year measures have been brought in to remedy mistakes in the original organic Act, or to rectify anomalies which have grown up under it; and I should like to know whether the responsible Ministers of Victoria are even now satisfied with the results of that legislation. So far as patronage and administrative work are concerned in the public service of Victoria, I find, after having examined some off the Acts which have been passed, that a lot of the work which it was intended should be done by the Public Service Commissioners had actually to be done by special classifying boards brought into existence by special legislation. For instance, the Reclassification Board of last year, which had for its chairman Judge Chomley, a very able man, was created under a special Act of Parliament. That fact shows that after fifteen years of experience the provisions of the original Act were found to have broken down. The classification and the grading, which were supposed to have been done by the Public Service Commissioners, a highly paid board,, was not done, and it was necessary for Parliament to intervene and pass a special Act to rectify .the anomalies which had arisen. </para>

                            <para>- However, it is not necessary to discuss that matter now. I am drawing attention to the subject merely to urge a word of caution, by suggesting that we should not join in any indiscrimin"ating cry for the removal of political power from responsible Ministers to an irresponsible board. I would ask the House, in dealing with this Bill, to discriminate between patronage coming within the definition of the instances,! have mentioned and political power. There is undoubtedly an essential difference between patronage and political power. I say without fear of contradiction that this Parliament should not part with any political power that it may be deemed advisable and necessary to retain in order to secure efficiency in the administration of the public service. I cannot see why a Public Service Commissioner can more effectually wield political power than can a responsible Minister. But before proceeding to discuss and to draw attention to the elementary principles of the Bill, I think it would be wise to keep steadily in view what should be regarded as the indispensable principles of a public service scheme. Honorable members will find this matter well discussed in a most valuable and interesting book in the Library, which I have recently had the pleasure of reading. It is a work entitled " Efficiency and Empire," and is written by Mi-. Arnold </para>

                            <para>- So far as the clerical division is concerned there are all these safeguards, and provision is made for regulations as to the mode of entry into the professional division and general division, which, I apprehend, will follow on the same lines. If those provisions are made we can rest assured that entrance into the public service of the Commonwealth will be well guarded and well provided for. The next question is - what is to be the tenure of the public servant once he passes his examination and has gone through his period of probation ? What is his legal position % We find by clause 57 that the public servant has no freehold tenure of his office, and with that principle I thoroughly agree. We ought not to appoint public servants in this country on anything like a freehold tenure, as they are in some divisions of the public service in the old country. When public servants of the future enter the service of the Commonwealth - and this clause, I apprehend, will apply only to new appointments - they will enter with this clause staring them in the face. They will know that if in course of time any great emergency, or any great change of a widespread character arises, demanding extensive alterations in the service, the Government of the country is the supreme master, and can make such changes as may be necessary in the interests of the Government and the Commonwealth without being sued in an action for wrongful dismissal. But although this clause is in the Bill as a safeguard of the rights of the Commonwealth - of the supreme power of the Commonwealth - no one need apprehend that any injustice will be done under that provision. Although the public servant does enter the service with that knowledge, and with this possibility of being dismissed at any time on public grounds, he need be under no apprehension that that will ever be done - so long as he does his duty well, and so long as there is work for him to do, his services will be retained. If clause 57 be exercised in a tyrannical manner, it will be exercised by responsible Ministers - Ministers responsible to this House ; and if Ministers exercise it unjustly, they stand the liability of being ejected from office in the same way as they have ejected the public servant. So far as the clerical division is concerned, it .will be interesting to notice how the young public servant gets through his various subdivisions of the class. During the previous night's debate, some doubt seemed to exist in the minds of honorable members as to the mode of progress from the lowest subdivision to the highest subdivision of a class. Some members seemed to be under the impression that the progress is automatic - that is, from year to year, without the intervention of any Ministerial mandate - while others were doubtful. As the result of a careful examination of the clauses relating to this matter, I have arrived at the conclusion that there is no provision for the automatic progress of a public servant from one division to another without the intervention of some authority. Provision is made for his being promoted from one subdivision to another after a service of twelve months. But, strange to say, the Bill does not say who is to promote him - whether he is promoted from one subdivision of a class to another by the Minister or by the commissioner. That remains in doubt ; I cannot find a clause stating exactly who is to do it. No doubt in the absence of a provision to the contrary the Minister will promote and take the responsibility ; but I think something ought to be put into the Bill to show by whom a public servant is to be promoted. </para>

I do not know whether the same thing is intended in the clause, but dealing with the words which appear in the Bill I say there is no provision saying in extact words when a public servant is to be promoted from one subdivision to another. It may be contended that under clause 36 he is to be promoted from one office to another, but that clause only deals with offices. My first point is that there is no provision of the kind I have indicated, and the Bill ought to be made clear, and this matter not left to some general clause as to how an officer is to be promoted from one subdivision to another. </para>

                            <para>- Clause 9 deals, I think, with classification by the commissioner, and not with promotion from subdivision to subdivision. I agree with honorable members that so far as the fifth class is concerned provision ought to be made for the progressive advance of a young officer from his class to the top, in so far as he shows he is entitled to promotion, and does his work and has no black mark against him. The salaries within the fifth class are very moderate, and I do not see that any serious harm will be done by allowing the advancement of a public servant from subdivision to subdivision, unless he has done something to disentitle him to promotion. </para>

                            <para>- Or, of course, unless he has .failed to do something causing him to be placed on the black list. Another point is that I do not see any provision for promotion from class to class. Such a provision may be found in some remote or ambiguous clause, but I do not see it stated iri so many words that a man may be promoted, from class to class, or under what conditions he may be so promoted. It is true that it is said a man shall not be promoted from one class to another until there is a vacancy in the higher class, but still it seems in doubt who is to promote from class to class - whether the promotion is vested solely in the commissioner, or vested solely in the Minister. With regard to subdivisions, I notice that there is a clear provision made by clause 21, sub-clause (8), under which subdivisions may be skipped. That is, a man may be promoted from the fifth subdivision to the fourth or from the fifth to the top of the class so far as I can see, but I suppose that clause will be brought into operation only under very special circumstances. I agree that some provision of the kind ought to be made so long as it is surrounded by proper conditions and safeguards. The Ministry or the Government of the day ought to be in a position to pick out within the fifth class or fourth class, as the case may be, any specially promising civil servant of talent and promote him over the heads of others. No doubt that is a very great power, which is considered by some to be dangerous. But all power may be abused, and, in. this case, I think the power is a useful one, being accompanied, so far as I remember the clause, with three conditions - first the recommendation of a permanent head, secondly the approval of the Minister, and thirdly the sanction of the commissioner. Anything that is done with so many safeguards can hardly be regarded as of a dangerous character. I would like to know whether, under the Bill, there can be any similar skipping of a class - I ask the Attorney-General to take a note of this - and, if so, under what authority and with what safeguard. It is quite clear that public servants may be transferred from division to division under clause 35. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite clear that there is a provision for skipping from subdivision to subdivision, but I want to know whether an officer may skip from class to class - in other words, may he skip from the fifth to the third class. If an officer can do that, let us understand so and discuss the matter on its merits. But before we discuss it, let us understand if that can be done, and let us know who is to be responsible for the exercise of the power. I can understand that if it is to be exercised with the same safeguards as the skipping from subdivision to subdivision, there can be hardly any serious objection raised. If the Minister, the permanent head, and the commissioner, all three, join in recommending that a man shall be jumped from the fifth class to the third class, or to the first class, then no doubt such a thing would not be done except in the interests of the public service, which must prevail over .the interests of individuals who may, no doubt, feel aggrieved. Clause 27 contains a very important power. It is a dispensing power - power to dispense with examination and the ordinary probation system in special cases. If the permanent head is prepared to recommend, and the commissioner is prepared to nominate some person outside the service to fill a vacancy for which there is no one qualified in the service, then the Minister may make the appointment. That is an example on the same lines as skipping from subdivision to subdivision-, and I certainly concur in the proposition that the Ministry of the day, if they find that there is no one in the public service who is thought to be good enough for the position, ought to be allowed to go outside and select from the whole world. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that I would go as far as that. It is a matter for consideration whether the commissioner should be bound to certify that there is no one in the service suitable for the position. I am not going to cripple the hands of the Executive Government in a matter of this kind. If the whole of these statutory authorities, commissioner, permanent head, and Minister agree, this House may rest assured that no wrong has been done, and that what has been decided upon is in the interest of the service. Under clauses 17 to 20provision is made for salaries and wages. Those who cry out loudly against political patronage had better look to these clauses, because under the provision relating to the determination of salaries and wages, a very great amount of power is reserved to the Governor in Council. I will come to that point again presently, but I am now taking a rapid general survey of the Bill. With regard to classification and grading, provision is made by clause 9, by which the commissioner is endowed with power to determine the division, class, subdivision, and grading of every officer in the service. Clause 9 embodies the most important power entrusted to the commissioner. In fact, I venture to say that the clause is the only clause in the whole of Bill which gives the commissioner anything like unfettered power on the face of it. But contrast clause 9 with clause 35, sub-clause (c ) and what do we find ? Under the latter clause the Governor-General may - </para>

Honorable members should observe that the permanent head is to have a voice in that matter, whilst the commissioner is not to be allowed to nominate an outsider for special work under special conditions. The permanent head is to have a voice, but I want to know why he should have anything to say if we are to have a commissioner ? We are to trust the commissioner, giving him statutory authority and a large salary, and yet he may be blocked by the permanent head, who may perhaps have some ideas of his own to which he wishes to give effect. The clause which deals with the nominating power of the commissioner is clause 38. That brings me to the question which I referred to at an earlier stage as to what is the meaning of this clause. Clause 36 says - </para>

                        <para>Whenever a vacancy occurs in any office and it is expedient to fill such vacancy by the promotion of an officer the Governor-General may subject to the provisions of this Act - appoint to fill such vacancy an officer of the department in which such vacancy occurs or, subject to ' various contingencies, an officer from any other department. That is the gist of the clause. What I wish to know is whether the expression " when a vacancy occurs in any office" means "when a vacancy occurs in a subdivision " or " when a vacancy occurs in a class "? </para>

Because, if it is, then before a vacancy can be filled the officer must have passed the examination prescribed by clause 37, and, in addition, the Governor-General in Council will not be able to act unless the recommendation of the permanent head and the nomination of the commissioner have been first secured. If that be so, I do not see any objection to the provision, but I only want to know for certain whether it is so or not. </para>

                            <para>- I do not understand why the power should be vested in th Governor-General to decide what officers should be included in the various divisions. That is a power which might fairly rest with the commissioner, subject to the veto of the Governor-General in Council. Another very important power is given under this Bill which may be objected to by those who have described it as political patronage. Power is given to the Governor-General under clause 20 to prescribe the rate of pay to be given to any officer. That is an enormous power, and it seems to me an undesirable thing that it should be vested in th Governor-General instead of in the commissioner. I think the Governor-General in Council might be relieved of a great deal of trouble by handing all these powers over to the commissioner, the right of review being reserved to the Governor-General in Council. </para>

                            <para>- The provision amounts to this, that, although there is a schedule defining the salaries of those who are engaged in the clerical division, under this clause 20 the Governor-General may select any particular individual within a certain class and fix his salary, subject only to the restriction that it must be within the limits assigned to the class. That is- a very great power, and I do not see at the present time the necessity for it. In a classified service with rates of pay specified in a schedule, there should be no necessity to give the Governor-General power to regulate salaries. There may be reasons for this provision which I have not yet heard. Under clause 35, to which I have already drawn the attention of honorable members, there is a very great power which is apparently unqualified, because it provides ^ that the Governor-General may from time to time do certain things without any reservation whatever. This clause does not say, as is provided in clause 36, that the Governor-General may do certain things " subject to the provisions of this Act." .Under clause 35 the Governor may create a new office at the request of the permanent head of the department. Of course there is a provision there that he" can act only under certain conditions, but it is also provided that he may abolish any office without being subject to any condition whatever. There is no check on his action in that matter, and I would like to know whether it is intended that there should be. </para>

                            <para>- If that is so, I have nothing further to say. lt is not necessary to go through all these clauses, but I would again point out that there are powers vested in the Governor in Council which the Executive ought not to be . anxious to assume or exercise. I would like to know why they should want to transfer or retire officers, or create new offices, or transfer officers from the clerical to the professional division, and so on. I have merely drawn' .attention to a number of clauses in this Bill for the purpose of debate, and I have not been actuated by any captious spirit. ' I think it is desirable that we should all understand the Bill, and should help one another ; and as one honorable member has made a very strenuous appeal in certain quarters to secure what he has described as the destruction of political influence, I would draw his attention to the fact that this Bill is a veritable reservoir of political power, and that it confers a great deal of political influence and a small amount of political patronage. Political power may be necessary - such political power as is required to maintain the efficiency of the service, and that we ought to retain. Any political influence that may be necessary to secure the efficiency of the sen-ice we should also retain, but as regards political patronage, I think that the less we have of it the better. If it is necessary in connexion with a certain grade of office, the Governor in council ought to exercise it, and under this Bill he will exercise it, subject to reasonable safeguards in the shape of the criticism of Parliament, and also the active criticism of the public. On the whole, I think this Bill is a very good one. It is capable of improvement in the direction I have mentioned, by the transfer of a certain amount of work that is more in the nature of drudgery than patronage from the Executive Government to the commissioner. To that extent I think tha Bill may be largely improved. We want the Executive to have time to deal with great issues and great principles, to attend to the preparation of Bills, and to review legislation and administration of a broad federal character. We do not want Ministers of the Crown to have their time wasted in dealing with a large number of petty details which may very well be transferred to the trustworthy officers who are provided for under the Bill ; but, at the same time, I would warn them not to part with any powers that may be necessary to secure the efficiency that we are determined to maintain in the service of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- If there is an improper transfer by the Government we can stop it. As a matter of fact, we have had too much discussion in the State Parliaments as to whether the particular action of Governments in regard to individuals has been proper or not. However, the interjection of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne raises the issue very fairly. Is Parliament going to watch every single transfer, promotion, or change in t]] status of every officer in the service? If Parliament is going to undertake that task, let us understand clearly that we have this work before us, and that we are going to have in the future, as we have had in the past, a great deal of time, which should be devoted to matters of Australian moment, devoted to questions concerning individual members of the service. If we are going to have a commissioner whom we cannot trust we had better not have a commissioner at all. If the system proposed in the Bill remains, and the Government are taxed with having made an improper transfer, they will at once say that it was the commissioner's direction or nomination - that it was recommended by the permanent head "with the approval of the commissioner, and so on. Then we shall be brought face to face with the position that we are passing what is practically a vote of want of confidence in the commissioner. I quite admit there are objections to the course 1 advocate. I do not know any course which could be advocated to which there are not objections, and very strong objections, too. </para>

                            <para>- We have talk sometimes without finality when Estimates are not before us. A third point to which I wish to allude is as to the carrying out of the duties assigned to the various officers by the commissioner. In that respect, it is obvious the permanent head must be responsible to somebody - I will say to whom in a moment - for the proper carrying out of the work. In my view, either the Governor-General or the commissioner should supply the permanent head with sufficient public servants to enable him to carry out the work, and the permanent head must see the work is carried out. I am heartily in accord with those who say that the less the permanent head has to do with promotions or transfers the better, because, clearly, his work is more to see that the work of the department is done than to consider who is to do it. So long as a permanent head has officers who can do the work, he should be satisfied, and if he has not the officers, then he should apply to the persons who have to supply them, namely, the commissioner or the Governor-General, as the case may be. The responsibility of the permanent head is not to see who are to be promoted, or who are not to be promoted, though, of course, his opinion should also be taken and listened to, because he has more opportunities than has the commissioner or, at all events, more opportunities than has the Governor-General, of knowing what the work is like. But his position in this respect should be purely advisory. </para>

                            <para>- The permanent head should not be allowed to block promotions. His responsibility is to see that the work is properly done, and the question is as to whom he should be responsible. Up to the present I have simply referred to the Governor-General and the commissioner, and to my mind every communication between the Governor-General and the public service should go through the commissioner. There are some provisions in the Bill under which the permanent head reports direct to the Governor-General, while there are other cases in which the Minister reports direct to the Governor-General. There are other cases still in which the chief officer, I think, reports direct to the Governor-General, and cases in which the commissioner reports direct to the Governor-General. But all communications between the Executive and the service should go from the Executive to the commissioner, in order that there should be a train of responsibility running from the top to the bottom. If my suggestion were adopted and all these formal duties cast by the Bill on the Governor-General went over to the commissioner, we should be able to conduct the service without continual references from all sorts of officers to the Governor-General. The permanent head should be responsible for the work of his department, not to the commissioner nor to the Governor-General, but to the Minister responsible to Parliament. In that way it seems to me the permanent head and the Minister would run together as one couple, in exactly the same way as the commissioner and the Governor-General in Council would run together as another couple. The permanent head should be restrained from interfering with the powers of promotion and matters of that kind, and should be practically directed to devote his attention to carrying out the work of his department. He should be responsible to the Minister, and in that way Parliament would be in touch with the service in two directions. Parliament would be in touch with the service as regards its constitution and its personnel through the Governor-General - that is, the responsible Minister - and it would be in touch with the departments through the Minister in regard to the work the department is absolutely doing. Parliament would be kept in touch with what was being done, and at the same time there would be kept apart things it is well to keep apart, and confusion would be prevented in regard to the various powers given to various officers. I would like to refer to a few instances in which it seems to me this Bill errs - sins not only against what I have suggested, but also against any scheme whatever. Under clause 20 which has already been referred to, the Governor-General has power to fix the salary of an officer within a class - not of an office but of an officer, although he may not reduce the salary. In the Bill, in most places, we find that the Governor-General's power is to deal with offices and hot with officers. That I have already said is a proper distribution - the Governor-General should deal with offices and the commissioner with officers. If we take another clause we find that the Governor-General has power to transfer officers between the professional and the clerical divisions - either from the professional to the clerical, or from the clerical to the professional. That, in my view, is a matter that should properly be attended to by the commissioner, because the Governor-General would do only as the commissioner recommended. </para>

                            <para>- The commissioner should be ultimately responsible, just as the commissioner should be responsible for other appointments. The Governor-General should determine the regulations under which temporary employes are selected, but once the system has been determined we should leave to some other than political persons the selection of the individuals. It is in accord with the principle already mentioned that one person determines the office and the other determines the persons ; one determines the method by which persons are to be chosen - that is the Governor-General in Council - and the other authority, the commissioner, has to determine who is to be chosen under that method.. No doubt in the case of temporary employment, there will be a register of men to be selected in their turns, but we do not want the Minister to be responsible for that register. I now want to say a word as to the inspectors. They are mentioned in clauses 5, 6, 8, and 10. Then they are not mentioned again until we come to clause 55. I imagine that the object of appointing these inspectors or sub-commissioners as' it is suggested they should be called, is that they may exercise certain inspecting powers throughout the various portions of the Commonwealth. Their jurisdiction should be territorial and not departmental. That is to say, they should inspect departments within a certain given area, and not one department throughout the Commonwealth. I confess I do not like the terms of clause 5, which says that the inspectors may perform such duties as the commissioner may direct. It seems to me that that would be leaving things somewhat too loose and ill-defined. There is another clause which prescribes certain duties that the inspectors have to perform, and the Government might very well define more fully what the duties are. If that be not done, let the Governor-General in Council, who is the proper person to settle these matters, determine what the duties of the inspectors are to be. </para>

                            <para>- When the honorable and learned member for Parkes was speaking last week, he objected to the name "inspector," and I ventured to interject that a change of name would not get rid of the fact. A certain set of gentlemen will be appointed inspectors. They are. to go through the departments, and see whether the permanent heads and their subordinates are doing the duties assigned to them. Whatever name you give to them, their work will be supervisory, and it does not seem to me that there is anything to be gained by altering the name when the fact remains unchanged. If it be Said that the commissioner cannot control the service in the way suggested, that the permanent heads cannot do their work, and that for these reasons we must have supervision by inspectors, then I think it is a matter of doubtful wisdom to appoint inspectors for such purposes. There cannot but be strained relations between officers high in the service and the inspectors if there should be a difference between them as to any particular kind of work. If it be said that the duties of the inspectors are - I do not like to use the word spy - to investigate into the service and the way it is conducted, and report to the commissioner what they think desirable, because the commissioner cannot do all the work himself, then I think it is worthy of consideration whether such officers find a proper place in this scheme. But in any case I do not see any objection to the use of the word "inspector." I do not desire to detain the House at greater length. No doubt, like other honorable members, I shall in Committee find that there are matters which require to be referred to in detail. I really rose for the purpose of pointing out that to my mind there is a system which should be followed, and that that system has been departed from on a considerable number of instances in this Bill. It appears to me that we should recognise the gradations of responsibility and the divisions of responsibility, and that we should not mix up two sets of responsibility. We should not disregard the seniority of the commissioner, nor go past him to the Governor-General on matters which are within his province. That practice would not be for the good of the discipline of any service in which it obtained, and I do not think it would be for the good of the discipline of the public service. Of course, if it would be too cumbrous to let things go to the commissioner that are practically formal, and should be dealt with otherwise, that would be a very good reason for departing from the principle ; but wherever it is departed from there should be something to justify the departure. I am not quarrelling with the Bill generally. If honorable members make an effort to do what they desire, I believe it will come out of committee a good deal better measure than it now is. The combined wisdom of the House will do a great deal to improve the measure, and this Bill, like many other things, not excluding a Bill introduced by the first Commonwealth Government, is certainly capable of improvement. </para>

                            <para>- Because public servants must appeal to some one, and I think that the members who represent them in the Parliament of the country are the proper persons to listen to their grievances. We are, of course, in a position to review the conduct of the responsible officers from time to time, but there would not be the same necessity for the adverse criticism which very frequently takes place, if we could insure that the commissioner and the inspectors would make close inquiries, in the course of which those officials whose conduct is in question could be represented in such a way that they could have their grievance fairly put forward. There is one thing I would like to see, and that is, a clear definition as to who is really to be the officer responsible for the administration of the Act. Like the previous speaker, I have read this Bill, and, whilst in the first place I thought that this Public Service Bill, like the similar Acts now in existence in the various States, was to be free from political influence, it seems to me that this measure is teeming with political influence. Opportunities appear to present themselves for persons who may be in sympathy with the Government to secure appointments, and it may be that others who are in close touch with the permanent Under-Secretaries, or who may be appreciated . or admired by the commissioner, will receive appointments, but it seems to me that all those who have to do with the administration of the Act should put their heads together in order to decide who is the best man to fill any given position. Then there is another clause which seems to offer opportunities for making appointments outside the service, and that is a thing that I must say I feel strong objection to. In our State, when an appointment is to be made from outside the service, the general feeling is, if it is a good appointment, that it is going to be given to some friend of the Government, in consideration of political services or something of that kind, and that such appointments are not always left open for those who have worked their way in the service from the bottom rung of the ladder. Those men who have done good work in the service, should have first consideration when good appointments are to be made. I have not risen with the intention to delay this measure, but, on the contrary, I am very glad to see that the Government have taken it in hand so early. I would, however, like to see the Government make some very much clearer definition as to who is to be the permanent head, and, more than that, I would like to see them do away with the powers conferred upon the Governor-General, which will really resolve themselves into the expression of Ministerial approval. It is clear to me that if appointments are made by the commissioner, or are recommended by the permanent heads, and such appointments do not happen to be in accordance with the wishes of the Ministers, they will not be made. I should like to see the commissioner made the responsible officer, who should refer to the permanent heads, more for information than anything else, and the confirmation of appointments by the Executive Council should be largely a matter of form. Furthermore, greater facilities should be given to our public men, and those who feel themselves aggrieved by the action of the authorities in the service to have their grievances ventilated. Those who have such grievances should be represented at the inquiries that are instituted into their cases, so that the decisions arrived at may be come to in the full light of day. When these matters come before Parliament for discussion in connexion with the Estimates, instead of their being hushed up, and difficulty being experienced in getting information, except in. the form of reports or returns, all the papers relating to the inquiries I have referred to should be fully accessible, and we should be able to judge whether the men in high and responsible office are wisely and properly carrying out the duties with which they have been intrusted. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my intention to take up the time of the House for more than a very few minutes. I should like to congratulate the Government upon having brought forward this measure. The Commonwealth having taken over many of the officers of the States, will have to do something to provide for those public servants who have hitherto been dealt with under the State laws. I can see that in connexion with this Bill there is a great difficulty arising from the distances between the various States. I will instance our own State - Western Australia - which is some 2,000 miles away. It appears to me that under a Bill of this description unless there is some one on the spot in each State who will be able to act as sub-commissioner, great hardships will result. What we all want is fair play to the Government and fair play to those who are in our employ, and we want the provisions of the Bill so framed that there will be no possibility whatever of any of our employes being unfairly dealt with. With us in Western Australia, a great deal of dissatisfaction has arisen in many of the departments, notably in our railway department. In that department there are officers who have been working for six or seven years, and who have found men taken from outside and placed in positions which should have been made available to those already in the service. That is a state of things which certainly should be avoided, and this Bill should be considered with a view to safeguard us in that regard as much as possible. I take it that this Bill is. somewhat of an experimental one as far as the Commonwealth is concerned owing to the difficulty which I have referred to. There should, in my opinion, be a commissioner or sub-commissioner in almost each State to deal with cases as they arise. We can scarcely define what the duties of the inspectors should be. The controlling officer in each State should be something more than an inspector, as he should have power to suspend an officer, subject to any appeal which might be made by the individual concerned to the higher authority of the commissioner, and thence to the Governor-General. I think that if we provide for something of this kind it will give satisfaction to all parties. There is one clause in the Bill - clause 28 - which provides that no person shall be appointed to the clerical division' who is under the age of sixteen years, and I think that is a very proper provision. But I do not see any age specified supposing a lad requires to be taken into some other division which is not clerical. No doubt that is a matter which will occupy the attention of the framer of the Bill. It is not my intention to discuss the Bill in detail, because I really had no idea that the measure would have been carried so far to-night. I was under the impression that another Bill would have occupied all the evening, and, had that been so, I should have had more time to have looked into the matter. As it is, I must apologize for not being able to deal with it as I should have liked. At the same time the Government have done well to bring in a Bill of this description, which, I think, will meet with the approval of the whole of the community of the Commonwealth. I shall in all cases assist the Government in passing the Bills they may bring forward for the good of the Commonwealth ; they may always rest assured of any little help I may be able to give, however humble that help may be. </para>

Surely there should be some provision in the measure which will require public servants to pay their debts, so that the service may be kept pure. Democracy must assert itself, and if democracy wants to be recognised as just it must pay its debts. I do not want to do anything that will interfere with the progress of the measure, which I regard as a very fair one taking it all round, therefore I shall content myself with the statement that I have very great pleasure in supporting the action of the Ministry in regard to it. </para>

It seems to me that we are inclined 'to forget that the public service exists for the Commonwealth, and not the Commonwealth for the public service. In considering an important measure Of this description, the question of securing the highest and best service for the public should be continually kept in view. It seems .to me that under the government by commission system which has been adopted in Victoria, a great deal of dissatisfaction has been created among the public servants, and that there is very -good ground for that dissatisfaction. While I believe that the Public Service Board is composed Of men who desire to do their duty fearlessly and faithfully, it is not able to comprehend the whole of the ramifications of the public service. I believe that, so far as the board comes into contact with the heads of departments and leading officials, it does its duty ; but it knows absolutely nothing of the nien in the lower grades of the service. It is a notorious fact that our public service, even now that the work of the Reclassification Board, to which the honorable and learned member for Bendigo referred, has been carried out, is seething with discontent and disloyalty. </para>

                            <para>- The public servants are disloyal in the sense that they are dissatisfied; and men- who are dissatisfied will not give anything like such good service as that which you -get from satisfied men. There is good reason for this dissatisfaction. Two years ago it came under my notice that a young man who entered the Customs department as an apprentice to learn to make life-buoys was engaged at the wage of 2s. a day, and that after serving six years, during which time he frequently applied to the board for an increase, but without success, it was only on the urgent demand of the Minister of the day that he could obtain justice. There we have a case of a man 24 years of age, who had been six years in the service, who was receiving, as a journeyman, only the same wages as were given to him when he entered the department as an- apprentice. </para>

                            <para>- I know of another case where an officer who is administering the Victorian Closer Settlement department is receiving only Â£200 a year. Two Ministers in succession represented to the Public Service Board that this officer is in his wrong Glass, and is not receiving adequate payment, but for some reason or other the head of the department appears to block any change, so that' the man is still doing his responsible and important work for the salary I have mentioned. I might cite other cases to show that the Victorian system is not at the present time at all satisfactory. I recognise, as any one who has had to do with large bodies of working men, and to supervise persons employed on responsible work must recognise, that the difficulties connected with the administration of the public service are very great. I recognise that to promote men simply on account of length of service would mean that persons would be promoted who would not be the best men for the positions they were called upon to occupy ; but I also recognise that to vest in one man, such as the proposed commissioner, full power to deal with the public service without review and without responsibility to any one would create a condition of things that would be largely intolerable. The commissioner will have under him 12,000 or 13,000 employes, and how can he know, as he should know, the abilities, requirements, and aspirations of every one of those men ? It seems to me that the proposal to appoint inspectors is a redeeming feature of the Bill ; but to my mind one inspector for each State will not be enough,because in- order to do justice to the public servants, these inspectors, or sub-commissioners as they have been called, should be fully acquainted with the details of the duties which each public servant is called upon to perform, and should know how those duties are being performed. The acquirement of- such knowledge is quite impossible under the Victorian system, and it seems to me that it will be impossible for one inspector, even at the inception of our Commonwealth service, to adequately inform himself of the conditions of employment of every public servant in a State. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to refer very briefly to one or two of the main principles of the Bill. Before doing so, I desire to congratulate the Minister who introduced it. The measure is one which, on being looked over, bears evidence of a great deal of industry, and seems one to form the nucleus of a very fair working measure. The Bill is not, in my opinion, anything like perfect, and, indeed, having regard to the difficult and complex nature of the problems which it seeks to solve, it is very doubtful if it will be anything like perfect when it emerges from a committee of the House. At the same time, it must be admitted that the Minister has made an honest and earnest effort to put before us a Bill which, after it has run the gauntlet of criticism and has perhaps received some amendment, should form a very fair working measure. The question is one of far-reaching importance. It forms one of the foundation stones on which the structure of the Commonwealth is to be reared. It forms the basis of the contract between the people of the Commonwealth as employers on one side and over 1 1 , 000 employes on the other. The duty of Parliament, in my opinion, is not to lean unduly either to the one side or the other. We should endeavour to hold the scales of justice as evenly as we possibly can between employers on the one hand and employes on the other. We must remember that, so far as the employers are concerned, the measure we place on the statute-book will be largely responsible for the efficiency or non-efficiency of the discharge of the functions of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, it is not only the employes but their families who will be affected whom we have to consider. It is our duty in the first place to endeavour to secure fair value to the people - to the taxpayers of the Commonwealth - for the money that will be devoted towards the maintenance and payment of the public service. On the other hand, it is our duty to see that the employes are fairly remunerated for any duties they perform, and that they are well treated in every way possible. It is only by having a loyal and contented public service that we may expect to have the. duties properly performed. I thoroughly agree with the decision of the Ministry to have one commissioner instead of two or three. Where you have divided duties you have divided responsibilities in case of any mistakes being made. It is very much better that we should have one commissioner - and only one - to look to for the efficient discharge of the duties which are vested in him. Those duties of the commissioner should be clearly defined! They should not be defined in a fragmentary manner as they are in the Bill. If this Bill were handed to a commissioner as his instructions - and if he were to find the whole of his instructions in the Act of Parliament under which he is appointed - he would have great difficulty in ascertaining what his duties were and what was the extent of his power. I should like to see those duties defined, either in one clause with a number of sub-clauses, or in a succession of clauses, laying down clearly the basis of the duties. Further, I should like to see the commissioner's powers considerably strengthened. I should like to see less of the Governor in Council, who, of course, means the Minister, and, in turn, means the interference of Members of Parliament. Wherever there is the Governor in Council, there we find political influence, and we should endeavor, as far as possible, to eliminate that influence. There should be a proper division of labour. It is the duty of the Government to define the functions that have to be performed, and to lay them down in an Act of Parliament ; and in my humble judgment it is the duty of the commissioner, and. the commissioner alone, to see that the proper persons are selected for the discharge of those duties. </para>

Indeed, I am not at all sure that it would be a bad thing even to give the commissioner the appointment of the permanent heads. Then, again, I agree with the provision, so far as it goes, to make the permanent head responsible for the working of his department. I do not think the permanent head should have anything to do with appointments or promotions. If he is not satisfied with the work he is getting from an officer in the department under his control, it is his duty to complain to the commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, only in a much more drastic manner, perhaps. What struck me then - and it is a very difficult thing to avoid - is the great tendency in every department of the State to overman. If a department be overmanned it means underpaying the servants, whereas if only a proper number of hands be engaged the ' State can afford to pay the servants a fair remuneration for the duties to be performed. The permanent heads of the various departments are interested in magnifying the work of their departments. Their status is judged to a very large extent by the number of hands employed, the number of sub-branches or sub-departments as they may be called, and the amount of money each department disburses. So that really the personal interests of the heads of the departments run counter to the interests of the people. I do not say that there has been much abuse in Victoria in this respect, because we have been very fortunate in the selection of our permanent heads. But I can see the tendency in every department is to grow. In the first place, a position is created for an individual, a position that is perhaps intended to be temporary. That individual in time gets one or two assistants, and the office grows into a branch, and finally into a sub-department. I will not name the department, but in looking through one department I saw the duties of one officer, and he a high-salaried officer, defined as being in charge of the branch ; and when I came to examine I found that the branch consisted of that officer and one boy. As this is some years ago, it is probable that branch has grown into a very decent sub-department by this time. That is a tendency which has to be checked so far as it can be, and I should like the Minister in charge of this measure to take note, more especially of those two main points - first, that the duties of the commissioner ought to be clearly defined, and in the next place that the position of the commissioner ought to be materially strengthened, so as to give him more power, and, as a natural corollary, more responsibility, and to separate his work entirely from the work of the Governor in Council. I find there is a desire - I believe with the very best intentions -on the part of the Minister to create a balance of power, but I am afraid a balance of power is a dangerous thing. It is hard to say where the final responsibility is to be fixed ; but if you vest the power in one particular individual, no mistake can be made as to where is the final responsibility. There is another point in regard to the selection of public servants. I forget who it was - I believe it was an honorable member from New South Wales who referred to the subject, and I was a good deal impressed with his remark about the desirability of selecting healthy men. </para>

                            <para>- It is an extraordinary thing that in any department in the State there can' be found a large number of extra hands who have to be employed on account of those absent on sick leave. Any Minister having charge of a large department is signing permission for absence on sick leave almost every hour of the day. It appears to me that a careful selection of officers in the first instance would mitigate that to some extent. </para>

                            <para>- In Victoria- and I see it is so proposed in the Bill - the number of applicants for a position is reduced by lot. I am not at all sure that that is a wise provision. In the Police department they manage things very differently, and very much more successfully. In that department there is a competent board of experts who interview every applicant, and select men who appear to be the best fitted for the duties they are to perform. </para>

                            <para>- After applicants have been seen by the board of experts they are sent on to the medical expert, at whose hands they undergo a very careful examination, and are disqualified if they do not pass. I believe we should have a better and more efficient public service if a similar course of selection were adopted. That would be much better than reducing the number by lot - a system under which there is a chance that a very large number of most competent applicants might be excluded. I do not wish to detain the House, but in my opinion the more this Bill is discussed, and the more carefully it is discussed, the better. That would be time well spent. </para>

                        <para>- The Government is to be commended for having introduced a measure of this character at the very commencement of the first session of the Federal Parliament. They have been guided and I have no doubt profited by, the experience gained in the various States regarding the public service. They recognise the advisability of introducing a measure of this character as one of their very first duties, and I am glad to see that in introducing the Bill the Government have, as far as possible, endeavoured to graft from the Acts of the States those sections which are good, and to exclude those which have been found to be bad. I do not regard the proposal as absolutely perfect. It is capable of improvement in committee. But it is .in honest attempt to deal with a very complicated question. No matter how good an Act we may pass, no matter how perfect the regulations with regard to the public service may be, our legislation will fail in its object if the commissioner to be appointed is not a man of exceptional parts. The whole success of this Bill depends upon the capacity of the commissioner appointed to administer it. Now, with regard to inspectors, I have very grave doubts whether six inspectors will be sufficient, because the duties of an inspector will be far more than the name implies. It will be the duty of these inspectors to visit the departments in the various States which have been taken over by the Commonwealth and to make recommendations, I take it, to the commissioner. .These recommendations will deal with increments and in some cases with appointments, and I hardly think that an inspector for each State will be sufficient. I should also like to impress upon the honorable member who has temporary charge of this Bill the desirability of appointing inspectors who will represent as far as possible the various divisions of the service which will be created. What I mean is this. I do not want to see all clerical inspectors appointed, or inspectors all of whom have had only professional experience, but I think it is desirable that some of the inspectors, at any rate, should be men of professional training, and some of them with clerical experience. We will take the Postal department for instance. That is a department in which they have a great number of clerical officers, and at the 'same time branches which are, to some extent, of a technical character. For instance, there is the electrical branch, including the telephone branch. In matters of this kind an inspector should be appointed who has a technical knowledge, because, as I have already stated, it will be the duty of the inspectors to assess the value of the services rendered by the different officers. Some honorable member suggested the question whether it is the intention of the Government to level up or level down the salaries ; that is to say, whether the salaries of the public servants generally are to be lowered to the standard adopted in Tasmania. I take it that the object of the Government will be not to level down, but to gauge and to fix the salaries in the different States according to the services actually performed in those States. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that, the matter has not been overlooked. Whilst dealing with the schedule, there is another point to which I desire to draw attention and that is with regard to the classification of females We have the 4th and 5th classes with salaries ranging from Â£110 to Â£140 per annum. Now, according to the provisions of the Bill it will be necessary for those who are engaged under this particular heading to pass an examination before they can be raised from the 5th class maximum of Â£110 to Â£140, whereas taking the males in the 5th class they are allowed to go light on to a salary of Â£160 a year without passing any examination at all. J think that is unfair, as I do not see why the women of the service should have to pass an examination in order to reach a certain salary, whereas men and boys are allowed to pass right on to that salary without having to undergo any such test. More than that, we must deal with this matter in a broader spirit. If we are going to admit - as we have admitted - women into the public service, and they are capable of doing men's work, we must give them men's wages, otherwise we shall be 'bringing the wages of the men down to the rates of pay given to women, and none of us want to see that. I want to deal justly with the women in the service, and give them the salaries to which they are entitled by the work they perform. </para>

                            <para>- An honorable member interjected just now that certain postal and telegraphic officials in New South Wales were paid starvation rates. I admit at once that, considering the long hours- which postal officials and telegraph operators have to serve, and the close attention which they have to give to their work, they are not paid sufficiently high salaries in New South Wales. More than that, the custom has grown up there, particularly since the Public Service Board has been established, to deduct so much from the salaries of postal and telegraphic officers on account of the rental value of the quarters which they occupy. Whilst there is a semblance of fairness about that deduction, it must be borne in mind that the Government would have to pay some one - a caretaker - to look after these places in any event, and that the amount which the Government would' have to pay such a caretaker ought to be taken into consideration in making the reduction. I think in many cases - in fact, I know of my own personal knowledge of many cases - excessive rents have been deducted from the salaries of these officers. </para>

                            <para>- The greatest complaint I have to make against this Bill is that there appears to be no appeal whatever from the decision of the commissioner. We have admitted, as far as the railway service of New South Wales is concerned, the principle of the right of appeal, for a Bill has been passed there which allows the servants of the Railway Commissioners the right to appeal. </para>

                            <para>- I would not be quite sure at what stage the appeal is allowed, but I believe that public opinion is in favour of a board of appeal being established for the members of the public service, and I would like to see some such provision introduced into this Bill. A Bill making some such proposal was introduced into the Lower House of New South Wales, but it did not pass, owing to the prorogation of Parliament. Now, I know from my own experience, during the short period 1 was in the public service in my younger days, that many officers are kept back owing to the peculiarities or the state of the liver of their superior officers, and I know, on the other hand, of other officers who, for some reason or other, have been shoved along, and I think it rather hard that an officer who may consider that he has been treated unfairly should have no right of appeal. I do not think that the Appeal Court would he used very frequently, but the very fact of its existence would afford a guarantee that justice would be done in making these promotions. Now I would like to say a word or two with regard to temporary employment. I am one of those who think that the clause that allows of a Minister putting on hands temporarily is one that is subject to a great deal of abuse. I have known men to be put on temporarily and to be kept on for five years, and in some cases they are still employed as temporary hands. I hope nothing of that kind will be done under our system. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, I hope there will be nothing of that kind in this case. I think that when a man has served for over twelve months it is time his position should be considered, and that a decision should be given as to whether he is to be any longer regarded as a temporary or permanent officer. The honorable member for Gippsland has put his finger upon - I will not call it a weak spot in the Bill, because I do not know whether or not the matter is provided for in the Bill - but he drew attention to what is certainly a very important matter, namely, the selection of candidates for the public service. I think that the greatest care should be exercised in the selection of candidates, and that the men who are selected for the service should have good constitutions. More than that, I would make provision such as we have in the Police Act in New South Wales, under which even the Inspector-General cannot accept an applicant for the police force unless he has a certificate from the medical officer to the effect that he is physically fit. </para>

                            <para>- Or in a State's service. And for reasons of economy, which should certainly be practised at the outset of our proceeding, I think the contemplation very desirable. The inspectors will, I take it, all be members of the different State services. I could point to an officer in Tasmania who, beyond all comparison, would be the man to act as inspector for that State - that is the present Auditor-General. Those appointments could be made at very inconsiderable cost, and would make matters much easier for the Government. There is a provision in clause 6, sub-clause 4, which to my mind, while it opens the door to the appointment of those inspectors from the body of the services, also opens the way to the appointment to the service of some one from outside - an appointment which might prejudice the great body of civil servants. </para>

                            <para>- Then it would be a bit of bad administration. In sub-clause 5 of clause 8, which deals with the enforced retirement of excess officers, there is a provision which will probably prove exceedingly harsh to a number of civil servants of the Commonwealth. The time must come very shortly when there will be a large excess of officers. </para>

When the uniform Tariff has been passed, and when the bookkeeping system has been abolished, the Customs staff will be greatly in excess, or at any rate some degree in excess, of its requirements. I am not objecting so much to the enforced retirement of these men as to the fact that they are to be retired with out any sort of allowance, gratuity, or pension except the very small amount they would receive in their own States under the conditions on which they left the State service for the Commonwealth service. I am sure honorable members of this House would not desire to see men turned out of office. </para>

                            <para>- I see that this again is all subject to the veto of the Governor-General, or more correctly speaking, the Ministry. That would not be a final Court of Appeal, but its decision would rest ultimately upon the approval of the Ministry, and it would really be a court of investigation only. My idea is to constitute a final Court of Appeal, and to let them decide as to the merits of a case. I do not know that I shall trouble the House with any further remarks. This is a Bill essentially for committee work, and we may all very well join hands in considering a measure of this kind, and try to make it as perfect as possible. With all the aggregated experience of the various States we should by this time be in a position to so frame a Bill that, whilst on the one hand we shall not take away from the Ministry their responsibility to this House, we shall on the other hand do the service full justice by striking a happy mean between direct Ministerial responsibility and the independence of the service generally. I hope that in committee this happy mean will be found, as I believe that is the real crux of the difficulty which has to' be solved in connexion with public service administration. </para>

                        <para>- That is probably the reason for the difference of opinion. In South Australia they have no board, and they are asking for it. Now, the principal provisions in this measure are those which relate to appointments and the promotion and retirement of officers, and the Government, propose in this Bill that the chief control of these matters shall be vested in a single commissioner. I heard some suggestion that a board of three would be preferable to a single commissioner, but I do not agree ' with that. 1 believe that if we have one commissioner we shall know on whom to fix the responsibility. The experience of most of us is that boards do not provide the most satisfactory method for controlling and carrying out executive work, because of the difficulty of fixing the responsibility. As far as appointments in the clerical branch are concerned, of course the Commissioner will have very little scope - that is very evident from the provisions of the Bill. He will not need to exercise very much judgment in the selection of candidates. The ages of applicants for admission to the service are limited to from 16 to 21 ;years - with some exceptions, which I need not now mention. Then out of the number of candidates who submit themselves there will be first the limitation by lot, which is a practice I am not very certain I agree with, because it seems to me to be distinctly contrary to the best interests of the service to see lads who have been specially educated to fit them for the clerical branch thrown out of competition by the cast of a die. Probably the best men would not be able to present themselves for examination at all. Of course we know what the object is - it is supposed that there will be such a rush fc r appointments to the service that there mast be some means of limiting the number of applications; but I cannot say that I like the proposed system. It will inevitably shut out some of the best of the men, and the element of chance operating to shut out a great many men, who would be most suitable, seems to me to be objectionable. After a certain number have been thrown out by this method of choosing by lot, those who remain in must undergo a competitive examination, after the Chinese system, under which the passing in competitive examinations is the only entrance to the public service. I do not know that, the Chinese system has been an unqualified success. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to compare the system provided for in the Bill with the Chinese system, because I presume that the subjects in which candidates for our public service will be .examined will have more bearing upon the work which they will afterwards be called upon to dp than have the subjects of the Chinese examinations. As a matter of fact, I do not know that anything better than a competitive examination can be devised for the selection of the brightest and best of the boys who present themselves. Of course the examination test is not a perfect one, because some persons develop late in life, and the precocious lads may not grow up to be the most capable men. Still we must be practical, and I do not see what test could be substituted for the competitive examination. In the branches of the service other than the clerical division, the Commissioner and his inspectors will make the selection. I would like, however, to draw attention to the provision that boys of any age may be employed as messengers. </para>

                            <para>- They should be given an opportunity to pass the examination, and to enter either the clerical or the general division of the service. I think that it will be a pity to take on more boys as messengers than can afterwards be absorbed in the service. We do not want to run the country with boy labour but in the past a greater number of boys have been taken on in the public service than there has been room for. In some of the railway shops a great deal of the work has been done by apprentices, the object of taking on boys being, not to teach them a trade, but to obtain cheap labour. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. At one time there was a suspicion that this gentleman, who was said to have a great deal of influence with the Railway Commissioners, received special favours from the men, and that would naturally happen if he could use such influence. However, I do not think that that state of things exists now, and I have referred to the case only as an illustration of a kind of influence which I regard as highly objectionable. The possibility of political influence being of service makes things very unpleasant for Members of Parliament, and all who have been in political life- for any length of time have been very much worried by constant applications for billets, or what is still worse, by applications from men who are already in the Government service to use influence to obtain promotion for them. One cannot find fault with the man who is out of work and who uses every endeavour to obtain employment - such a man has a right to do what he can for himself ; but I think it is a good thing to take from Members of Parliament all influence in regard to appointments, so that there can be no suspicion that advantages are being given to any political party, which is the real objection to political influence. The honorable and learned member for Parkes said that in his opinion the non-political administration of the Railway Commissioners had been a striking success, and I think that, taking all the States into consideration, it has been a success in the matter of removing the fixing of rates for the carriage of merchandise and the general management of the railways from the sphere of political influence. But I do not think that it has been such a striking success in regard to the control of the men in the service. It has been said that, as a result of the removal of the railways from Ministerial control, fewer cases of grievance have been brought before Parliament ; but that statement has not been borne out by South Australian experience, because, since the appointment of Railway Commissioners in South Australia, the Legislature of that State has had more railway grievances brought before it than were brought before it in the past. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that so many grievances of individuals have been brought forward, but cases in which a number of men are affected have frequently been brought under the notice of Parliament, and the Minister for Trade and Customs will bear me out in the statement that, since the appointment of Railway Commissioners, an immense amount of the time of the South Australian Parliament has been occupied in discussing the grievances of railway men. One way in which the railway commissioners - and we can give this as typical non-political management of a public service - could very much lessen the raising of questions in Parliament, and do a great deal to prevent grievance, is by encouraging, as far as possible, organizations in the service'. The more organizations are encouraged by the commissioners, the less friction there is. I was president of a railway service association for several years, and during that time the Railway Commissioners encouraged us as far as possible, and met us in every way they could. The result was that most of the individual grievances were threshed out within the organization itself, and in very few cases was it found necessary to go before the commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. The commissioner must look all round the service, but he may come to the conclusion on very insufficient evidence that the men are not required. He may be just as likely to come to that conclusion as in the case of an individual officer who may be charged by the head of his department with having done something wrong ; but in the one case there is to be a board of inquiry, while in the other case the matter is left entirely to the sweet will of the commissioner. I draw attention to these points, not so much to complain, as to show that while we are careful to preserve the rights of the civil servants against unjust dismissal, if there be a suggestion that an officer has done wrong, yet, on the other hand, we are not nearly so careful in cases where there may be an excess of officers. 1 do not know that I would not vote for an appeal board to look into those latter cases if such a proposal were made. With regard to the question of life insurance, in South Australia, so far as the railway services are concerned, there is a plan similar to that proposed in the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I have not compared the plans closely, and possibly there are some differences. I am talking about the necessity laid down in the Bill of going to some approved assurance office. In the Education department in South Australia the teachers have what is called a superannuation fund, and in a Bill brought forward in that State quite recently by a Minister similar proposals have been adopted, dealing with the whole civil service. A royal commission has also gone into the question pretty fully, and recommended the superannuation fund as against life insurance for the service generally. I ask the Govern- . merit just to look into these matters, and to consider whether the proposal favoured in South Australia would not be better than the method suggested in the Bill. Then in South Australia, when a holiday occurs, it is as far as possible observed on a Monday, This of course does not apply to Good Friday. Christmas Day, or holidays of that kind, but as far as possible all public holidays are held on a Monday, the object' being, of course, to give a longer holiday, which is of much more value. Public servants in South Australia have holiday from Saturday midday till Tuesday following, and it works very well, enabling them, if they choose, to go away into the country. I do not think there has been the slightest complaint since the practice has been adopted, and if it could be adopted generally in the Commonwealth service, I am quite sure it would give satisfaction. </para>

Some amendments have been proposed, which I shall certainly support. We want to examine the proposals in committee, so as to get what I am sure is the object of every member of this House, a Bill which will produce the very best results and give the greatest possible incentive to the members of the service to put forth their best work. </para>

                        <para>- I had intended to reserve the remarks which I have to make upon this Bill for committee, but looking at the clauses affecting the principles of the measure, I thought I could not do better than speak upon them at the second reading stage, indicating my attitude with regard to them without waiting till the particular clauses come under review in committee.. With regard to other clauses, I will leave them until they are reached. It strikes me that we have in this Bill adopted a number of provisions which are not found in the legislation of any State except Victoria. One of those provisions is in regard to putting the Defence department by itself as a branch of the public service. If honorable members will refer to clause 1 2, sub-clause 2, they will find it provided there that - </para>

                            <para>- Faith has been described as the substance of tilings hoped for. Honorable members may readily trace in the Bill some such design as that which I have described. While excluding political influence, it was intended to retain for the Executive a portion of that oversight which is exercised by a board of directors. The main body of the public departments may be compared with the main administrative branches of any one of the great commercial undertakings which have direct dealings with the public, while the permanent heads may be taken to represent, in a general way, persons in the position of the managers of the bank. In addition to these officers there is in a bank a body of inspectors who move about in the service and keep the head office acquainted with what is being done in the branches. They have an oversight of the men employed in the branches, and make a study of their capacities and of their promise. The benefits which arise from the work of inspectors are sought to be secured under the Bill by the appointment of a commissioner - who might, perhaps, be more properly described as a chief inspector - and of a number of inspectors who will act under him. Several honorable members have referred to the commissioner as if it were the intention that he should take the place which has been occupied in this and other States by boards of Public Service Commissioners, and to, so to speak, make him the governor and ruler of the service. But, as other honorable members perceived, the intention of the framers of the measure does not go so far as that. It is sought to keep the permanent heads of departments responsible for the working of their departments as bodies dealing with the public, whother in the collection of Customs or in the transaction of the work of a great industrial enterprise, such as the Post and Telegraph department. Under the permanent heads there will be their deputies and chief officers in each State, and under these, other officers responsible in their turn, the responsibility for the working and efficiency of the department stretching like a chain from the permanent head down to the humblest employe in the service. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member is speaking of his " Illumination." The inspectors are as far as possible to put new life into the public service. Neither the commissioner nor the inspectors are to be the persons who, to use an Americanism, will " run " the service. They are rather to be outside critics of the departments, who will make them toe the mark] and will see, too, that fair play is done to the servants of the State. They are to be appointed to protect the service against the permanent heads of the departments, and, if any permanent head should prove likely to be malleable by political fingers, it will be their duty to protect him against improper political influence. So that they may carry out these duties efficiently, the commissioner and inspectors under him are protected by a seven years1 tenure of office. </para>

I do not receive the criticism that the period is too long, nor do I. receive any criticism of any provision in the Bill, with impatience. It has been recognised on both sides of tine Chamber, and by no one more' than by the honorable member for Wentworth, who is acting at present in the capacity of leader of the Opposition, that this is not a party scheme, but a measure to which we can all address ourselves with the knowledge we possess, without a single thought of our party relations and positions in this Chamber, 'so that the country may be given the best possible service. </para>

                            <para>- That is precisely my opinion. There is a good deal to be said in committee - and my speech is not designed to deprecate discussion - about the relations of the three powers provided for in the Bill ; but, if honorable members have the broad rough outline of what is intended, as I have given it, they will be better able to interpret the provisions of the measure. I venture to say that the powers vested in the commissioner are intended to be far larger, ' and are, as a matter of fact, far larger, than ' many honorable members have yet realized, because they turn upon the comparatively, short phrase in clause 5 which defines his position. The second sentence in that clause reads as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- To alter the rainfall? No - unfortunately that is not included in his list of duties. The power of the commissioner is only outlined. I confess it has not been sought to tie him down to a set of hard and fast requirements. That would more impede than assist him, and lead to complications which we cannot foresee and against which we cannot provide. We have given the commissioner a high position, with great responsibility and a splendid tenure. That responsibility includes the reporting upon everything done and giving his opinion thereon. </para>

                            <para>- I think not ; but I was just about to deal with the powers of the Governor-General. The Governor-General has a power over both the permanent head and the commissioner, and of course he is independent of both, just as permanent heads and the commissioner are made, as far as they can be under the circumstances, independent of the Governor-General. The permanent head who does his duty - who manages his department and keeps it in an efficient condition - registers by nomination to the Minister, his requirements. So far as his nomination is followed he is responsible in the fullest sense, and must be held to that responsibility if we are to have an efficient administration. So far as his nominations are ignored, in those particulars he is free from responsibility, which falls on the head of the Government of the day or on the commissioner. The Commissioner on his side is in precisely the same position. He is entirely independent of the permanent head and entirely independent of the Government. He is in a secure position, and has a staff of men of great knowledge and trust - men picked by himself, who keep him in touch with the service all over the continent. With all that knowledge he makes his recommendations, and where those recommendations are accepted his responsibility follows, but where his recommendations are ignored, the responsibility falls on other shoulders. </para>

                            <para>- I am coining to that. The Governor-General has in two or three respects an important responsibility in this measure - if he has great powers they carry great responsibilities. Under this Bill promotions in the clerical division are made slowly, regularly, and in very short stages from subdivision to subdivision. In clause 21 there is the power of expediting promotions. The Governor-General can under special circumstances hasten this ordinarily slow process by leaping over classes if necessary, and in this respect, as in every other place where he can exercise any power, there is a triple guarantee. There is the nomination of the permanent head, the approval of the Minister, and the recommendation of the commissioner. If these three are agreed, then it is possible for the promotion to take place. If these three do not agree, the Governor-General has not the special power which he has in relation to two other clauses to which I am about to call attention. He can only exercise the power in clause 21 with the consent of the permanent head and the commissioner, and they with his consent, so that we have a triple check on any possible abuse of power ; and then we have in this case, as in the other two clauses to which I shall call attention, the absolute safeguard that the whole of the circumstances of the case in which the ordinary course has been departed from - the whole of the papers relating to it - are laid before Parliament. Parliament has the opportunity with all this material before it to see the circumstances under which the Minister, commissioner, and permanent head have agreed that the regular routine in the service for advancement shall be departed from, and some favoured man caused to leap over the heads of his fellows. It can be done only under the triple guarantee and in the full sight and with the full knowledge and tacit concurrence of Parliament. </para>

In regard to clause 37 honorable members will find again that when an appointment is made without an examination, the same triple precautions are taken. But here a special negative authority is vested in the Governor-General. When the permanent head has reported, and the commissioner has nominated, the Governor-General agrees that some person may be appointed to the service without examination and without probation. I am not taking honorable members through the whole of the clauses in which there are' other precautions to which it is not necessary at the present time to allude ; but where the Governor-General does not see reason to agree with the permanent head or the commissioner, and he has reason to believe that the persons whom they nominated, though they may be fit for the post, are not so fit as some other person, and that other person is outside the service, and is more competent and more deserving of being admitted without examination and without probation, then the Governor in Council can reject the nomination of the two, and continues to reject their nominations until he is satisfied that the person at last selected by them is one who in every way suits the requirements of the situation. </para>

                            <para>- That comes under their immunities and rights under the Constitution. I should say, speaking off-hand, that the passing of an examination would be an element which the Minister would be justified in requiring when making promotions of those who had been taken over. Nor would it be a hardship to expect them to pass the examination, seeing that it relates to the duties they would have to discharge. The other matter provided for in this Bill is one which will strike a Victorian, at all events, as not a new departure in legislation, so" far as that State is concerned, although there it has hardly come into operation yet. The principle of placing seniority in the second place, and very much in the second place, and of promoting ability, obtains throughout this Bill. We lay it down that advancement is to depend upon efficiency and aptitude, and not upon length of service - the time a man has sat upon an office stool, the time he has driven a quill, the number of pages he has filled with writing, lt is his efficiency in the discharge of his duties that is to lead to his promotion. That will be a new departure at all .events in Victoria, and strikes the keynote of what is intended in the administration of the Commonwealth departments. </para>
