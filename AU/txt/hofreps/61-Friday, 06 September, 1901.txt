                        <para>- I hardly understand what the honorable and learned member refers to. We have no tabulated statements made up to 30th June, but they are made up to 31st December. If my honorable friend refers to the ordinary departmental receipts, I may say that information regarding those "will form part of my financial statement. However, if the honorable and learned member will give me a memorandum of what he desires, I will endeavour to get the information. </para>

                            <para>- My principle is - and ! do not generally play to the gallery - that the large majority of the people of Australia have said absolutely that these alien races must not enter our territory. In New South Wales a poll tax of Â£100 was put on Chinamen. That was practically prohibition ; and when we regard this question at all, we regard it as one of prohibition. Let us consider for a moment, after these general remarks, the details of the Bill. What does the Bill say We are to do ? The Bill is not merely drastic in one respect, but it is absolutely unfair and unpatriotic in other respects. It says, forsooth, that every man, not a regular resident, who comes to these shores may be asked to write out in .the English language a sentence or paragraph of 50 words. In the first place, we have British subjects, within 200 miles of London, who have never spoken a word of English in their lives - Welshmen. We have also a similar population in Ireland, but only to a small extent. Then we have the French Canadians, who are some of the best citizens, of the British Empire. But- the Bill will allow the educated negro of South Carolina to come in, while we shut out our own fellow-citizens from Canada. How futile this will' be? We want to keep out the Japanese labourer. Why, Japan is becoming at present a highly-educated nation. English is being; taught in the schools there, and in a few years there will not be a Japanese labourer who will not be able to fulfil this test. It is not the educational test that is required: - and that is the dishonesty of the Bill - but it is the avoidance of race taint. What is the good of our saying anything else - saying one thing and meaning another ? . I, of course, feel that the work we have to do is a very unpleasant work, lt is a work which every man must feel is only a matter of stern necessity, as is capital punishment in the case of a murderer. But if it is to be done, let us do it thoroughly, completely, and honestly. </para>

To me it has a ring of genuineness about it that I am delighted to hear from the opposite side of the House I sincerely hope that my honorable friend will assist the Government to carry out all that he has indicated. I am quite sure that if he is prepared to recognise this as a measure, not of party, but involving great interests to this nation, there is no honorable member who will not join with him in making the prohibition as effectual as he desires. The honorable member will pardon me, however, if I say it seems to me that he has occupied as much time in defending the interests of the ship-owner as he has in defending those of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will pardon me if I say it seems to me that the proposal he makes is one that is fraught with very great risk of loss of time, and the prospect of much diplomatic communication with the Home Government, and that while the usage is being settled the difficulties and evils he has alluded to will be going on. There are a number of people who appear to think that this danger is not as great as it really is. The census for 1880 indicated, however, that there were some 80,000 aliens of the character described by the honorable member for Wentworth in Australia at that time. That 80,000, according to the census of 1890, had increased to 90,000, and there is every reason to believe that the census now in course of completion will indicate the alarming fact that there are something like 100,000 Chinese, Japanese, and other alien races in Australia. </para>

The remarks made by the honorable member for Wentworth have come to me with a very great amount of surprise, and I must say that I welcome them. The Government cannot do better than welcome the hearty co-operation of the acting leader of the Opposition. If I understand the policy of the Government, and if I understand the desire of the people of Australia aright, they are determined that Australia shall be kept free from alien invasion and contamination. That being the case, the problem we have to solve is what is the best way to do it. The Government think the course they have proposed is the best, and the quickest way of carrying out that object at the present time. </para>

                            <para>-Under regulation and agreement supervised by a Japanese agent. Surely the honorable member for Wentworth will not contend that that is not a phase of immigration which is more dangerous and insidious than even open immigration. I have found, in connexion with labour troubles, that a large number of men were brought out to Australia in the early days, under contract, to defeat the ends which trade unionists and strikers had in view. If my honorable friend is going to be consistent he will recognise that it is a question of coloured labour, and as it is a question of coloured labour, surely the position of the kanaka must be inseparable from this discussion.' If we are going to have a white Australia it is just as necessary to prohibit aliens brought in under contract in the way that kanakas are brought to Australia as aliens introduced under any other conditions. </para>

The measure is a means to an end. If it will not effect that end and my honorable friends can show a better means I shall be quite prepared to support them. I hope we will soon pass the second reading of this Bill, and go into committee and make the clauses as effectual as my honorable friend has indicated, in order that we may have a veritable white Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I think that from this section of the House one may, without presumption, congratulate the acting leader of the Opposition upon the speech he has made to-day. It seems tome that he not only stated the position taken up by the majority, and undoubtedly the large majority of the people of Australia, with clearness but with moderation and firmness, and in a way which I think will commend itself to the opinion of the greater number of the the people. While it may be said that the feeling in this Chamber, even in this Parliament, is so decided upon this matter that debate is unnecessary, yet it must be recognised that the step we are taking, although it is one upon which the people are unanimous, is in itself so important and so likely to lead at least to diplomatic negotiations with the older land, that it is due to the statesmen of the old country, at least, that our reasons should be stated clearly, and that none ' of them should be overlooked in regard to the decision which we hope this Parliament will arrive at. In view of that, I feel it is not necessary to apologize for supplementing, to some extent, the reasons put forward by the acting leader of the Opposition. As far as I am concerned, the objection I have to the mixing of these coloured people with the white people of Australia - although I admit it is to a large extent tinged with considerations of an industrial nature - lies in the main in the possibility and probability of racial contamination. I think we should gauge this- matter, not alone by the abstract possibilities of the case, but by those considerations which appeal to our ordinary human weaknesses and prejudices. The question is whether we would desire that our sisters or our brothers should be married into 'any of these races to which we object. If these people are not such as we can meet upon an equality, and not such as we can feel that it is no disgrace to intermarry with, and not such as we c'an expect to give us an infusion of blood that will tend to the raising of our standard of life, and to the improvement of the race, we should be foolish in the extreme if we did not exhaust every means of preventing them from coming to this land, which we have made our own. The racial aspect of the question, in my opinion, is the larger and more important one ; but the industrial aspect also has to be considered. There is a good deal in the contention put forward by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports in regard to the conversion of a number of people on the question of coloured immigration, because of the ramifications of the coloured races having extended of late to a much greater degree than was the case only a short time ago. We know that a few years ago business men - speaking by and large - looked upon the Chinese or other coloured undesirables as men who could be very well tolerated, because they took the place of labourers, of men who might be unreliable, or not quite so cheap, but when it was found that these Orientals possessed all the cunning and acumen necessary to fit them, for conducting business affairs, and that their cheapness of living was carried into business matters as well as into ordinary labouring work, a marked alteration of opinion took place among business men, so far as the competition of the "heathen Chinee" was concerned. At the present time in Sydney, we have whole streets which are practically given up to the businesses conducted by Chinese, Syrians, and other coloured aliens, and one cannot go to-day into more than five towns of any importance in the country districts of New South Wales without finding two, three, or perhaps half-a-dozen coloured storekeepers apparently doing a thriving business. In each and every avenue of life we find the competition of the coloured races insidiously creeping in, and if we are to maintain the standard of living we think necessary, in order that our people may be brought up with a degree of comfort, and with scholastic advantages which will conduce to the improvement and general advancement of the nation, some pause must be made in regard to the extension of the competition of the coloured aliens generally. Another aspect of the question is that in the northern parts of Australia, both on the east and on the west coast, we find that coloured people have gained more than a footing - they have practically secured control. In the northern parts of Western Australia the pearl fisheries are being run with coloured divers, and large numbers of these men - Malays and other coloured aliens - are still being imported under contract to work as divers upon the pearl-shelling grounds. I do not say that these men are allowed to overrun the State ; but they have established settlements on the coast from which they work the fisheries. </para>

                            <para>- That information is very interesting in itself, but, unfortunately,, it does not touch on the main question to which I was referring immediately before the Prime Minister gave the figures. I was. urging the desirability of having figures to show the experience under the Natal Act, as passed in New South Wales, Western Australia, and, I believe, in Tasmania ; but these figures, it appears, are not available. I have been able, however, to get some figures with reference to Western Australia from the beginning of this year. That State, I believe, has only recently begun to differentiate, for statistical purposes, between coloured people. As I mentioned, incidentally a few nights ago, when this matter was under discussion, the information from Western Australia shows that during the first three months of the present year, there was an increase in coloured immigration by some 130 to 140 people. </para>

That is the whole objection I have- to the Bill. I quite sympathize with the object of the measure, but I contend that under its provisions it will be possible for a man to pass the examination and still be one of the most objectionable immigrants imaginable.

                            <para>- Just so. With the Oriental, as a rule, the more he is educated the worse man he is likely to be from our point of view. The more educated, the more cunning he becomes, and the more able, with his peculiar ideas of social and business morality, to cope with the people here. I do not think there is any advantage in restricting the admission of coloured people to those who are educated ; and, in any case, I contend that the number which will filter through under the Government's proposal will still be sufficiently large to constitute a great menace to the well-being of the people as a whole. Then, it is undesirable, to say the least of it, that we should attempt to place any' bar in the way of white people, as is proposed by the Bill. We know that many uneducated white people, are proved later to be valuable colonists. I am not now speaking df one particular race as against another, but we can at least say that Great Britain has benefited to a very large degree in the past by the steady invasion by a portion of the more northerly European races, which lias been going on during many centuries. That invasion has helped to build up a national character which is unique, and which certainly is in no way inferior to that of any other European nation. With this experience behind us, it would be an error to pass any legislation which would place a bar in the- way of immigration from ' other European nations, so long as that immigration does not get beyond reasonable bounds - so long as immense hordes do not come over. While it continues merely in driblets of people of an enterprising character, who wish to make a better living for themselves than there is a chance of their doing in their own countries it would be a mistake to interpose a barrier. We have room for every man who has a standard of living equal to our own, and whose general tone is. in no way inferior to that of our own people. We have room for all such in Australia, and I for one would be slow indeed to put a bar in the way of their coming here, unless, of course, it is shown that we cannot achieve our object in any other way. But I contend that it is possible to achieve our object in another way. I believe that we can get passed the provision of which I have given notice ; and here I would like to say that I do not intend to press the latter -part of the amendment, which has reference to Pacific islanders, the Government having given notice of their intention to deal with this in another Bill. My proposal is to insert a sub-clause (a) in clause 4, prohibiting the immigration of any person who is an aboriginal native of Asia or Africa, and I believe that the Colonial-office will not be likely to reject a Bill containing such a provision. If the Colonial-office authorities are likely to reject such a Bill once, I do not think they are likely to reject it a second time. If, however, as some honorable members contend, the Bill is rejected a second time, then, as I said yesterday, the sooner we understand what our powers are, and how far this autonomous government with which we are supposed to have been endowed is a reality or how far it is a mockery, the better it will be for all. While I entertain no manner of doubt as to my proposal going through, if it be carried by this and the other Chamber, it is highly desirable that we should thoroughly understand our position in regard to our powers for the preservation of our own interests. It was suggested that, owing to an amendment of the character I have indicated, the Bill might be postponed for an indefinite period while negotiations are in progress, - and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports asked what was going to happen in the meantime. But the Government have that latent power, which all Governments possess, to stop anything in the interim which is likely to be a menace to the people as a whole. </para>

In some of the States it would be possible even under the present laws in regard to immigration - and these laws obtain until the federal law be passed - to place a restriction on the immigration of British subjects. The Natal Act, for instance, will operate in New South Wales until the federal legislation takes its place. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable member. When considering the possibility of this legislation being unduly delayed, I was endeavouring to regard the case in its worst aspect from my point of view. My contention is that we are not likely to have any undue delay - that there is no probability of the Royal assent being refused - when it is understood that the people here have definitely made up their minds in favour of legislation of this character. I regret to notice the absence of some provision dealing with the importation of labour under contract, and I have indicated an amendment dealing with this phase of immigration. In America, there has been legislation of the kind I suggest in force for some little time. I notice that one of the Melbourne newspapers is attempting to make merry over the probability of a bishop brought from England to govern one of the denominations here, or a professor for a college, being stopped under the proposed clause. But, so far as such cases are concerned, I am quite willing to make exemptions. </para>

As I know that other honorable members desire to speak, I merely wish to add that I am pleased the honorable member for Wentworth has upset this show today. I am going to assist in getting into this Bill a clause providing for the absolute exclusion of undesirable aliens. No danger will result from such legislation, because the men in Great Britain are sensible. Lord Chatham declared on one occasion that if he had been in America he would have fought with the Americans. The American and Canadian rebellions have shown Great Britain that it is folly to interfere with a free people when they are determined to struggle for their rights. The British people are sensible upon these questions. We are here upon a continent set apart by the Creator exclusively for a Southern empire - for a Southern nation - and it is our duty to preserve this island continent for all eternity to the white race, irrespective of where they may come from. </para>

                        <para>- Yesterday, I had the honour to present a petition in connexion with this Bill from the Australian Natives' Association. That petition set forth the sentiments of the native-born Australians, and prayed this House, as speedily as possible, to pass into law some measure which would have the effect of keeping Australia white. Those exact phrases were not used, but they convey the meaning and sentiment of the nativeborn of Australia. It was, therefore, with more than ordinary pleasure that I listened to the deliverance of the honorable member for Wentworth this morning. His manly style and straightforward utterance must give pleasure to those who have long felt that Australia is in serious danger from the influx particularly of coloured aliens. I must candidly confess that I hardly expected such a deliverance from the honorable member, and I am the more pleased to find that I have been disappointed. Whether or not the proposals of the Government are sufficient to carry out what we have in view remains to be seen. That those proposals are not such as the Government would under other circumstances have put forward I verily believe. They are proposals put forward because of the necessities surrounding our Imperial connexion. We were told by the Prime Minister, when introducing the Bill, not in so many words, but certainly in effect, that that so far as his Ministry was concerned, they would be just as strong in their desire to exclude aliens as the honorable member for Wentworth himself would be, and that they were equally desirous of preserving Australia absolutely white with any other honorable member. The Prime Minister pointed out, as he had a right to point out, that in consequence of our Imperial connexion and the difficulties that are likely to arise in regard to British subjects, it became necessary to frame the Bill in a way that was not exactly palatable to himself, and it certainly is not palatable to a large section, if not the whole, of the honorable members of this House. Speaking for myself alone I would infinitely prefer to adopt the method suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth, and state in the Bill, in a straightforward manner exactly what we want to do. We want to exclude absolutely every kind of coloured immigrant. Let us put that desire on the face of the Bill and ask the Home authorities to support us. The test must come some day as to which of the two great powers, so to speak, is best able to say what is proper for Australia ; whether on the one hand the Government of Australia or, on the other, the Imperial Government is to have that right. For my own part I think there can be no doubt as to which of the two is the better qualified to speak, and to speak authoritatively. Those having a full knowledge of the alien question, and of Australian public sentiment, those who are able to appreciate the danger of these vast hordes, should they be cast loose; those who are in touch with the feelings and aspirations of Australia ought to be best qualified to say what is most suitable for Australia. The test must come sooner or later, and when it does come, we want it to come in a way that will provoke the least possible friction. In a matter of this kind, where the internal administration in connexion with a matter which does not extend beyond the limits of the Commonwealth is in question, we have the best right to make our views heard, and the best opportunity of making the test to which I have referred. When we were discussing the Postal Bill the other day, some similar proposal was put forward for excluding coloured labour. I was delighted to see the proposal carried which was then put forward, but I think that in connexion with this Bill we shall be on very much firmer ground in taking the stand, that I hope we will take, in excluding these undesirable immigrants. The honorable member for Wentworth said that the Bill was absolutely a fraud. I do not know that that is so. It may be that it will prove to be ineffectual in its operation. It may be that the educational test, perhaps, will not be sufficient for the purpose in view. Like the honorable member I fear that will be so, but I wish to emphasize the fact that the Bill is what we are forced to take because of the conditions which surround the subject, and it is not what we our ourselves would desire. As to the educational test it is just as well to be reminded that the Japanese and others, particularly Indian subjects, are quite able to pass that test. Those are the very races, above all others, that we desire to keep out of Australia. The Afghans, the Cingalese, and Japanese are amongst the least desirable citizens of Australia. They do not enter upon the productive works of the country in the way in which European alien races do. For the most part they content themselves with hawking goods in the country, or taking menial occupations in the towns and cities. The hawking element has been descanted upon this morning, and every honorable member who has been in the country districts knows full well to what an extent that trade has been mopped up by the Afghans and coolies ; he knows, too, what a dreadful scourge those men have become in the back blocks of Australia. But they can all pass the educational test. There are universities in India where the coloured subjects of the King receive as good an education as we can give to any of the white subjects of the King in Australia. Some of these men - I have met some of them myself - are mathematicians of the highest, order. Some of them are scholars of repute. We have had instances of some of them entering the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge and passing all examinations there with credit to themselves and the country to which they belong. In such cases the educational test can be of no use at all. It must be absolutely worthless. In addition to these there are others who do not attend universities, but who nevertheless receive a very good education. The Japanese particularly are adopting a method of education, not merely with respect to literary subjects, but with respect to technical knowledge, which threatens to be a serious menace to Australia. Forty or fifty years ago the Germans went into the manufacturing towns of England, and made contracts with the best artisans they could secure among the trades it was proposed to establish" in Germany. Those engagements were made for a certain number of years. The men received extremely good wages. They went to Germany and taught the Germans the </para>

                            <para>- My figures are intended to include the Chinese throughout the whole of Australia, but, even though I may be a few thousands out, it is none the less a fact that there has been an immense declension during the last 50 years, and if ten-year periods are taken it will be seen that the tide of alien population is ebbing instead of flowing in. At the same time I am prepared to put upon our statute-book a provision which will really face the substance of this question and exclude coloured aliens. I have only been talking about the unnecessary timidity of Australians with reference to an invasion of the black races. In the future there may be greater danger. The superstitions which have for ages kept the Chinese at home, and which would not permit them to leave their bones in a foreign country, are gradually being weakened, perhaps under the influence of Western civilization. Until recently the Chinese would not allow mining to go on in their country because they thought that if they dug down more than 30 feet the spirits of their interred ancestors would be disturbed, and evil spirits come up and give them trouble. It was a religious principle among the Chinese that they should go home to die; and by some extraordinary process they seem to have entertained the same antipathy to leaving their bones outside their own country as did the Greeks of old. Even that form of patriotism, however, is now weakened among the Chinese, because we find that they are settling themselves permanently in parts of America and in the Straits Settlements. We have the testimony of the late Professor Pearson and others that, during the last 30 years, there have been indications of. the weakening of those superstitions which' have prevented the Chinese from becoming permanent residents in a foreign country, and an increasing tendency to settle abroad. Under these circumstances, we must make corresponding provisions against the probable pollution of the higher race in the only part of the world in which the higher white civilization has an opportunity left to develop itself. Professor Pearson points out that if we allow the northern parts of Australia to be open to the immigration of coloured races, we shall reduce the rest of Australia to the same position as the Cape found itself in owing to a similar operation being allowed in the case of Natal. The reason given by the Government of Natal for the introduction of this measure was different from that alleged by the Government here. What Natal objected to was that the immigrants from India were of the very lowest type. There were negroes in Natal already. I believe that in 1894 there were something like 500,000 negroes to some 44,000 whites. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; I am using the term in its generic sense, to cover Kaffirs -and others. What was objected to was that these low-class immigrants were being exploited by English capitalists, and there is no doubt that this labour was exploited in the Kimberley mines, and to some extent in the Transvaal. The objection being on the ground that the immigrants from India were of the lowest type, it was thought that the best test to apply would be the educational test, as the one that would prove effective. But in passing this legislation, the Natal Government did not go to the stupid length which is gone in the Bill we are now discussing. The test there was the writing out of a certain number of words in any European language. No attempt was made to exclude some of the best colonists and best agrarian settlers - such as the Germans - who might perhaps increase the virile qualities of our race. </para>

                            <para>- I know that we had to fight this question in South Australia, where there was a good deal of reluctance on the part of the Government to make a provision admitting Germans. That was not because the Government objected to German settlers, but because the Government with a determination to stick to the text, which is sometimes commendable and sometimes is not, refused to budge from the provisions as introduced. This question was raised in South Australia by men entitled more than I am to speak on behalf of Germans - men who were born in Germany and represented German constituents. I have represented a constituency, half the electors of which were Germans, and I know the degree of dissatisfaction with which the exclusion of German immigrants by means of this educational test, was met. I do not think that, at this stage, I am justified, especially after the excellent speech of the acting leader of the Opposition, in dealing more elaborately with the Bill. I repeat that I am in thorough sympathy with those who wish to preserve our race from any mixture of the lower races, and also in sympathy with those who desire to prevent such cutthroat competition in regard to wages as makes the white man a practical slave. We have to face the conditions of modern civilization. We find that in one week in Chicago, 2,000 printers were dismissed from employment owing to improved machinery, and that brick-making is now carried on by means of electricity with a saving of labour to the extent of 700 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I will accept the Prime Minister's correction, and say that the labour saved was as seven to one. All around wonderful economies are being effected in labour, and the labour market is often glutted with unemployed, in consequence of the application of these economies. There is, therefore, a justifiable desire to prevent great cutthroat competition in regard to wages, and if political machinery be used to this end, we should endeavour to see that the necessary provision is made within the letter of the measure itself. I think the Bill ought to be rejected. I do not believe in passing a makeshift, or in taking up a Bill which was opposed by the British press, and which, when introduced in the House of Commons or the House of Lords, was not proceeded with. The Bill does not deal broadly with the question of coloured labour, and the Ministry ought to have the courage to tackle the question generally. </para>

                        <para>- Like most other honorable members who have spoken, I am of opinion that we should aim directly at the object we are striving to attain, and not try to achieve it in a roundabout way. We are all agreed that the object we are striving for is to keep out the Asiatic, and I wish the Bill was also directed to keeping out the Polynesian. My warm support of the Government during the election campaign was given because I believed their desire was to maintain the purity of the race on this' continent; and I believe the Government are still in earnest in the matter. This question is far more important in the eyes of Australia than the Tariff, or any other question we are likely to discuss. The Tariff question may interest Victoria and New South Wales, and in a lesser degree the other States ; but this is a living and burning question throughout the Commonwealth. My support of the Government is not so strong or so loyal that I can remain behind them if they are going to make a retrograde movement in this matter. I have heard the condition of affairs in (Queensland referred to in this House and at public meetings outside, but I have not gone about the city of Melbourne with my eyes shut. I have seen the canker spot in every part of Australia I have visited ; and while it may be true that we have a more polyglot population in Queensland than there is elsewhere, and that in the public schools there we may see almond eyes and brown or half-brown complexions, we need not go outside Melbourne to See a similar state of affairs. I recognise the importance of the commercial and industrial competition which these people are bringing on us, but to my mind there is a much more serious aspect of the question. There is the maintenance of the purity of the race, which is more than threatened, and I believe there has been too much apathy and indifference in some of the States in regarding the question from this point of view. Otherwise we would have had a much more active crusade against this class of labour than even we have to-day. I have authorized returns from various parts of Queensland, which go to show that there has been no exaggeration in the statements made. It cannot be unknown to honorable members and to the public generally, that wherever the Asiatic congregates or hordes, there we find insanitary conditions. Unfortunately I have to accuse those who are, perhaps, the most active in the crusade against this class of labour, of being amongst those who most actively support its continuance. I refer to the working classes. We find men agitating on the platform for the exclusion of the Chinese, and yet these men are amongst the best customers of the Chinese' hawker. If these people only knew what they were buying from the Chinese, their dealings with them would fall off considerably. I have here a newspaper account of what was reported by the medical officer of Townsville: - </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Holding these views it gave me very great pleasure to hoar the address delivered by the honorable member for Wentworth. It confirmed the belief which I have previously expressed that 75 per cent, of the members of this Parliament were determined that this matter should be dealt with in no shilly-shally manner, and that we should declare in favour of reserving Australia for the white races. I wish to say a few words in regard to the educational test which is prescribed by clause 4. I am very sorry indeed that the Government have deemed it necessary that the test should be the ability to write 50 words in the English language. I have had perhaps as good, if not better, opportunities of knowing the value of the services which the German and Scandinavian races have rendered to Australia, as have most honorable members. It might be thought that because a very large number of the settlers in the constituency which I have the honour to represent are Germans and Scandinavians I am making somewhat of an electioneering speech. That is not so. I have come to this Parliament prepared to express my honest convictions, supremely indifferent as to whom I offend or whom I please. I know it is not the intention of the Government that any invidious distinction shall be raised between the European races, but I am also .aware that these people will take umbrage at the condition which this Bill imposes. If we are desirous of having the assistance of these people we should not prescribe such conditions. I have seen their homesteads cut out of the jungles and scrubs of Queensland, where scarce another man had the heart to go. They have converted these dense scrubs into smiling homesteads, and have redeemed a very large portion of the Australian continent that was practically useless. Besides being industrious, they are amongst outmost law-abiding, enterprising, and energetic citizens. Meet them where one will, settled upon the soil or in business, and one feels that in dealing with them he is dealing .for the most part with honest men. Loyal as they are to their native land, their loyalty in that respect has little influence upon their loyalty to Australia. I' have found them as loyal to the land of their adoption as to the land from which they came. I think that to pass a measure which will seem, even in a remote degree, to cast a slur upon these people who have so materially assisted to develop the resources of this continent would be a mistake. Let us declare in a straightforward fashion in the Bill that there are certain races which we do not want here. We know that there is a growing power in the East, namely, Japan. Are we afraid of offending Japan? Shall we put our fear of offending Japan above our desire to have a pure Australian race comprised of the best blood of Europe, which has made the British race what it is to-day % I hope that we are sufficiently courageous to crystallize our convictions into the laws which we place on the statute-book of the Commonwealth. I trust that in committee there will be material alterations made in this Bill. I wish it to be distinctly understood that my vote here is not so much with the Government as with their policy as enunciated during the recent election. If there be any departure from that policy my allegiance will be to the policy and not to the men responsible for it. My desire is to know that in whatever little part it may be my lot to play in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, I have given a vote to preserve Australia for all future time to the best races of the world and not to the servile races of Asia. The races of Asia may become better educated. But the intelligence which we see dawning in the East is a question of growth. The civilization to which we have attained has been the growth of ages. We cannot expect that in morality, in ideas of virtue, or in any other respect, a nation of yesterday is going to attain to the high degree of civilization which it has taken Europe centuries to reach. There is a good deal of sentiment in the talk about the brotherhood of man. It is a sentiment with which we all agree in the abstract. But I am one of those who believe that whilst we should do al] that we can to help those below us to a higher plane of living, civilization, comfort, and happiness, we should take all sorts of care that in our efforts to uplift them, they do not drag us down. When the Bill gets into committee, I shall vote for a white Australia, regardless of whether that vote goes to support or to defeat the Government. </para>

                            <para>- - But it is the alien that is the trouble. The kanaka is not the real danger. How would the honorable and learned member like to be nominated for a seat on the hospital committee - just as in a case which occurred at Thursday Island - and to be downed in the election by Japanese? That is the position. The Japanese are practically acquiring the ownership of the whole of northern Queensland. They are going on inch by inch, and retaining their hold, simply because the white man leaves it to them. Then the planters say that there is no white labour available. Why is that ? Simply because there is no labour for the white man to stop for. Therefore, there is the same old cry, " Go west, young man, go west;" and out west the young men go. The Japanese and other eastern races, however, are following them there. They have gone out west as storekeepers. One honorable member said he was very pleased to see that the interests represented by the honorable member for Wentworth were coming round to the cry for a white Australia. They are coming round because it is affecting their own pockets. These coloured aliens are entering into competition with them. They are opening up stores in towns in Western Queensland. They have their own merchants on the coast, and they deal exclusively with one another. That is why the interests referred to wish to see them done away with. I am anxious to do all that I can to get rid of these aliens and keep our race pure. Every man knows what happens when coloured races get in among us. They at once bring the white races down to their level, instead of rising to the level of the whites. Those who do raise themselves to the level of the whites get as cunning as foxes, and, notwithstanding our laws and our detective skill, they beat us at every turn. For that reason, if for no other, I would assist any one, no matter what his political opinions were, to rid Australia of the curse. What do we find as to their vile eastern diseases? Who brought the plague to Australia? Did it not come from the eastern countries ? And where did the leprosy come from ? If honorable members would only pay a visit to the Queensland lazarettes the opinion would no longer be expressed that the time is not opportune for dealing with this subject. I have seen a little boy who was going to school at Brisbane taken away from his parents and sent down to a lazarette. Do honorable members think that the mother and father of that boy had not the same feelings towards him as I have for mine, or as other honorable members have for their little ones? What would be the feelings of honorable members if such a thing happened to them? Let them picture the misery of it to themselves ; take it to their own breasts and see how they would feel. In South Brisbane there was a married man taken from his wife and family to a lazarette. He was put away, not for his own benefit, but to protect us. He was taken there to protect the rest of the populace. He' was ostracised, away from his wife and family, and from his home surroundings, for our benefit ; to keep us clean ! Who brought this disease to Australia ? The vile eastern races, which I am pleased to say the Barton Government is going to keep out. These are some of the evils that follow in the train of the Asiatic. There are many more. What do we find in regard to the docile Indian - the British subject - about whom some honorable members were screaming just now ? What good is the Indian ? He eats a bit of rice and robs the wife's hen roost. He will not eat meat killed for him by other people. He kills his own and does well.. He eats poultry while his fellow-worker has to live on corn-beef and damper. We all know what capital is. It wants the cheapest labour it can possibly get. During my election tour in Queensland I saw a contract called for clearing between Bundaberg and Gladstone, in the honorable member for Wide Bay's district. The price offered was so low that no white man would take it. The consequence was that a sparkling subadar went up with a new shipment of Hindoos - full-blooded bucks from Bombay - who took the contract at one-twentieth of the lowest rate for which a white man could do the work. That is another reason why we desire to get rid of these aliens. They not only enter into competition with the white worker, but with the white storekeeper, and it is because of that fact that we polled such a solid vote in Queensland for a white Australia. Every one knows the danger, but it is a most peculiar thing that some very "toffy" gentlemen voted for labour members.. If they had not done so the labour men would not have been here. We have only to analyze the voting in order to prove where the vote for a white Australia came from. Any man who expressed the opinion that coloured labour was good for anything went down. The whole of Queensland wants a white Australia. There is yet another phase of the question. In going through the lunatic asylums and benevolent institutions of Queensland I have been struck by the enormous number of alien inmates. Certain people brought these aliens here to do their dirty work and the general taxpayers are called upon to maintain them while they are in these institutions. That, again, is another reason why we should get rid of them. The lunatic and benevolent asylums as well as the hospitals are chock full of them. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and the gaols have a good many. I do not care how we get rid of these men, but the Government are going to have my firm support in making this country white. If some honorable members were to visit the sugar plantations quietly and take stock of the Japanese Javanese, and Chinese there they would have their eyes opened. They would find things very different to what they were when the people knew that they were going up there. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend who has just sat down - and I hope he will allow me to call him my friend in the truest sense - has a robust and direct manner which has secured for him the respect and admiration of the House, and we know that at all times he speaks with true sincerity and with very full information. He has done me the honour to challenge me to an undertaking which I trust we may be able to enter upon some day. The honorable member has made a direct, straightforward speech, in which he has strongly emphasized one point which impressed me on the occasion of my recent short visit to Queensland - that is, that the primary and the principal danger to be feared in connexion with alien immigration is to be looked for from the Japanese and Chinese and other similar races, and not from the kanaka. The latter may constitute a big danger, but it is a manageable danger. The other is a danger which is insidiously growing into the life of northern Queensland, and which will have to be dealt with cautiously, but drastically, and, I hope, thoroughly. I am one who appreciates, as I am perfectly sure every other honorable member appreciates, the magnitude of the consequences which underlie the operation of this measure should it become law. The possibility of complications is very great, and I sympathize entirely with the Government in the course they have proposed, although, as I interjected earlier in the day, I believe in straight-out issues, without subterfuge of any nature whatever, being placed in measures which come before us. I was therefore pleased to hear the words which fell from the acting leader of the Opposition, though they showed a somewhat novel departure in one who is usually so judicial in his utterances, and one who is fully aware of the difficulties which surround the situation, but if the Government will adhere to the educational test as the one which they believe to be the best under the circumstances, I for one shall support them in the endeavour to carry that principle through. </para>

                            <para>- We may imagine ourselves, and I hope we are, a great nation; but, considering bur enormous territory, we require a great many more millions of people here, before we can hope to effectively protect our coast-line. I have indicated that I appreciate the difficulties which face the Government in their desire to do what is reasonably right, and what they have justification for expecting the British Government will accept. I am the last to suggest that, so far as the internal management of our own affairs is concerned, we should ever place ourselves in such a position that we need hesitate as to our course of action. But when we come to great- national interests, and consider our association with the mother land, with Canada, South Africa, and other British possessions, surely we must not inflate ourselves with too large ideas of our own importance, without considering, however great we are to be, that we still depend, not only on the moral support, but on the material support of the mother country. Reference has been made to the health conditions under which people live in North Queensland. I made it my business when I was there, and by means of communications since, to ascertain what these conditions really are. I am informed that the health conditions above a certain line are such that children born there of parents who are engaged in ordinary work - and I think the honorable member for Maranoa will support me - are not anything like so strong as the children born in cooler latitudes. </para>

                            <para>- I have the evidence of medical men, and particularly of one medical man, who speaks with authority on the subject, and who is absolutely opposed to the introduction of this alien labour. His idea is that a race of Australians, if forced to do heavy work under the climatic conditions which prevail in Northern Queensland, will breed children who, in a large percentage of cases, will have ailments incidental to tropical regions ; and, further, that if there be a continuance of this work the third generation will not breed at all. I saw children suffering from anaemia and other illnesses incidental to such climates, and I take it - although I know the honorable member for Maranoa looks at this from a different point of view - that if the work these men have to do be increased the evil I have indicated will also be increased. This is a wide subject, and I only want to emphasize one point, which I will deal with at greater length probably when the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill is before us, namely, that the Pacific Islanders are a manageable quantity, and the lesser of two evils. While .desirous of seeing adopted the direct method suggested by the honorable member for Wentworth, I can understand that the difficulty would be great in passing such a measure into law, and my intention is to support the Government as the matter stands at present. The honorable member for Maranoa, who is always direct, and, I believe, is always just, made reference to the Hambleton plantation. A most honorable and skilled gentleman is in charge of that plantation, and to suggest that he or the company he represents, would wilfully lead visitors to suppose that there is a condition of things which does not in reality exist, is, I am sure the honorable* member will admit, most unfair. On the contrary, the conditions of labour and the arrangements at that mill are such that it would be impossible to re-adjust them simply because some visitors were coming. It would dislocate the whole of the company'sarrangements ; and I may here say that I made a personal examination in order to satisfy myself as to the conditions under which the kanakas there live. </para>

I did observe that there were Japanese engaged at that mill, who in my judgment were doing work which could have been effectively done without any detriment to their health by white men. There is a class of labour in that country which the white man cannot do if he is to sustain his fibre and strength, but. there is another class of work, however, which is performed by Japanese, Chinese, and Hindoos, and which I think ought to be done by white men. At the same time I do not admit that any alien can do work which the Britisher cannot do. At the present time I am engaged in the construction of smelting furnaces in that very district, and in the hottest part of that area, and that is work which white men may very well undertake. </para>

                            <para>- There may be something in that. I have always contended that every man ought to receive a proper reward for his services, and he ought to be employed under conditions which are not detrimental to his health. But there are conditions in Northern Queensland under which, if a white man does heavy work, he does irreparable harm not only to himself but to the race, because his children degenerate, so that in the third generation they will not reproduce at all. I realize the difficulty in which the Government find themselves, and trust that the House will see that, though the Bill may not represent the whole loaf,' it is a very substantial instalment. By all means let us accept it, and help the Government to deal with this very difficult question. </para>

                    <para>The speech of the honorable member for Maranoa, has convinced me that there is still room for great and heroic characters within the bounds of Australia. I sincerely hope that as he has been in the old country, and has been convinced by his experience here of the need there is for legislation of this character, he will be able to transmit to his descendants to all generations the importance of keeping Australia for the white people. I hope that no. attempt will be 14 a 2 made to make party capital out of this matter. There have been some indications in that direction. I am proud to see that all parts of the House seem to concur in the view that we should try to keep this continent, which is almost the only temperate part of the world that is available for settlement, exclusively for the white races. The Government are to be congratulated upon their promptitude in bringing forward this measure. Though I differ from them as to the particular means to be adopted for accomplishing our object, I must say that they have acted in a laudable manner in endeavouring to lessen the difficulties which confront the Home authorities in the settlement of this important question. The Home authorities have their difficulties. I am quite sure that no honorable member wishes to increase them. At the same time, looking ahead, I do think that we shall create more difficulties not only for ourselves, but for the Imperial authorities, if these undesirable immigrants once get a footing in large numbers within our bound? aries, than if we keep them without our boundaries. </para>

                            <para>- I will give the honorable member another instance then. The Marquis of Salisbury, who is the leader of the Conservative party in the House of Lords, has within the past three years assented to the principle which we are now trying to establish. I have here the debates which toot place in the Imperial Parliament in 1898. Of course no one will attempt to press the analogy to the extreme with regard to Lord John Russell and the Frenchman. But I wish to point out that the very principle we are asking for was affirmed by the House of Lords, although the Bill containing it was not proceeded with in the House of Commons owing to lack of time. On 23rd May, 1898, the Earl of Hardwicke brought in a Bill for the exclusion of undesirable aliens. It was carefully debated, and the Marquis of Salisbury spoke in favour of it. As usual, the Marquis of Salisbury gave as his reason I for doing so the narrow view that the unrestricted admission of aliens threw more burdens upon those who have to pay the rates. Of course he always looks after the ratepayer particularly. In the speech in which the Bill was introduced it was shown that in England undesirable aliens, such as Polish Jews, were increasing in number each year. The honorable member for Parramatta informs me that if they had in England the same proportion of aliens that we have here, they would have a million. I find, here, that when in 1898 they discovered that they were adding to the number of aliens in England they brought in this Bill to restrict immigration. Lord Hardwicke, in moving the second reading of the Bill, said - </para>

But that is not enough to meet the demands for rent and living. The standard of life also has to be lowered, and the newly-arrived alien is able to live in a way that no English working man or working woman would consider decent.

                            <para>- It is quite true there is nothing in the Bill as to an educational test, but there was no legislation based on that test until it was suggested by the Colonial-office to the Natal Government. I am sorry it was ever suggested by the Colonial-office. It does not reflect credit upon that office, or upon the Natal Government for adopting it, and I really felt it, very much against my grain, when the matter was discussed in the Victorian Parliament, to be a party to a piece of hypocrisy. As regards the suggestion that the method provided in the Bill prevents difficulties, it seems to me that instead of preventing it creates difficulties, it accentuates and intensifies the difficulties, because as has been said during the debate, the difficulties are a thousand times greater if we have the Japanese and other foreigners within our boundaries than when they are outside our boundaries. I do not like a good deal of the argument which has been used in tins matter with regard to morals. I hope we are not going to indulge in the hypocritical attitude of saying that we are more moral than the Chinese. From accounts received from those who know the Chinese in their own homes, there is no doubt that they are more moral than we are. I want to dissociate myself from the point of view of those who would make out that we are more righteous than our neighbours. The morality of the Chinese is great in their own associations and in their own homes, where they have the traditions of their race and their own families about them. But when they are shifted from their moorings, and come amongst a race different from their civilization, then comes the hotch-potch and the mixture. Have honorable members seen the vices of the mixed races as they appear in San Francisco? I have been through the dens of San Francisco, and of all the sights I have ever seen, I have never witnessed any more degrading or filthy than those. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing so bad. The best part of the city of San Francisco is taken up by the Chinese quarters. They have about 50,000 Chinese there, and it is the peculiar effect of the mixture of the two civilizations which we have to deplore and avoid. I am quite willing to admit that in their own associations the Chinese are as good as we are, but it is only as long as they stay there. It is when they come, not to bring family life with them, but when they come chiefly in large numbers of males into a country, where they seek gold by hook or by crook, that the dangers of contamination and evil are very great indeed. I shall not occupy the attention of honorable members very long, because in these second reading speeches, when I see that the House is really of one mind in regard to the main object, and that it is a mere question of detail as to the way in which the object is to be attained, I do not think there is any occasion for long speeches. I think this is a critical time, and we ought to act at once. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. If honorable members look at the geographical position of Australia, they will see that we are just near the centre of disturbance in the world. The principal bone of contention will be around about the east coast of China for many years to come, and we cannot afford to look on complacently. The fact is that the European powers are, for their own purposes, stirring up a beehive in China, and when that beehive is thoroughly stirred the bees will come out and we shall be stung. It is a very cheap and a very easy thing for the European nations to stir up matters on the east coast of Asia, because they will not feel the effects. But as soon as that great swarm of bees begin to move it will first of all move here, as this i3 the place of all others to which it is likely to come. Those Chinese who have come here have carried back with them the information that Australia is a good country, that they are able to get plenty of good land and to live in peace - as long as the larrikins will allow them- - and that they are able to carry on trade, and unless we put some restriction upon them they are bound to come here in very large numbers. It is not only in China, but also in India, that the people are beginning to acquire new notions. When was in India a few years ago I was told by one of the Rajahs that if they travelled over the dark waters they would, in the next transmigration of souls, become asses, and they did not want that to happen. However, I believe these ideas are gradually being broken down, and we have to fear an influx from all the eastern countries. I Want to prevent the Empire from being dragged into complications arising out of this coloured race question, and it is because of that that I desire to see steps taken speedily for the purpose of preventing these people from coming to our shores. The honorable member for Kooyong referred to the unsuitability of the climate in the northern part of Australia to the constitution of our white people. I understand that the honorable member thinks it will be impossible to develop the north of Australia, except by means of coloured labour. I think it always wise to treat one's opponent's arguments in their strongest and best light, and in a full and fair way; and I think there is the strongest evidence that, just as in India, we cannot expect children to be so healthy in the northern parts of Australia as if they were brought up in more temperate climates. I will assume that the northern Australia will be totally unfit for white men to settle in. That is, perhaps, going too far, but I would sooner see northern Australia unused and undeveloped for a generation or two than have it peopled with Asiatics. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so, but I say that even at the very worst, if it means that we are to leave that part of Australia undeveloped for a time, and confine our exertions to the development of the rest of the continent, that consequence should be faced with complacency for the present. The difficulty is to get rid of these people if we once allow them to obtain a footing on our shores. We have only to look at the great difficulty which is being experienced in America in connexion with the greatest racial trouble ever known in the history of the world, in order to take warning and guard ourselves against similar complications. I have not lost faith in the inventive powers of our race. I do not think we have come to the end of our inventiveness or resource, .and my experience is that when a want is felt, the inventive faculty is exercised to meet the difficulty. If there is gold to be won in northern Australia, or if there are desirable lands to be cultivated, no matter what the difficulties may be, they will be met by the resources of civilization, and the northern part of Australia will be developed in all good time. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to enter into a general discussion of this question, and my remarks will be brief. The honorable member for Maranoa was pleased to make a somewhat personal attack on me as being an enemy of a white Australia, but I beg to tell the honorable member that I am as warm a friend of a white Australia as any honorable member here. I regard a general discussion of this question as almost useless, because I am perfectly sure that there is no representative in this Chamber who would dare to rise up and express himself as opposed to the idea of a white Australia. The people of the Commonwealth have pronounced for a white Australia, and I am here to give my utmost support to the effort of the Government to attain that object. The whole question appears to me to be one of method, and I think the debate might very well be confined to the discussion of the best means of effecting our object. The Bill presents one method which, although it is very cumbersome, would arrive at the object of excluding coloured people from settling upon this continent. At the same time, it would exclude those of my Own countrymen who cannot talk English, but whose mother tongue Ls Gaelic. We are, however, told that it is not intended to have that effect, but that the only way in which we can achieve our purpose is by a roundabout course. The difficulty I have mentioned could be got over by requiring intending immigrants to write out a sentence of any European language instead of a sentence in English, and I hope the Government will consent to such an alteration. The other method suggested is the straightforward one proposed by the honorable member for Bland, which commends itself to my judgment; - so far as I may regard myself as free to follow the plan that I should prefer. The question is whether we are free to vote for the straightforward method proposed by the honorable member when we remember the speech made by the Prime Minister, in which he informed us in very plain terms that the method proposed by the Government was about the only possible way wo had of accomplishing the common purpose we have in view. If the Prime Minister will still state to the House that the method proposed by the Government is the only possible way, I shall be compelled to stand by the Government. </para>

One of the greatest difficulties I see is that the educational test alone is not likely to keep out the Japanese, who will very soon be able to meet in large numbers any test of the kind. </para>

But responsible Ministers, having carefully considered the best means of meeting the wishes of the people, have adopted this particular plan, clumsy, fraudulent, and absurd as it may be ; and if we cannot get the straightforward method of accomplishing the purpose, I, with great regret, shall be compelled to vote for the indirect method. It must be evident to the Government, however, that we prefer the direct and straightforward way of accomplishing the purpose, and the Government might yield to the sense of Parliament, and allow us to pass a measure of the kind, and chance its being rejected by the Imperial Government. But if the Government will assure me that they intend to stand to their proposals, as the only method of achieving the purpose, I shall feel myself bound to give them my support. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne suggested that we should adopt the straightforward 'course, and send the Bill for the Imperial acceptance. But after the plain declaration from the Prime Minister, with all his knowledge and confidential information, that would be to invite a refusal. Is the Commonwealth Parliament to go out of its way to create a crisis between us and the Imperial authorities? I have felt some difficulty about the matter, but in my humble judgment it appears to be my duty to do all I can to avoid a crisis with the Imperial authorities.' Certain members of the House, it would appear, would not be averse to inviting a crisis of the kind, and so wing distrust in connexion with the Imperial Government, but the Prime Minister having stated that this proposal is the only practical way, I feel it my duty to support the Government, although I regret that we should be forced to such a crooked course. </para>

                        <para>- I may not have an opportunity of speaking on this subject in this House for some time to come, but, like other members, I was returned here after expressing very warmly my opinions on this prominent question. I hope the Government will not hesitate about accepting the direct method of dealing with this matter. For a number of years I have had very strong feelings as to what I hope to see our Australian people, and I always have a strong feeling when I see our mother country becoming involved in wars with other countries. I do not know why there should be this great desire to invade and get possession of the lands of other countries when we have such vast territories in our own States, unoccupied and unused. I desire to see the Government of the Commonwealth, with all the force and power at their disposal, enforce the principle of keeping English-speaking possessions for English-speaking people, and encourage and allow every other nation to have their own land, laws, and rights. I have travelled about the world a good deal, and I have found that some of the most intelligent men, so far as languages are concerned, were probably Nubians, and native guides. I look on the educational test as a perfect farce. Australia might be populated with aliens if only that test were to be applied. The honorable member for Maranoa said that it was difficult, or impossible, for Australian workmen to compete with Japanese, because of the fine work, the system of living, and the wages of the latter. I go further than the honorable member, and would not only not allow aliens the opportunity of competing here, but if cheap labour is employed in producing goods manufactured in other countries and sent here, I would impose taxation so as to make them taxpayers in the country in which they are going to sell their wares, just as I would tax the producer in this country, who has to depend on the same market. There is growing up in our inland towns a system of Chinese storekeeping, and in Sydney, to a large extent, Italians have taken possession of all the fruit shops. We daily see Australian men giving way to these newcomers, and becoming, I regret to say, in many instances dependents on the State. I would like to see, as far as possible, Australia kept for the Australian and English-speaking race, and I would give similar rights to every other nation in regard to their lands. I like to see every class, every religion, every nationality growing up in its proper place, and each protecting its own rights and interests. I shall not live long enough, but those who come after me will see an Australian race, in the making of which a great deal will depend on this Parliament. I attach a great deal more importance to the alien who comes here as a resident to live with his wife and to bring up his family, than I do to the passing casual labourer. If we are to have an Australian people, we cannot allow a system of intermarriage with coloured foreign races ; and if I were the power that be, I would not hesitate to say that Australia should be kept for a white race. I would encourage trade between all the different countries. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care what it is called. Probably to some extent it may be a revenue tax, but at the same time it might encourage the employment of our own people. I do not want any taxes very high, and I have never said I did. But my feeling is more in regard to the question of race. I should like to see the Australian people constitute the noblest and ablest race upon this sphere. What the race is to be will depend to a large extent upon our system of education, upon the legislation that is enacted, and upon the provision made for the comfort and well-being of the people. I rejoice that during the period in which I have been in public life I have consistently voted for any legislation which I thought would raise the conditions of living for the masses of the people. I go still further, and advocate the exclusion from these shores of coloured aliens because their aspirations are impaired by traditional and hereditary bondage. There is no affinity between these people and Australians, and there never can exist between them any healthy intercourse. I think that our united efforts should be directed to preventing our territory from being encroached upon by a class with whom it is unwholesome to intermarry and undesirable to associate, and who can never be incorporated into our common life without vitiating that future national greatness which is the very foundation of every patriotic Australian's day dream. If the amendment is pressed, I shall vote for a direct method to exclude from our shores a race of people whose presence, I think, is injurious to the best interests of Australia. </para>

                        <para>-! thoroughly realize the difficulties of the Government in introducing a measure of this kind. At the same time I regret that they have adopted what I would style a backdoor method of accomplishing their desire. I much prefer the straight-out method of dealing with the difficulty presented to us. Of course, we are told that' the Home Government will not sanction direct legislation of this character. But I would point out that, within comparatively a few years, the educational test proposed in this Bill will have become an absolute farce. The honorable member for Wentworth told us that within a very short time the Japanese will be able to pass any test in the English language. </para>

                        <para>- I refuse to be intimidated by a reference to knowledge which we do not possess. We are here as a jury to deal with the evidence which is before us. In the Postal Bill we have inserted a provision prohibiting the employment of coloured labour upon our subsidized mail steamers. There is no absolute certainty that the Imperial Government will assent to that Bill whilst it contains such a provision. There is just as much likelihood that they will withhold the Royal assent from that measure as that they will refuse to sanction direct legislation for the exclusion of undesirable immigrants if it be placed in this Bill. Let us, therefore, adopt the heroic and straightforward method, and the method which is stripped of all cant. Let us tell the Home authorities that the Australian people are of one mind in regard to this matter. Then I am sure that our object will be accomplished. It will be a very serious thing if we are intimidated by the threat of what may happen, by reason of the action of the Imperial authorities, if we do that which we are sent here to accomplish. We ought not to begin our legislative career by inducing the Home Government to frustrate our ambition. If they do that once, and we make it easy for them to do it, they will do it a second time. If we have to fight this matter, let us fight it now, gracefully, kindly, and without seeking to create disturbance or to put difficulties in the way of the Imperial Government. Let us make it quite clear that what we say we mean, and what we mean we say. The Prime Minister has assured us that this is the only way of accomplishing our end. It is an indirect way, however, and I cannot for the life of me see why we should have this hypocrisy. We are told that the language test will really keep out undesirable aliens, and that it will serve the same purpose as the amendment which has been circulated with a view to keeping out all the aboriginal natives of Asia, Africa, and Polynesia. If it will accomplish that, then it will be known by the Home Government to have that effect. Why not, therefore, say in so many words what we intend to do ? Why this hypocrisy ? There is no reason why we should have to resort to that kind of cant in order to placate the Home Government. The means by which we achieve our object is immaterial. We want to accomplish our aim. If this circumlocutory process were the only way, then, as I desire to see these aliens excluded, I should be willing to accept it. I refuse to believe, however, that the Imperial Government will take the responsibility in the present position of affairs at home - and we do not want to take advantage of the present state of the old country - of frustrating the express wishes of the Australian people. That wish has been expressed in the first place on the hustings and now in Parliament, and if we make it perfectly clear that we desire to keep this Australia of ours free and uncontaminated, I am sure the Imperial Government will not offer any objection. Let us do this in the interests of the Empire, and then we shall make it clear that there is no offence meant. I rather like the language test. I believe the day is coming when the great federation of the world will be a federation of the English-speaking peoples, and this proposal might be a very good means of achieving that end, by making the language test the right of entry amongst us. I can see perfectly well, however, the futility of it. It will not keep out the undesirable aliens. It has been shown over and over again that the very worst class of men we have to fear are the educated aliens. We have to fear them because they are adventurous, enterprising men. They come amongst us, and they are not the least undesirable because they are educated. Some ten years, ago an African man named Nero arrived in Scotland. He was a professor of a university in Africa"; a splendid scholar, a linguist of the very first order. He made his way into the churches, and into the hearts and homes of the people of the place. Yet he was the greatest fraud imaginable. He outraged the good feelings of the whole society with which he was associated, and the Christian principles of those who had taken him to their bosoms. Still, he was an accomplished scholar and orator. The Prime Minister speaks about changing the standard, but we should want to get up early to create a standard which such a man could not reach. He was one of the most undesirable of men ; he had all the vices, the cunning and the treachery of the black-fellow of the lowest order. We do not object to these aliens because of their colour. We object to them because they are repugnant to us from our moral and social stand-points. Here let me deal with the moral standard. The intentions of the Government have been attacked from a very prominent Christian pulpit in this city. It has been said that their proposals savour rather of Paganism than of Christianity. I want to say, however, that our intention in regard to these alien races is perfectly honorable, and that we have no racial hatred or antipathy towards them. We wish them well ; we desire to do them good, but we do not believe that by allowing them to come among us we shall do anything to elevate them. It is just like that which very often happens. Some pure-minded, noble woman marries some degenerate debauchee, with the hope of reclaiming him ; but the almost inevitable result is that the man drags her down to his level. So with these inferior races. Even if we go back a considerable time before Christ we find that whenever an inferior race tried to blend with a superior race they dragged the latter down to their own level. There is a tendency in human nature to degenerate. The optimist would like to believe that goodness is stronger than evil, but history goes to show that where an inferior people blend with a superior race there is a general tendency to come down. The best course to adopt is to endeavour to induce them to assimilate with us by attraction. Let us set up a standard which is high. Let us remind them that our social and moral standard is to be kept high, and that when they are fit to enter into union with us we shall be glad to receive and welcome them. That is where the moral element come3 in. To associate with them is simply to come down to their level. It is not Christian morals any more than it is good socialism to believe that we can blend not to our own deterioration with these people. I wish the Government to see that we want to deal with this matter in the most frank and outspoken manner. We want to show that it is in the interests of imperial unity ; in the interests of the integrity of the British Empire itself, because, if we admit these mixed races, it will only lead - as it always has done - to complications. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; and the divergent interests will bring us into conflict with these people. To have any considerable number of Japanese or Chinese in our midst would lead very soon to complications with that very troubled part of the far east from which they come. We should point out, therefore, that it is in order to prevent any complication, or any conflict of interests, that we make this proposal. There is a nice and a nasty way of doing it, so far as our relations with the Imperial authorities are concerned. A nasty way would be to do it in defiance of the Home authorities. But there is another way of doing it. We may safely leave it to the head of the Government to find the proper terms in which to couch his despatch to the Colonial Secretary, and show him that the only way in which the people of Australia will allow this to be done is in a direct straightforward and unsophisticated manner. If we leave it to the Prime Minister to show that it is in the interests of the Empire, and to avoid complications with the far East that we do this, I am perfectly sure that his wisdom will prevail. I am sure he is with us, and that he intends to give us our ideals. We cannot talk over the Colonial Secretary to our side, but we can show him the sweet reasonableness of our demands in such a way that the Government will not refuse. He will at the same time be led to understand that the people of Australia are not the people who go in for circumlocution. If we once start the practice of going around corners then we shall always have to act in that way, and if we do it, it will be at the expense of our honesty and dignity. We are all one in end and aim, from the head of the Government to the leader of the Opposition. Seeing that is so, there is surely not likely to be any difference between us as to the means by which that end is to be achieved. Our motive is good, and it is only in regard to the means of carrying out the object that we differ at the present time. Let us lay our heads together and adopt the best system. As honesty is the best policy, so it will be found that a straightforward method is the best to adopt here. Seeing that the Prime Minister has not only this end in view, but has the cause so much at heart, I am perfectly certain that he will meet it. I am perfectly certain that it is the almost unanimous wish of the House, that we should proceed directly towards the goal we have in view ; that we should say that we desire to exclude all undesirable aliens in the interests of our moral and our social standard ; and in the interests of the Empire. There are many other arguments which could be used to indicate that this is the course which not only will meet with the approval of this House, but will be in accordance with the highest moral sentiments of the community. I could a tale unfold in regard to the state of the mixed population which exists in Melbourne. Melbourne by moonlight is a thing which will not bear mention. That fact is largely due to the Chinese. I could reveal the social and moral aspect of this mixed population here, but it cannot be revealed because it is too awful. The position is different in Queensland. There they see the evil in its most aggravated form, but in Melbourne it is quite serious enough although not as bad as in Queensland. There is something higher and greater than the making of money to be considered, and that is the character, the morals, and the health of our children. Let these people come in here and our race will become piebald in spite of our efforts to prevent it. Let us keep before us the noble ideal of a white Australia - a snow-white Australia if you will. Let it be pure and spotless. Let us try to raise the character of our own people, so that we may be a model to these aliens. Let us tell these foreign races that when they can live up to our social and moral ideals we shall welcome them; but never let us try to blend a superior with an inferior race. This is the end we have in view, and we venture to say that it is a logical one, which will commend itself to all the nations of the world. Let us go on directly and straightforwardly with it. I am sure that we may safely leave this matter to the Prime Minister, who is not restricted in his resources in any way. He will find a means of placating the Home Government, if necessary, and of showing them the sweet reasonableness of our demands. I am heart and soul in favour of the amendment, and I doubt very much whether the language test would secure the object which we have in view. Even if it would it is not so desirable as the direct, straightforward method advocated in the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- We shall goon with the Immigration Restriction Bill next Wednesday, after the Service and Execution of Process Bill and the Distillation Bill, which will also be proceeded with next week. We shall also deal with any further question that may arise on the Post and Telegraph Bill, but I hope there will be none. As to the Pacific Islanders Bill, the second reading will be moved either early next week or the week after. </para>

                        <para>- I would remind the House that this is not question time. Honorable members have an opportunity of putting what amount to questions in their speeches, but when the Prime Minister has gathered up their questions and replied to them no further remarks can be made by honorable members. </para>
