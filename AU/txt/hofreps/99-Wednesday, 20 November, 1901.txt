                        <para>- No ; they remain as they are. With regard to infants' and invalids' foods, included under the head of oilmen's stores in item 41, we propose to allow them to go duty free, unless otherwise specified, and the revenue will be a loser by the alteration to the extent of about£10,000. The intention is to remit the duty except as regards some particular items, to which we may refer in another part of the tariff ; but they will not be taxable under this division. Honorable members, on referring to item 103, " Timber," will see that "New Zealand pine, undressed, of sizes 12 inches x 6 inches (or its equivalent) or over " is amongst the special exemptions. That was intended to exempt from duty timber used for butter boxes, and the object was, as far as we possibly could, to secure the local manufacture of the boxes. We now find that the sizes specified raise a difficulty, and our intention is to so alter the exemption that butter-box timber may be admitted free for the purpose referred to, in pursuance of what honorable members know was undoubtedly our original intention. </para>

                        <para>- Our original intention was as indicated in the Tariff. We proposed to admit these timbers for the purpose I have stated, and our proposal is now to alter the exemption so as to make our original intention more clear. Of course, if it can be shown that we have timber of the proper quality, and in necessary quantities, suitable for making butter boxes, we shall be only too delighted to arrange accordingly ; but as far as enquiries go - and I have spared no trouble to get at the facts - I am not at all satisfied that we have any timber that can suitably supply the place of the New Zealand white pine for the purpose of making butter boxes, and the manufacture of these boxes within the Commonwealth is an object that we should do all we can to encourage. </para>

It was for that reason that I suggested the possible postponement of the cotton goods item, and for similar reasons I now refer to kerosene, tea, and rice. </para>

Further, we have had under consideration the propriety of transferring some items to division 6a - of removing them from the present dutiable lines, and providing for a bonus and for a duty in the event of an industry being established; but at present we are not able to indicate to the committee any certain proposal in these respects. Therefore, the sum of what we are stating to-day is this : We are putting the cotton and linen piece goods into one line; we are putting all apparel into one line ; invalids' and infants' food we have made free; the butter-box difficulty is met, and as regards three or four other items, which we consider should be very leniently treated, we propose to postpone their consideration until we reach the end of the Tariff. There are a number of items of a minor character which it would be inconvenient to refer to just now, and which will be mentioned and brought under the consideration of the committee in ample time to permit of their being dealt with when the main items are under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- Might I appeal to the honorable member who has taken objection to withdraw it on this occasion ? The course of allowing the leader of the Opposition to make ordinary comment on a statement made by Ministerial authority is to permit the views of a party as a whole to be expressed, and as long as our system of government is by party, there ought to be some latitude allowed to leaders in this respect. It would be too rigid an adherence to old-time precedents to say that whilst a representative of the Ministry is to be allowed to make a statement, no other party representative, equally interested in the carrying on of the business of the country, should be allowed the privilege of reply. I might mention that the Minister for Trade and Customs abandoned his claim to speak after the leader of the Opposition on the former occasion, conceiving as he does that, as a matter of parliamentary convenience, statements of this kind should be confined to the leaders of parties. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the honorable member for Kennedy will withdraw his objection. I have been a long time in Parliament, and I do not remember any occasion on which the courtesy now sought was refused to the leader of the Opposition. When a statement is made by a representative of the Government on any important subject, it has always been the custom, so far as I can remember, to allow the leader of the Opposition to say a few words in reply, and I think that the honorable member for Wentworth might have this privilege extended to him on this occasion. </para>

                        <para>- I can see that unless I withdraw my objection, an endless discussion will ensue upon points of order, and the whole afternoon will thus be wasted. Under the circumstances, therefore, I withdraw my objection, but seeing that we are establishing a practice that the leader of the Opposition, or whoever is acting for him, shall be in a position to reply to any Ministerial statement which may be made, I hope that Ministers in future will see fit to make those statements when they are moving the Speaker out of the Chair. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to claim the right to discuss the general question, but desire to draw attention to a matter of parliamentary practice and procedure in connexion with the proposed alterations. At the present time there is before the Committee of Ways and Means a definite proposal in the shape of a motion which has been moved by the Minister of Trade and Customs, covering the whole of the duties of customs and excise, which are to be collected. That motion, it is true, is still before the committee, and there has not, up to the present, been any general resolution for the protection of the revenue adopted in accordance with the usual parliamentary practice. I do not say that such a general resolution is absolutely necessary, but I wish to call attention to the fact that, in section 226 of the Customs Act, special provision is made to protect the Government against actions in respect of revenue which has been collected pursuant to propositions submitted in Committee of Ways and Means. The protection against actions contemplated by section 226 of the Customs Act applies only to any Tariff or Tariff alterations which have been proposed in Parliament. Under that section protection is given by the general resolution submitted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, because that has reference to a Tariff which has been proposed. No action can be brought to recover revenue duties collected under a proposed Tariff or any proposed alteration of a Tariff. But, since this motion has been submitted to the committee, two statements have been made of Ministerial intentions. I understand that, following the first statement which was made a few days ago as to the proposed alterations, new duties have been collected, and I apprehend that new duties will be to-morrow collected in accordance with the second Ministerial statement. I would point out that new duties collected merely in accordance with a Ministerial mandate or authority will not be protected under section 226. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it would be ruined, but at any rate it should not be molly-coddled. One of the difficulties to which the Victorian commission gave special attention was the question of compensation, and it no doubt will have to be faced if the idea of the honorable member for Tasmania is carried out. There is another matter to which I should like to refer. I understood the honorable member to say that if the duty upon tobacco were reduced to 3s. per lb. it would mean a reduction in the revenue. </para>

Otherwise, the committee would have to assume that the Treasurer is inconsistent, as by his estimate he shows that less revenue would be obtained from a duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. than from a duty of 3s. per lb. </para>

                    <para>- That would all depend upon ourselves. Lord Rosebery said of the liquor traffic that it would control England if England did not control it, and so it will be with monopolies. We have the power to control and should exercise it. With reference to the question of State monopoly it has been argued that having destroyed the value of the tobacco industry we should take it over. But that seems to be a very illogical and unreasonable view to take. If we are going to make the manufacture of tobacco a State monopoly, the more hands we can employ and the larger the profits we can make, and the more we can extend our operations, the better it will be for the community generally. With regard to the tobacco industry in England, I find by the last annual report of the Government Laboratory that the total consumption of tobacco in England was 83,561,083 lbs., and only 4 per cent. of this was imported. Therefore the tobacco manufacturing industry is essentially a local monopoly in England, and the manufacturers are growing rich whilst the wages of the operatives are by no means the highest or their conditions of work the best. If it is to the interest of the English people to foster this industry, surely it must be to the interest of the Australian people to foster the local manufacture of tobacco. In Canada the difference between the locally manufactured and the imported article in the matter of duty is not 9d., as suggested by the Government, but1s. 8d. per lb., and I have not heard any complaint from Canada as to the people interested in the industry growing rich or doing anything wrong. </para>

                        <para>- If my information is correct, the American tobacco which the honorable member appears to be so anxious to admit here is grown and made by the cheapest of labour, under conditions which are not regulated in the way they are here. I have yet to learn that there is any monopoly in the tobacco industry in Victoria. It is true that there are some firms who have done very well recently, but in previous years they lost very heavily, and it is only fair to take the profits over a number of years and strike an average. I have not heard of any combination amongst manufacturers to raise prices, or of any other united movement that would justify the talk we have heard about a tobacco monopoly within the Commonwealth. On the other hand, there are a large number of smaller manufacturers, in Victoria especially, who are making only a fair living, and who are employing only a few men. These men say that if we open the door to the imported article we shall not only injure their business, but throw a number of workmen out of employment. The honorable member for Parramatta laid great stress upon the loss of revenue that would result from the encouragement of the local industry, but he altogether lost sight of the fact that locally-manufactured tobacco is sold at considerably lower prices than the imported article. </para>

                    <para>- If the amendment, as has been contended, will have no operative force, or will not even assert a principle, it will, at any rate, act as a warning to the monopolist manufacturers, who are making thousands of pounds a year, that they will not be able, in the event of the industry being nationalized, to come to the Government for any compensation. The Opposition are in favour of the importer, and we are in favour of the workers, while the Treasurer wants revenue ; and the best way to get revenue is to provide that after due encouragement has been given to the growers and payment of proper wages has been made to the workers, all shall go into the Government's pocket. As has been pointed out, France, by reason of her monopoly in this industry, obtains an annual profit of £2,500,000, and Italy also reaps an enormous pecuniary advantage, so that this is a source of revenue which should not be neglected. The amendment makes it possible at some future time to take over the industry without payment of compensation, and I hope the honorable member for Tasmania will not withdraw it. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that we are asked to do one of two tilings. We are asked either to make the industry a State monopoly, under direct State control, or to allow the tobacco industry to continue in private hands, and to give to those engaged in it special preferences by means of a customs duty. That is the position which seems to be involved in the amendments submitted or foreshadowed. From inquiries I have made into the matter, and after listening particularly to the honorable member for Coolgardie, I believe that there is a good deal to be said in favour of this State monopoly as against giving special privileges to private individuals. I admit that within the Commonwealth, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, there are lands well adapted for the growth of leaf, equal to that which we are accustomed to import from America, and other countries, even for the purpose of local manufacture. One of the great difficulties that has hitherto stood in the way of developing the tobacco industry, has been want of knowledge, and want of care on the part of those engaged in it, and also the heavy excise duties imposed in several States for the purpose of revenue. If the industry were nationalized, it would be to the interest of the Government to collect a large amount of technical or special information as to the culture of tobacco leaf, and to bring about conditions that will lead to the proper scientific cultivation and initial treatment of the leaf for manufacturing purposes. In New South Wales some attention in that direction has already been given by the Government. </para>

                    <para>- If the honorable member for Tasmania, Mir. O'Malley, had placed a motion before honorable members definitely proposing the creation of a State monopoly in tobacco, it might have been worth our while to seriously discuss it ; but the amendment which he has moved is so meaningless that it appears to me questionable if it is in order. He wants the committee to say that " until a Federal Government monopoly is established," the duties upon tobacco shall be such as are set forth in the Tariff which we are now discussing. The committee are not asked to affirm the advisability of establishing a Government monopoly in tobacco ; indeed, the honorable member does not ask us to affirm anything. This is merely a cheap advertisement and nothing else. </para>

                        <para>- I know the honorable member for Tasmania so well that I acknowledge that I did wrong in accusing him of attempting to get a cheap advertisement, because every advertisement he gets he works hard for. If I have offended the honorable member I withdraw the expression. What I wish to emphasize is the uselessness of his amendment. If honorable gentlemen wished to delay the consideration of this Tariff, they could move similar amendments in regard to every item. We might move to insert the words " until a Government monopoly is established " before the proposed duties upon spirits, beer, iron, clothing, or anything else. Knowing a little about the amount of revenue obtained by other countries from State monopolies in opium and tobacco, it is extremely probable that if the honorable member moved a specific motion he would find me one of its sturdiest supporters ; but in view of the universal desire to proceed with the Tariff as speedily as possible I hope the honorable member will not insist upon his amendment. The question for the committee is really whether the proposed duty upon tobacco should be reduced, and the moving of amendments like this only diverts the attention of honorable members from the real point at issue. The whole commercial community are waiting for us to pass this Tariff, so that they may know what they will really have to pay, and we have no right to delay its consideration by incidental discussions upon practically irrelevant matters. </para>

                    <para>- I think the honorable member for Tasmania is being well advised by those honorable members who suggest that his amendment should be withdrawn. I understand that the Government have declared against the amendment, and the honorable member by pressing his proposal will be placing a large number of those who sympathize with him in his main desire in a very false position if he forces them to vote against him. He is making his proposal at the wrong time, because the schedule of the Tariff is not the place in which to air ideas with regard to the establishment of a State monopoly in tobacco. A large number of honorable members would support a proposal to establish such a monopoly if it were made at the proper time, but if the honorable member presses his amendment he will get a rebuff, and the vote on the subject will not fairly represent the feeling of the House. </para>

In this way work could be found for a much larger number of persons than are now engaged in manufacture. </para>

An examination of the evidence will show that the witnesses were almost unanimous in favour of the establishment of a State monopoly, as, in their opinion, it would furnish good results to the Government, to consumer and to growers. </para>

                        <para>- Primitive man did not smoke. Columbus, when he landed in America, did not .find the Indians smoking. Although tobacco caine from the State of Virginia to England, there was no smoking among the Indians ; the habit is the  result of civilization, and tobacco has become necessary through custom. Its use is now one of the vices of the people, and the profits accruing from it should go into the coffers of the State for the benefit of the general community. I admit that the history of the human race shows that every advance has been painful and slow. Everyman who stands up to advocate something new - something with which the people are not familiar - is regarded as a faddist, a fool, or an idiot, but a few years afterwards the  wise men of the community steal that faddist's ideas, and become great statesmen. It is said that the Government cannot manufacture tobacco, but I can show honorable members that the Government can secure the very best and most scientific men to take charge of their factories. They can also give better prices to the growers, who are now subject to the  will of the manufacturers' ring. The bonuses that have been paid to growers have been distributed among a number of Chinamen, who are engaged in the cultivation of the leaf, and I am told that a great quantity of the tobacco upon which the export bonus has been paid is now lying unused somewhere in Europe. The leaf used here mostly comes from America and the locally - grown leaf goes to waste. Under a system of State manufacture we should have uniform wages, and all the  workers in the factories would share in the  profits. They would share the profits which now go into the pockets of the manufacturers. We also intend if possible to take over the liquor business. . If we do this </para>

                    <para>- It is a matter for regret that the honorable member for Tasmania did not specify a date upon which this amendment, if carried, should become operative. If that had been done it would have been incumbent on the Government to carry out his proposal. But the  amendment, if carried in its present form, will have no effect whatever, inasmuch as it will not bind the Ministry. Had this matter been brought forward at a more opportune period it would have merited very serious attention. At the present time amongst all nations the question of whether the tobacco and liquor trades ought not to be brought under Government control is being seriously discussed. Certainly many advantages would flow from the adoption of such a course. In order to show that I am prepared to seriously consider a proposal of this kind when the proper time arrives, I intend to support the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I do not wish to give a silent vote upon this question. The honorable member for Tasmania, in submitting his amendment at the present stage, is not pushing the great principle which he advocates any "forrarder." To my mind the honorable member is really moving in the opposite direction. While I am willing to give him credit for sincerity, I am afraid he is establishing a somewhat awkward precedent as regards other honorable members who may not be so highly scrupulous as he is with regard to self advertisement - who may not be prepared to make those desperate endeavours at self effacement for which the honorable member is noted. We might be presented with the prospect of honorable members introducing a suggestion of this kind in all the various details of the Tariff ; and a contingency of that sort is one which even the honorable member would regard with a good deal of concern. I am thoroughly in favour of the principle of the amendment, but I object to the introduction of it into the Tariff. I hope, however, to have a very early opportunity of doing something in the direction of establishing it as an active principle in the social and industrial conditions of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The Treasurer recognises that, even with a duty of 3s. per lb., there has been a steady decline in the importation of manufactured tobacco, and, in my opinion, that decline will be accelerated if we increase the duty to 3s. 6d. per lb. What will happen will be that the consumption of locally manufactured tobacco, upon which the Treasurer will receive 9d. less per lb. than upon imported manufactured tobacco will be increased. The actual weight of tobacco imported into New South Wales was 924,707 lbs. in 1897; 929,034 lbs. in 1898 ; 859,567 lbs. in 1899 ; and 858,053 lbs. in 1900 ; a steady decline each year. The revenue from tobacco locally made from imported leaf was, in 1897, 683,928 lbs.; in 1898, 844,880 lbs.; in 1899, 949,988 lbs.; and in 1900, 1,181,668 lbs. I have no objection to the substitution of locally manufactured for imported manufactured tobacco, so long as it can be brought about without imposing a tax upon the people, but the fact that the locally manufactured tobacco is in New South Wales replacing the imported manufactured article, is an evidence that the manufacturers do not require a larger margin than 9d. per lb. There will, however, be an acceleration of this alteration if the import duty is increased to 3s. 6d., and the Treasurer has anticipated it. I do not wish to act unfairly towards existing industries, but when we have given them full consideration, I think we should not unnaturally reduce the revenue by increasing the import duty to an extreme rate.

I have already conceded that, after further consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the margin of 9d. is ample, though the fact that in New South Wales the manufacturers have been working with a margin of 9d. is not altogether a guide to us, because it must be remembered that they have had a good supply of locally grown leaf upon which they have paid no duty. </para>

                        <para>- In Victoria it has decreased very largely, because of the outbreak of disease, and also because we increased the excise duty from 6d. to 9d., and the extra 3d., it was stated by the growers, was deducted by the manufacturers from the price they paid for the leaf. The production of leaf is now increasing rapidly in Queensland, and they have discovered there a district which they have named Texas, where it will grow well. That leaf will be available to the manufacturers of all the States. It is also an undoubted fact that the importation of manufactured tobacco has been slowly decreasing. That decrease will undoubtedly continue, even if we reduce the duty to 3s. per lb., but we shall get more revenue during the next few years, if we leave it at 3s. 6d. per lb. Having given the matter full consideration, I cannot agree to the proposed reduction, because I believe it would play into the hands of the importers, and enable them to put large sums into their pockets. We are anxious not to press unduly upon the local manufacturers, and to encourage by every means in our power the local growers. No doubt as the production of leaf here increases, the importation of leaf, and possibly also of manufactured tobacco will decrease ; and when that happens we shall be able to slowly increase our excise duties, and thus keep our revenue up to about the same amount. The Government will resist any proposal to reduce the duty upon imported manufactured tobacco ; but we are prepared to concede 3d. by increasing the duty upon imported leaf. That arrangement will benefit the grower, and will also increase our revenue, because leaf will continue to be imported in large quantities for a number of years to come. None of us believe that we shall be able to supply all our requirements with locally-grown leaf, and, even if the quantity of locally-grown leaf were sufficient, I do not think its quality would be such that it could be used to the exclusion of imported leaf. We propose, therefore, to make the duty upon the imported leaf1s. 9d. per lb. That will reduce the protection afforded to the manufacturer, in so far as he uses imported leaf, by 3d. per lb., although the rate will not press unduly upon him, whereas if we increased the excise duty he would have to pay more, not only upon imported leaf but upon -locally-grown leaf, and the grower would suffer. By the course we propose, the grower will not suffer, and a larger quantity of leaf will probably be grown. I believe that the manufacturers will endeavour to use as much of the locally-grown leaf as they can get ; and if they are competing against each other our growers may get a fair price. </para>

                        <para>- That has been so in the past. No doubt while they have been fighting with regard to their tobaccos they have joined together in getting the leaf out of the growers as cheaply as possible, but I think with the larger margin there will possibly be competition amongst the manufacturers to get as much as they possibly can of the local leaf. We are growing very little leaf in Victoria, but if the manufacturers have to pay the full ls. 9d. on the imported leaf, they will probably make a big effort to buy local leaf in New South Wales and Queensland, and. the grower will get the advantage of the increased price resulting from the competition. I do not propose to speak at any great length. I think I have dealt fully with the new proposals. We are not dealing with cigars, but simply with the question of imported tobacco. The motion of the honorable member for North Sydney is to reduce the import duty on manufactured tobacco by 6d., but we cannot agree to that, and our alternative proposal, as far as leaf imported for making tobacco here is concerned, is to increase the duty by 3d., and thus reduce the preference which the local manufacturer has on imported leaf to 9d. We still leave him the benefit of the local leaf, and we think the effect of this will be to create a demand for that leaf, and thus encourage our growers to produce more, and enable them to get a better price. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know what the manufacturers will say to that. They will not use local leaf. Since 1888 there has been a considerable declension in the produce of local leaf in Victoria, and even with the help of the Government experts and the AgentGeneral's office in London, it has been found exceedingly difficult to place the Victorian leaf on the London market. In some cases they have failed to get any price at all. The local manufacturers believe that the only local leaf that they can really work up into a good article is that grown in Queensland, which is stated to be very nearly as good as the imported leaf. The Ministry have really disregarded the interests of the manufacturer, whom in other respects they have protected, and they are now endeavouring to give protection to the growers of the local leaf, the outcry in their favour being loudest in Victoria. There is no doubt that the consumer has not been considered in connexion with the proposed change of duties, because it is the import duty which fixes the price to the consumer. I do not say it is always proportionate to the import duty. I dare say the locally - manufactured tobacco is cheaper than the imported article, but there cannot be such a very great profit to the importers, if they do not reduce their prices so as to bring them down to the local rates. The idea that the importers are making huge profits is absolutely dispelled by the fact that the imported tobacco is said to be sold at a higher price than the locally-manufactured article. </para>

                        <para>- That is a very extraordinary statement, because we have previously heard that the importers are making huge profits, and that we must do what we can to cut them down. If they are making such large profits as has been represented they could easily have beaten the local manufacturers by reducing their prices, but the argument of Ministerial supporters that there is a big difference between the prices of locally-manufactured and imported tobacco entirely dismisses the presumption that the importer is mailing huge profits. No doubt the duty on imported tobacco fixes the local prices, but by refusing to accede to the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney the Government have disregarded the consumers and the pure question of revenue in order to secure the further protection of the local leaf. As a specimen of the class of arguments we are getting from the manufacturers who wish to keep up protection to the ls. per lb. provided for under the Tariff, I would refer honorable members to the statements contained in a circular which has been distributed among honorable members, and which is signed by Messrs. Wm. Cameron Brothers and Co. Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, and Dixson and Sons Limited, of Sydney. I have read and re-read the statements in these circulars - those in favour of my own views, and also those against them - in order to arrive at a fair result, but it seems to me that whether through ignorance or design - and I prefer to believe that it is through ignorance - honorable members are being deceived by statements of this sort being placed before them. It is stated that the average minimum price at which locally manufactured tobacco is sold throughout the Commonwealth is 2s. per lb., and that a fair average of the highest price would be 4s. per lb. The mean of these two extreme prices is given as 3s. 1 l-5d. Then, for the purpose of comparison, it is stated that the average price of imported American tobacco, under the Federal Tariff, is 5s. per lb., so that the saving to the consumer of' locally manufactured tobacco is ls. 10 4-5d. per lb. Honorable members will see at once that this is a most fallacious method of showing the alleged saving to the consumer. The framers of the circular have taken the two extreme rates in the one case, and have struck an average between them, whilst in the other case they have taken the maximum' average at 5s. per lb. They do not give the minimum rate for American tobacco, nor do they take the mean between the minimum and the maximum rates as in the other case. They represent that this saving of ls. 10 4-5d. per lb. represents a relief from taxation on the consumption of 1899 equal to £412,544. Of course the whole statement is fallacious and absurd on the face of it. Our real object should be to obtain the highest amount of revenue, to give the greatest benefit to the consumer, and to be as fair as possible to the manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- The statistics show that the use of the colonial leaf in Victoria has decreased from 406,351 lbs. in 1897 to 120,153 lbs. in 1900. In New South Wales the consumption of the local leaf has decreased from 1,188,808 lbs. in 1897 to 996,988 lbs. in 1900. So that there is no disguising the fact that the southern portion of New South Wales and Victoria do not grow tobacco leaf which is fit for use. </para>

                        <para>- I know some thing of the character of the soil and climate which are necessary for tobacco cultivation, and certainly they are not the soil and climate of Victoria. I am aware that on the borders of New South Wales tobacco cultivation has been moderately successful, whilst in Queensland it has been more successful. But the fact remains that with a protection of1s. per lb. the locally-grown tobacco has never been worth more than 4d. or 5d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to make a personal explanation. The honorable member who was addressing the Chair at the time I made the interjection which has just been referred to, stated that the importers were not making any money at all by reason of their importations. Thereupon I interjected, purely as a joke, "That is why they import tobacco - because they are insolvent." Any one in business would know that no importer could carry on operations unless he were solvent. I cannot allow the honorable member for South Australia to put upon such an innocent interjection the interpretation which he has been placing upon it. </para>

                        <para>- When the honorable member for Laanecoorie ventures to make such a joke again, he should preface his statement with the intimation that it is a joke. Certainly the joke in question was very hard to see. Many honorable members upon this side of the House did not take it as a joke. However, in future, we must not attach too much importance to the honorable member's interjections, which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as serious. The figures relating to the growth of the locally-grown leaf in New South Wales and Victoria, for a period of four years, conclusively prove either that the climate and the soil are not suitable for the production of the leaf, or that the curing of the leaf has not attained a high state of perfection. Considering that the leaf has been grown and encouraged in every possible way by the Governments of those States for at least fifteen years, it is abundantly clear either that they cannot grow the leaf or that they cannot cure it. </para>

                        <para>- Before the Tariff of 1893 was introduced, if the leaf had been worth anything at all, it surely ought to have been worth the duty upon the imported leaf. Yet the fact is that for a period of four years a steady decrease has taken place in the use of the locally-grown unmanufactured leaf as against the imported. This seems to resolve itself more into a question of the revenue, which I, for one, have been sent here to protect. I do not profess to be an absolutely rabid free-trader, and all my observations have been to the effect that the revenue must be protected, and the States secured, as far as possible, the amounts they were receiving before the advent of federation. Tobacco, wines, spirits, and similar commodities have been recognised by all free-traders as fair subjects for taxation ; and the only question is whether the manufacturers have not been receiving from the consumers of the </para>

When it is proposed to protect an industry of this kind to such a large extent, the Treasurer is entitled to see figures showing in what manner the industry has been conducted.

                    <para>- How many people, in' all, are there engaged in growing tobacco ? One honorable member, when I taxed him as to what he knew personally on the subject, said that he was aware of two men who were engaged in the industry. Chinamen are chiefly employed in the industry, both in New South Wales and in Victoria, though white men may be interested in the result of their labours, because in some instances they are working their land on the share system. It has been asserted that it is the competition of the negro labourer in the United States that we have to fear, but some figures which are taken from the eleventh annual report of the United States Commission of Labour for 1895 will show that that is not so. It must be remembered that in the northern States the negro labourer is not used, although those States' are growing tobacco in competition with the southern States. But where negro labour is used, I find that negresses receive 16s. 4d. per week, while the wages for female workers in Victoria are 16s. 7d. per week. The negro wages in the different branches of production average 33s.11d., 23s.11d., 20s., 19s., and 25s. per week. It has been stated that if the duty is reduced, and the margin made smaller, the factories will be closed ; but in South Australia they closed the factories the day after this Tariff was proposed, without the slightest justification. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the amendment for two reasons. In the first place, I find that, except in -Queensland, the import duty upon tobacco has been from 3s. to 2s. 9d. per lb., and, in the second place, because I know that the higher you make the duty, the smaller will be the quantity of tobacco imported and the amount of revenue obtained. The ordinary kinds of tobacco are used chiefly by the -working classes, wealthier people smoking cigars and higher-priced tobacco. As the use of tobacco is almost the only pleasure which a working man, especially those engaged in agricultural pursuits, can enjoy after his day's work, I think that we should make it as cheap as possible. The protectionists desire to see the duty kept on for the benefit of the manufacturer and of the producer. I have not been able -to obtain figures relating to the production of tobacco leaf in the Commonwealth, but the statistics of the manufacturing industry show that the total number of operatives engaged in the four States where tobacco is produced is only 2,080 - men and women. The tobacco produced in Victoria is utterly unfit for human consumption, and has failed to find a market in England, and yet some honorable members seem to be prepared to poison their own fellow creatures here by encouraging them to use it. I would ask the leader of the labour party to give us his opinion with regard to locally manufactured tobacco. I am sure he holds the same view of it that I do. </para>

                        <para>- It is a wonder that the honorable member is alive. Four of the States are, to a certain extent, interested in the growth and manufacture of tobacco, but two of them neither manufacture tobacco nor are they likely to do so. The Government proposal will strike a very serious blow at both Western Australia and Tasmania, because under the higher duties both States will suffer a loss of revenue which they can ill afford. I shall vote for the reduction of the import duty on manufactured tobacco to 3s. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think an increase of the excise duty would have that effect, but, on the other hand, the protection of ls. 6d. per lb. to the local grower ought to be quite sufficient. The Government have a good opportunity in connexion with the increase in the excise duty, to make a difference in favour of twist or strand tobacco, which is of very much better quality than is cake tobacco, in the manufacture of which short ends and all kinds of cheaper material are used. Twist tobacco can be made only from long leaf that can be manipulated by hand, and if the Government had made a difference in the excise duty in favour of twist tobacco it would have been to the advantage of the consumer and very much better for the men employed. It is worth our consideration whether we cannot secure for the men who work in tobacco factories some of the advantages to be derived from the encouragement of the industry in our midst. If it is not too late, I would ask the Treasurer to consider whether it would not be a great deal better to increase the excise on block tobacco by 3d. per1b., leaving the duty on twist tobacco as it stands. </para>

                    <para>-I used to regard my right honorable friend the Treasurer as one of the most candid and straightforward of men, but after having looked at the way in which he has arranged these tobacco duties, I think that he is much more cunning than I had previously supposed him to be. We cannot look at this question of the import duty on tobacco without considering the scheme of tobacco duties as a whole. In dealing with the import duty on the manufactured article we must also take into consideration the duty upon imported leaf and the excise on locally manufactured tobacco. The Treasurer has stated that under his new proposal there will be a difference of only 9d. in favour of the local manufacturer, and that if we agree to an import duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. on manufactured tobacco he will increase the rate on imported leaf by 3d. per lb., leaving the excise duty as it is ; thereby making a considerable concession from the free-trade point of view. Does not my honorable friend know very well, however, that when you once go beyond a certain point in taxing the imported manufactured article, every penny - no matter how you deal with other items - must give an enormous advantage to the local manufacturer ? Even supposing that the 3d. were not conceded, and that the difference were1s. in favour of the manufacturer with a 3s. import duty on the manufactured article, the arrangement would be much better and much fairer than with an import duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. and a smaller preference for the local manufacturer. I fail to see why we should not continue the average duty that has been levied in the different States in previous years. The honorable member who has just sat down has referred to the historic phrase, " revenue without destruction," and I would ask honorable members to look at this question in the light of securing " revenue without destruction." New South Wales levied a duty of 3s. per lb. on imported manufactured tobacco, and that State contains over a third of the total population of Australia. "Victoria, which has nearly another third of the total population of the Commonwealth, also levied a duty of 3s. Tasmania and Western Australia were likewise content with a 3s. duty, Queensland being the only State to go beyond that amount and fix the duty at 4s. - because, probably, the conditions in that State were more favorable to the production of tobacco, and it was desired to protect the growers. The duty which has been paid by the whole population of the Commonwealth, with the exception of about 600,000, has hitherto been 3s. per lb., and yet the Treasurer, who says he does not wish to create any more confusion than necessary in the finances of the States, and to raise revenue without destruction, refuses to adopt the rate which has almost universally prevailed. Now let us look at this question from a financial point of view.. The import duty on manufactured tobacco cannot be taken by itself, but we must consider the aggregation of the items in order to ascertain what the financial result will be. I find that in Victoria the total revenue derived from imported tobacco four years ago was £219,000, and this amount has since been increased to £235,000. In New South Wales the revenue derived four years ago was £289,000, but the amount has since increased to £323,000. Thus in Victoria there has been an increase of about £15,000, whilst in New South Wales the gain has been £30,000. In New South Wales, with a Tariff under which the manufactured article was placed at a disadvantage of 9d. as compared with the locally-manufactured article, the revenue result has been immensely better than in Victoria, but still we are asked to depart from a sound basis of finance and to increase the import duty in a way that will seriously affect the revenue. </para>

                    <para>- I know that there are several influences at work, but I believe that Victoria is not suited for the growth of tobacco. In New South Wales and Queensland - and especially in the latter State - all the conditions are favorable. Seeing that three of the largest States in the union - one in the tropics, one south, and the other in the middle - are specially interested in this matter, is it not fair to take an intermediate position, in view of all Australia, and have a moderate rate? There are many things which affect our conclusions. We find, for example, that in spite of Victoria having a difference of 1s. 3d. per lb. in favour of the local manufacturer, the industry from year to year has been a declining one. I am told, too, that so inferior is the leaf, that it is practically shipped to the other side of the world, so that it enters very little into the manufactured article here. I know, as a matter of fact, because I have had some dealings in it, that the bulk of the leaf grown in many parts of New South Wales - the parts, I suppose, which are least adapted to it - is, first, on account of the uncongenial soil, and, secondly, no doubt, on account of great ignorance in dealing with it, a very poor product indeed. On the principle in which I believe - that men should cultivate that which is natural to their hands, and should not be forced into other channels by any artificial action of Government - I say that the sooner the industry in those parts dies out the better. It is absurd to legislate in a Commonwealth Tariff as if we were dealing with the product of a certain State, which we could grow to advantage. The whole force of the argument, it seems to me, is in favour of a lower import duty. When we give 9d. per lb. preference to the local manufacturer upon an article which is so intrinsically cheap we do everything that is reasonable, even from a protectionist stand-point. But when in addition to that 9d. per lb. difference we increase the rate on the imported article, we add proportionately to the protection which has been given. We create practically by our higher import rate a prohibition. "Dp till the present no reason has been given why a 3s. rate, which has prevailed in a majority of the States and among a population of 3,200,000 as against a population of 600,000, should be altered now. Indeed, in many cases we find that an attempt is being made to maintain the highest rate that has obtained in any of the states. All through the object has been made purely from a protectionist point of view to create rates which are alien and inimical to revenue principles. Therefore I think we have reason, even on the principle enunciated by the Prime Minister of " revenue without destruction," to ask the committee to adopt the average rate which has obtained in a majority of the States. </para>

                        <para>- If we gain a shilling by substituting an imported lb. for a locally manufactured lb., the £80,000 would represent 1,600,000 lbs. weight of manufactured tobacco. This would be imported from abroad, and the price would go into the coffers of the foreigner, to the huge detriment of the local grower and manufacturer </para>

                        <para>-Into whose pockets do the profits of the manufacturer in Victoria go ? Into the pockets of foreigners for the most part, seeing that the trade is carried on by an American company, or a company largely in the hands of Americans. What is the meaning of the proposed increase of duty on manufactured tobacco? In every State but one of the Commonwealth the duty has been 3s. or less up to the present time, and the intention of the Government in increasing the duty is avowedly to decrease importation, and to substitute the consumption of locally made tobacco. From such a course the revenue must suffer, especially the revenue of Tasmania, and the consumers must suffer also. We ought to consider the consumers in this conjunction, and surely it is not for us, merely for the sake of bolstering up an industry in Victoria, to make dearer by 6d. per lb. the tobacco used by the working classes. I hope the committee will, by a majority, decide against the Government proposal, and that the opinion of the Minister for Trade and Customs will not find any weight here. I hope that the committee, in justice to the revenue of the different States, and in justice to the large body of consumers, will insist on the duty remaining at 3s. </para>

It would be unfair, seeing that the proposal of the Government in regard to excise and the import duty on leaf involves an increase in the cost to the consumers of the locally-made article by at least 3d., and in some cases 6d. per lb.-- </para>

                        <para>- The Government proposal, so far as excise and the import duty on leaf are concerned, already, without any alteration, involves the increase in cost that I have mentioned, and any alteration suggested by some honorable members in the direction of extra excise or increased duties on the manufactured leaf would mean a further increased cost of the locally-made article to the consumer. If, in conjunction with the Government excise and leaf proposal, we carry the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney, it will mean that the consumer of the locally-made article will be compelled to pay considerably extra for his tobacco, while the consumer of the undoubtedly better quality tobacco imported from abroad will be allowed to go free of extra impost because of the Commonwealth Tariff. As one who, generally speaking, smokes American tobacco, I do not see why I should not be asked to make some little sacrifice on account of the revenue required by the Commonwealth. But, comparing the position of affairs with that before the Commonwealth came into existence, such smokers would, under the proposals of the honorable member for North Sydney, be called upon to bear no share of this burden. </para>

                        <para>- The trouble has been that very few growers could supply the demand, and when the prices were up a large number of farmers rushed into the business and over-supplied the market, with the result that the manufacturers were able to fix their own prices, and now, no matter what protection we give to the grower, the manufacturers will still be able to control the price, because the business of manufacturing is in the hands of a few individuals, and is likely to continue so. We have, therefore, to choose between bleeding the consumers and taking over, the control of the business by the State, as suggested by the honorable . member for Tasmania, though it is not in order to discuss that subject at the present time. I think that ls. 6d. per lb. is the maximum duty for imported leaf, and that, in view of the revenue necessities of the Commonwealth, the duty upon the imported article should be increased to 3s. 3d. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- I stated that there was likely to be an improvement in the tobacco produced in Australia in the future, because there would be a greater demand for it on the part of the manufacturer, since he will not have to pay duty upon locally-grown leaf. But, in the past, a great deal of the tobacco produced has been rubbish, because the curing and preparation of the leaf, and often the soil selected, have not been what they should be. The Government have been paying bonuses upon tobacco exported from this State. </para>

                        <para>- Then where is the evidence of its quality? The New South Wales Government, as the growers were getting such low prices locally, shipped tons of tobacco to London to test the market, but the price obtained ranged from 2d. to 3d. and 4d. per lb. ; and it was considered that the quality was such that it was hardly worth while to use it. I think, therefore, that it is unfair to say that the manufacturers here refused to pay a fair price for the tobacco they use. When the Minister, and those who support him, tell us that the local grower cannot compete with imported tobacco under the protection of a duty of ls. per lb., which is equal to the value of the tobacco, he insults our producers. I have too strong a faith in the Australian soil and climate to accept that position. With that protection there is no reason why the Australian grower should not produce sufficient tobacco for the consumption of the people of the Commonwealth. The Minister has said that the Commonwealth will lose so much revenue by reducing the import duty upon manufactured tobacco to 3s. per lb., and, to discover what the loss will be, he adopts the easy arithmetical process of subtracting one-seventh from the revenue estimated to be obtained from a duty of 3s. 6d. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it would be ; but the Treasurer has shown that he does not think as much tobacco will be imported under a duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. as under a duty of 3s. per lb., a fact which should be evident to all. Then, is there anything to prevent an adjustment, as by increasing the excise duty while leaving a margin of 9d. per lb? I would ask if there is anything to prevent an adjustment of that sort which would still leave a large margin to the grower, and which would yield a large revenue in the future as the consumption of the local leaf increased. The arguments of the Minister for Trade and Customs were not on a very sound basis, and as for his attack on this side of the House, because of its reflections upon the soil and climate of Australia, I would only say that the reflections are his own, because he has made it clear that local growers cannot compete with the imported leaf, even when they have the benefit of very heavy protective duties. </para>

                    <para>I am persuaded, from a short residence in the colony of Victoria, after having visited the districts where most of the tobacco is now being cultivated, and others where it is cultivated to a moderate extent, that if the same intelligence and care are used here in the management of this difficult and profitable crop as are used by the average grower in the southern States of America, the product will be much improved, and the colony be successful in producing all of the pipe and much of the cigar leaf required for its own consumption. This is not all. With such a favourable soil and climate, if this industry is carried to the extent that is justifiable, in my judgment, by those who are interested in the agricultural success of the colony as land-owners, before many years the tobacco from Victoria should occupy a place in the markets of London and Liverpool as a successful competitor of the tobacco from Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, and other southern States of America, that is so eagerly sought after and readily sold on those markets. </para>

                        <para>- That is the only disturbing factor in my mind. Although he told us that he was going to levy an additional 3d. per lb., he did not tell the committee what increased amount of revenue he expected to derive as a result. There is no difference of opinion practically as regards the principle at stake. There is a conflict of opinion only as to the gain or loss to the revenue, and that matter ought to be speedily settled, seeing that all agree as to the principle involved. </para>

                    <para>One result of the new conditions is an immediate rise of 6d. per lb. in the wholesale price of all high-grade tobaccoes, whether imported or locally made. The Minister for Trade and Customs became very indignant because of certain, references made by the honorable member for Wentworth to the extent of tobacco cultivation in Australia. But the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who, I suppose, voices the opinions of protectionists in this House, talked to-day as if the tobacco industry were the great industry of Australia, and referred seemingly to the primary industries, which members of the Opposition desire to foster. He seems to think that agriculture, the pastoral industry, the mining industry, and others, which produce no less than £83,000,000 of wealth for Australia are quite minor matters compared with the importance of a few factories at Footscray or Williamstown. There was no indignation on the part of the Minister for Trade and Customs when the honorable member for Melbourne Ports made observations of that character, while there was quite a storm when the honorable member for Wentworth objected to these duties on the ground that they were revenue destroying. </para>

                    <para>- I have no desire to delay the division, but in view of statements made by several honorable members I cannot allow the debate to close without expressing my opinion in regard to one or two aspects of the case. The Minister for Trade and Customs on Friday last was good enough to read a quotation showing the decline of the tobacco industry in New South Wales, but was careful to avoid making similar reference to the industry in Victoria. About twelve years ago, there were about 300 people employed in the growing of tobacco in Victoria, and in this connexion, I should like to quote the following leading article from a newspaper published in the district of Wangaratta, on November 6 : - </para>

                    <para>Wangaratta is now the only tobacco-leaf centre in the State. During the last five years the Government has given a helping hand to the grower. It provided an experimental farm for object lessons ; an expert from the United States to teach how best to grow and cure the leaf ; gave a bonus of 3d. on all exported leaf that passed the expert ; rented in Wangaratta, at £100 per year, a Stemmery where the leaf could be graded and stemmed and packed for export. What has been the result? There are fewer growers of leaf now than when the Government came to the relief of the industry. </para>

                        <para>- I have a further list of the names of some of the people who received this bonus, and, at a time when we are so largely concerned in keeping aliens from competing with our own people, we find amongst those " Ah Sing," "Ah Quin," "Sam Soon," and others which are most difficult to pronounce, and which do not seem to be Australian. I am told that this export bonus of 3d. per lb. - which is more than the worth of the tobacco delivered at the port of Melbourne - while presumably paid to European growers, has, in fact, been paid largely to Chinamen. We were told that the people whose names were mentioned were the growers of the tobacco; but now we find that, although they may have been the owners of the land, most of the tobacco was grown by Chinamen. An industry which cannot succeed except by paying the low rate of wages which the Chinamen are willing to accept should not receive encouragement. </para>

The people have hitherto been paying 3s. per lb. upon their tobacco, and they are asked to pay more. The Ministry seem to think that the working man has no sense of taste or smell, and that the worse the article given to him the better he likes it. In increasing the duty the Treasurer is not consulting the interests of States like Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia, because he himself recognises that less revenue will be raised by the increased duty. </para>

In America such action has put thousands of pounds into the pockets of senators, and it is fortunate for this Government that there are no trusts here, or a similar suspicion might be excited against them. Their action has laid the whole House open to a most disagreeable suspicion. </para>

                        <para>- I did not say that the honorable member was interested in the tobacco industry. I say that it is a bad thing for the Government to put forward tentative proposals. As far as they are personally concerned, I know that no suspicion should attach to their action, but I ask them in their future conduct to guard against the possibility of such suspicion. It surely cannot be thought that the public will not look at this matter from all points of view, or that the workers will not want to know why they are being taxed to the extent of an extra 6d. per lb., when they know that the additional duty will operate very largely to the advantage of three or four large manufacturers. I think the Government have done extremely wrong in exposing themselves and other honorable members to the suggestion of having acted from interested motives. I have made my . protest, and as far as I am concerned, I think that not only will the revenue suffer through the imposition of the higher duty, but that undue preference will be given to a certain class of manufacturers. I intend to vote for the amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to point out that, unless the tobacco is entered by the manufacturer for special purposes, there is no exemption whatever. Surely there may be many articles in which unmanufactured tobacco can be used without any necessity existing for the imposition of such a high duty ? We do not know what the departmental by-laws are. I would further point out that nicotine is very valuable as a preservative against many fungoid growths. Under the circumstances, I do not see why we should be called upon to assent to so high a duty. The Ministry ought to show other purposes for which unmanufactured tobacco is to be admitted free. </para>

                        <para>- It may be very cheap, but it is very true. The proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth is that a duty of 6s. per lb. shall be imposed upon cigars, which is the rate that operated in a majority of the States prior to federation. To do this in face of the fact that the excise upon the leaf out of which cigars are manufactured has been raised 6d. per lb., and that the duty upon tobacco has been raised 3d. per lb., would be grossly unfair. We cannot get away from the position that the quality of cigars varies far more than does the quality of tobacco. Consequently there is much more reason for varying the duty upon cigars than there is for varying it upon tobacco. I agree that the variation in the quality of Australian-made cigars is much less than is the variation in in the quality of the imported article. If the duty were made 6s. per lb. all round there is no doubt that the man who purchased a 3d. as against a 6d. cigar would be paying far more in duty to the revenue. The Government expect to raise £116,000 from this duty. I do not know how much they would lose through a variation of the duty, but the amount would be considerable. If the lessening of taxation is to begin upon an article like cigars, I do not know where we shall arrive by the time we finish the Tariff. There are other articles upon which we can much more reasonably seek for remission . of duty than we can upon cigars. We shall be deliberately sacrificing our chances of relieving from taxation articles of universal consumption, if we reduce the duty upon cigars which are not used by a large proportion of the population. The amendment seems to have been proposed without a due consideration of facts which are within the knowledge of all honorable members. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that the Prime Minister has exactly interpreted what I said, and I think it is rather unusual to refer to a debate on a motion for the adjournment of the House. I simply said that I thought from the promises that had been made by the Government, we should have heard of some very drastic changes in the Tariff; that those changes would have been made on broad lines, which would have enabled us to deal with the Tariff on equally broad lines, but that as there were practically no changes made at all, as the Tariff was so very chaotic, and as it was impossible to take action of that kind, we should have to debate it item by item, and give it - unless the Government agree to reasonable concessions - our strenuous opposition all through. </para>
