                        <para>- I did not intend ray reply to convey that I would call upon Captain Creswell for a report, but that I would be very glad to receive one from him if he had anything to communicate. There seems to be a little difficulty about calling upon any officer for a report at the present time. We already have the views of His Excellency the Admiral, and if anything further is to be done, we had much better obtain a report from a committee than from an individual officer. At the same time I shall be very glad to receive the views of any officers of the naval forces if they desire to communicate them. </para>

                    <para>- I suggested myself in the earlier stages of this debate that 200 tons of grapes should be fixed as the minimum, but since then I have received suggestions that the minimum ought to be reduced to 100 tons. I have also been informed that what are known as wineries do not always buy grapes, but in some instances purchase the wine or must which the vignerons themselves express. If it is reasonable to grant a licence to wineries that buy grapes, it will be equally fair to grant licences to those wineries by which the product of the grapes is purchased. I, therefore, suggest that the definition should read - "Winery" means an establishment where annually 100 tons of grapes are purchased and treated for making wine, or where 4,000 gallons of wine or must are purchased for treatment. </para>

                    <para>- I should like the Minister to consider whether even 100 tons would not be too much in some cases. Where a new district has been planted with vines, and the people cannot afford to erect vignerons' stills themselves, they may desire to have a winery between them, because at the initiatory stage they have only a small quantity of either must or grapes to deal with. The Minister would do well to define a winery as an establishment where wine is made from grapes or must, and which is proclaimed as such. The proclamation would be sufficient, because it would be in the hands of the Minister to prevent undue advantage being taken of the clause. </para>

I fancy there is some misunderstanding as to the terms on which the Government deal with vignerons' stills. During the debate I heard it suggested that the time of the officers was in some degree paid for by the parties concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The report goes on to say that when an officer is engaged in supervising the fortification of wine with spirits belonging to the vigneron, no charge is made, but to check the increase of stills in Victoria, the late Commissioner of Trade and Customs - and there has been no alteration made since the 1st .January, 1 901 - allowed vignerons who have no stills to obtain spirits free of duty - which I think is utterly illegal - to fortify their wine, and when an officer is employed, his expenses are paid by the vigneron at the rate of £1 a clay, and railway fares. So far as this Bill is concerned, not a penny is paid by distillers of one character or the other, or by vignerons for the attendance of officers in connexion with either the distillation of their own spirits, or the use of their spirits in fortifying. But when vignerons are permitted to get spirits free of duty elsewhere for fortifying their wines they are charged - I do not know by what authority - a certain fee. The cost of supervision in the whole of the States is £25,000 per annum, and that is a matter of considerable importance. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ;. and it is rather amusing that in connexion with tobacco, there is a charge of some description made. Why tobacco should be dealt with in one way, and spirits in another, is a little difficult to discover. This point, however, can be discussed on the Excise Bill, which will be introduced shortly. The cost of supervision in connexion with excise is - New South Wales £5,353, Victoria £6,479, Queensland £S, 141, South Australia £2,2 1 6, Tasmania £490, and Western Australia £1,2S9. Theses figures should induce us t» consider whether the system is right, and whether we should encourage the multiplication of small stills. I do not think there is any inclination on the part of the committee to give such encouragement, seeing the bad effect it has on the character of our wines and spirits, and how troublesome it is so far as the collection of revenue is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. The point raised by the honorable member for Bland can be easily met by other provisions in the Bill, giving power to combine to obtain a still. Further, spirit for fortifying purposes can be obtained from any locality where there is a distillery. If the minimum of grapes or must is fixed as high as 200 tons, even large companies may be debarred from taking advantage of the Bill because they merely approximate to the minimum, and are thus unable to obtain a licence for a still. </para>

                        <para>- In some localities it is considerably more than that, and in other localities considerably less ; the soil and climatic conditions have a very appreciable effect. I would suggest that if the minimum is reached by the purchase of grapes and wine there should be the opportunity to obtain a licence. In the Rutherglen district, where there are a considerable number of vineyards, ranging from 10 to 20 acres, the Winery Company might buy 150 tons of grapes and between 3,000 gallons and 4,000 gallons of wine, neither of which would be the minimum. As to the charge for the services of officers, I have it on unquestionable authority that where the owner of a vineyard-still licence has distilled spirit, that spirit is under the key of the Customs officer, and if the spirit is desired for fortifying purposes the officer has to be paid for supervising the operation, although no charge is made for the attendance of an officer during the process of distilling. No complaint has ever been made about the charge for the attendance of the officer during the process of fortification, because supervision must be exercised, and those who require it are willing to pay for it. </para>

                        <para>- understand that the proportion of wine that can be obtained from a ton of grapes is, roughly, 100 gallons. I think we might define a winery as an establishment where annually a certain quantity of wine is made either from grapes or must. That will meet the case whether people are dealing with wine or must, or both together. If we take power to prescribe a reduced quantity, we shall do the best we can to fix a fair thing. The proposal was 200 tons, and that means 20,000 gallons of wine. </para>

If we put a regulation upon the table, and it is not challenged and becomes law, the responsibility for it is, to some extent, shared by both Houses of Parliament. But if on the other hand, the Government take it upon themselves to exercise executive power by the issue of the necessary proclamation, they can, of course, be dealt with at once by this House. The slightest expression of opinion from this Chamber would have its constitutional effect. I rather like the idea of the proclamation, and its adoption would merely be in harmony with the spirit of the Bill, which is that the whole thing should be controlled by proclamation.

                    <para>- I think the Minister might agree to the principle which is sought to be affirmed, because the amendment appears to go in the right direction. It would aid the industry generally if some such provision were made, and would protect the wine-makers against injury by unscrupulous persons who for the sake of a small profit might be induced to put a lot of rubbish on the market. </para>

                    <para>- When this matter was before us previously I promised to obtain all the information upon the subject possible n the short time at my disposal, and I nave done so. I would remind honorable members that we have already provided that no spirit shall be used for the purpose of fortifying wines unless it is approved by the excise officer, and is of a certain strength, and the question is whether we ought to go any further, and say as regards the man who produces spirits from wine, "We will help you," and as regards the man who produces spirits from other materials, "We will prevent you from using your spirits for this purpose." In effect we should be protecting the wine-grower and injuring those who produce spirits other than grape spirit. The letter quoted by the honorable member for Echuca was written by a gentleman who no doubt knows what he is talking about, and the effect of what he says is that if we do what is now suggested, we shall preserve for the wine-makers and merchants a market for their "off" wines, and at the same time prevent some one else from having a market for spirit which, however pure it may be, is termed " rubbish." This question is largely one of health, and ought not to be dealt with by us, because it is a matter for the States to consider. We have done what we considered to be necessary, and I think that we have already gone far enough. Will any honorable member say that it is impossible to use other spirit - it may be spirit made from malt - for fortifying wines without injury ? </para>

                    <para>There has been mention made that spirits for fortifying purposes should be made from wine or lees of wine only. The reasons assigned why wine spirits only should be used for fortifying wines are - (.1) That the spirit so made will assimilate more readily with the wine. (2) That it will be the means of keeping up the price of wine fit only for distillation. (3) That the poor wines will not be put upon the market, if other means for their disposal are available, and one way is provided if wine spirit only is to be used for fortifying purposes. (4) That it is a kind of protection to the vigneron, as it debars other spirit being used. (5) That limiting the spirit to wine spirit will be no detriment to the smaller classes of vignerons, but large holders will feel the shoe pinch when wines cannot be obtained at a cheap rate for distilling. </para>

                        <para>- I forgot to answer the honorable member for Bland when he raised this question before. I confess that, after the Bill was originally drafted, I struck out a good many clauses, which I was satisfied trenched on the State preserves. There were one or two others I allowed to remain, but I did so almost in fear and trembling, believing they were very close on the balance ; but knowing there were such high constitutional and other authorities in the House, I felt that all objectionable provisions would be pointed out. When, as a matter of fact, these clauses passed without exception, I laid the " flattering unction to my soul," that the grounds of fear I had previously entertained were altogether unjustifiable. The collector of New South Wales says - </para>

I am reminded that I did not quote the opinion of the Western Australian collector, which is shortly expressed - with that judicial smack we all admire - in the words " I concur," written upon the opinion of the acting collector of Western Australia, who misinterpreted the point, and did not notice the emphasis on the word "only."

I presume all legislation is intended to protect the best interests of the people ; but the Minister goes further, and says that the amendment is intended to protect the wine-grower. In my opinion the amendment does the very reverse, because I believe a very large number of wine-growers would like to be allowed to use any kind of spirit. </para>

                        <para>- I know, from personal experience, that one of the largest growers requested permission from the Customs department to use some spirit made in a distillery ; but the permission was not granted. In my opinion we have to consider the protection of the consumer, not only in Australia, but in other parts of the world. This is not a fiscal matter at all, but one which affects the reputation and character of a product of Australia. We have at present a great deal to contend with in securing a market for our wines. It is admitted that the quality of Australian wines is such that at no distant date they will occupy a very high position in the regard of wine drinkers in every part of the globe. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Minister will weigh carefully the report of the experts who have dealt with this matter. If he does so, he will find that the weight of evidence is in favour of the fortification of wines by the addition of spirits distilled from grapes. The Minister says that the protection of the revenue should be the first consideration. But he has failed to demonstrate that any loss of revenue is likely to occur. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that by the use of spirit distilled from wine there is not the danger of that harshness being imparted to the wine winch results from the use of other spirits. To my mind there can be no reasonable objection urged to the amendment. It does not affect the fiscal issue in the slightest degree. The quotation which the Minister made from the collector of inland revenue is not questioned at all. It is admitted that we can get absolutely pure spirit, but we must have it of a very high strength. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know. I merely wish to point out that the manufacturers themselves know perfectly well what effect potato spirit will have upon their wines. But why should not pure potato spirit be used in the fortification of wines ? At 60 per cent, over proof one gets as near to purity as it is possible to get. Because the use of potato spirit imparts a certain amount of harshness to wine is this Parliament to say that the practice of using that spirit shall be discontinued? What is the reason advanced in support of such a proposal ? Simply that some growers who fortify their wines with grape spirit desire to have a monopoly. This is absolutely an attempt on the part of one class of producers to damage the wines of another set of producers in another State. It has not been shown by anybody that potato spirit is injurious in the form in which it is used. The honorable member for Laanecoorie said that certain whisky which is made on the Continent from potato spirit produces very bad effects. But I would point out that bad stuff can be made from most things. It is not our business to bar the use of certain material which is being used in the trade, and which has not been shown to have had any deleterious results. This State has complete power to say that wine which is fortified by potato spirit shall not be consumed in Victoria, and thus the health of Victorians will not suffer. Evidently 'Victorian potatoes produce very bad spirit. </para>

                    <para>- There is a passage in the Scriptures that refers to certain swine which were driven by spirits into the sea, and I am under the impression that the spirits in that case must have been potato spirits, or that the swine were suffering from the effects of eating potatoes. This is not really a question as to whether potato spirit shall be used for the fortification of wines, but as to whether any spirit other than that produced from grapes shall be employed. I have had some experience in connexion with an endeavour to foster the wine industry by placing our wines upon the London market, and I know that the great difficulty in connexion with Australian wines arises from their want of regular quai lity. Inasmuch as we have provided under the Victorian law that nothing but spirit distilled from grapes shall be used for wine fortification, I think it would be extremely unfair, after all the money we have spent in placing our wines before the British public, if it became known that Australian vignerons were permitted to use any other than grape spirit in the fortification of their wines. This is a very much more important matter than some honorable members seems to think, and I hope the Minister will see his way to agree to the Amendment. </para>

                    <para>- The first objection raised to this amendment - and to my astonishment it is approved by the Minister - is that the amendment would go beyond the j jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to discuss this point at any length, because I admit frankly that it is distinctly &lt;m arguable one ; but, if I were asked for an opinion off-hand, I should say that the clause itself falls within the same category as the amendment, and is of doubtful efficacy. If we are entitled to say what the alcoholic strength of the spirit shall be, we surely have a right to say what ingredients the spirits shall be made from, and there cannot be any objection raised against the amendment which could not be urged with equal force against the clause. The second objection to the amendment is that clause 57 already provides that no spirit shall be used for the fortification of wines unless it is approved by the officer, and is of a certain strength. I have a very high opinion of the Customs officers, but I do not regard them as such angelic beings as the Minister seems to think they are. Very often the Customs officers and the consuming public do not look at things from the same point of view, and I think that if we are going to make wine we should have it made and placed on the market in the very best possible way. I have been looking through the evidence given before the select committee of the House of Commons on British and foreign spirits, and I have found some interesting facts bearing upon the comparative merits of the different kinds of spirits. A witness who gave a great deal of evidence was D. P. Williams, a collector and surveyor, at Dundee, who had had 28 years' experience in the Customs department. At question 7 9 he is asked - </para>

The pure alcohol is almost impossible to get without some other ingredient - it is very difficult: even the German spirit is not pure alcohol : the strongest I have ever seen is. I think, a little over 70 over proof. I have seen 70 or 71 perhaps. Pure alcohol is 75. </para>

I have got the particulars here, and this is one of the paragraphs from the report - ''Hygienic Consideration. - The ill effects of all commercial brandies and alcohol are connected with (1) the origin of the alcohols, and (2) their degree of purity. Beaumetz and Audige place in order of increasing toxical power the following alcohols : - (1) - Alcohols and brandies from wine; (2) brandies from pears ; (3) brandies from apples and from grape residues ; (4) alcohols and brandies from grain ; (5) alcohols and brandies from beet-root and from beet-root molasses ; ((i) alcohols and brandies from potatoes." That is the order in which they give them according to their toxical properties. </para>

                    <para>- I think the discussion has departed a good deal from the real question at issue. The point is not whether potato spirit shall be used as against wine spirit, but whether wine spirit only should be used for the fortification of wine - however pure other spirits may be. It has been admitted that the fact that spirit is made from wine or grapes affords no security that it is pure spirit, and we all know that there are poisonous wines as well as wholesome ones. </para>

The honorable member for Melbourne stated that the great difficulty experienced in connexion with the Australian wine trade in England arose from the irregularity in the quality of the wine sent forward. That objection applies more to Victorian wines than to those from South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have it on the authority of an expert who was out here from England recently, that the most reliable wines are those produced in South Australia, where they maintain" a more regular quality than in the other States. There is no limitation in that State such as is to be found in this measure, and yet we do not find any difficulty arising there. It seems to me that the provision in clause 57 is limply sufficient to meet all cases, because the approval of the officer is made the first requirement in the case of .spirits to be used for fortification purposes, and this approval will only be granted under specific instructions issued by the principal officers of the Customs and Excise department. These instructions will doubtless prescribe that certain spirits of a deleterious character shall not be used for the purpose of fortifying wine. </para>

                        <para>- There are. provisions in the Bill for keelung wines pure, and all that the amendment seeks to attain is that the only spirit allowed shall be a particular spirit which may be no more pure than others. The amendment simply directs that producers of the grape shall not only have all the advantages I have spoken of, but shall also have the advantage of a provision that the spirit used for fortifying purposes shall be distilled from grapes only. The Amendment is not that the wine producers shall use only something that is pure, because purity is not secured by the provision that only grape spirit shall be used. Purity can only be secured, even if grape spirit exclusively be used, by inspection on the part of the Customs officer. </para>

                        <para>- Potatoes were discovered in Virginia only in the fourteenth or fifteenth century, and taken to Europe, but grapes were grown in the early ages of the world, and consequently it must have been grape spirit that got into those pigs. Then it seems to me that those honorable members who are in favour of grape spirit are trying to introduce the morals of a monastery into a parliamentary committee. I should like to know what we have to do with any kind of spirit so long as the spirit is pure? Potatoes are raised on the north-west coast of Tasmania, and are sent over here and turned into spirits. The farmers in Tasmania are just as much interested in having their product turned into spirits as is the grape-raiser of Victoria. The Minister is not here for the purpose of giving fid vantage to any one over another, but he has to stand, as it were, as an umpire between two prize-fighters, and see fair play. If the potato-raiser of Tasmania be placed on an equal footing with the grape-raiser of Victoria, I am satisfied. There seems to be nothing more in this matter than a conspiracy - not a practical conspiracy for destruction, but an impracticable conspiracy. I was amused when the honorable member for Laanecoorie worked himself up to such a terrible pitch of excitement, and it occurred to me that if the mere thought of spirit affected bini in that way, what on earth would the consumption of spirit do to him. It appears to me that there is an idea that the Customs should be a department for the regulation of the products of the community. </para>

There is no denying the fact that this is an attack on South Australian wines, and it is no use endeavouring to disguise that attack as anxiety for the public health. </para>

                    <para>- As lam neither a Victorian nor a South Australian, I hope that what I have to say will be regarded as concerned chiefly with the development of what promises to be an important industry in Australia in the future. Even in this Distillation Bill we have to consider matters of this kind, and if this clause, as has been indicated by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, deals with matters which concern the wine industry outside Customs interests, I do not see why -we cannot logically include the amendment of the honorable member for Echuca. The whole question seems to me to be simply what is the best spirit with which to fortify wines. This is not so much a question of purity, because we have been told, and I believe it is correct, that alcohol, so far as ordinary consumption is concerned, is never absolutely pure. I believe there is great point in the interjection of the honorable member for Robertson a few moments ago, that South Australian wines have acquired their reputation in the markets of the world largely because of the fact that they are natural wines, unfortified to any considerable extent. There can be little doubt that the product of the grape as distilled is the natural spirit with which to fortify wines. We have heard a great deal about the question of the purity of alcohol, but this argument of purity is about one of the most extraordinary I have heard in connexion with this subject. Every distilled product carries with it characteristics of the material from which it is made, and though we hear statements to the effect that an absolutely pure spirit is quite wholesome, the evidence of experts and of medical men is that the spirit which goes into consumption is never quite pure. We know that in some of the distilleries of this Commonwealth, spirit is extracted from various materials, and then coloured and flavoured to represent whisky, brandy, or rum, as the case may be. But will any honorable member seriously contend that these whiskies, brandies, or rums are the genuine article? Should any one go to Scotland and ask a Scotch distiller why he does not adopt the same simple method, he would say, without hesitation, that if lu* did so, he would spoil his whisky - that it would not be whisky at all. What the distiller of Scotch whisky tries to do is to get as many by-products as he can from his malt, in order to give the necessary superior qualities which Scotch whiskies possess. With regard to potato spirit, we have had incontrovertible evidence that it is unwholesome, on account of the materials from which it is distilled. If the grape spirit is naturally the substance with which to fortify our wines, I for one fail to see why we should not take the common-sense view, and adopt what seems to be the natural and wholesome course. </para>

It is quite true, as the Minister has said, that in Tasmania we are not interested in the question of distillation. From all I have been able to gather from the remarks made this morning, it appeal's to me it would be better to accept the amendment proposed, as being on the safer side. The degree of spirit which is to be used, is only 35 overproof, and between that and 75 overproof, which is pure alcohol, there is ample room for marked differences owing to the by-products from which the spirit has been distilled being present. All the evidence so far seems to be in favour of using wine spirit for the purpose of fortifying, and on the evidence before me, I must vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>Yes ; and I think it is just possible that the presence of these alkaloids, due to the use of bad materials, may account for some of the prejudice against so-called silent spirit ; that if silent spirit is obtained by using a decayed or putrifying maize, or rice, or potatoes, you have got a much greater likelihood of some of those alkaloids being present in it. </para>

                    <para>- The most striking feature in connexion with this discussion has been the extent of the knowledge exhibited by the temperance members of this House as to the constituents of wines, and the relative effects of different kinds of spirits. The facts that have been brought out by the honorable member for Laanecoorie and others as to the soul destroying elements contained in the liquors offered for public consumption leads one to wonder that there are any people left at all to elect members to this House. We have had presented to us all the materials necessary for a most powerful attack upon the liquor trade, and I hope that some of the information elicited will have a salutary effect upon the habits of the people. There seems to be a disposition in connexion with every machinery Rill which is brought forward to attempt to graft certain fads upon it, and it appears to me that the amendment now proposed has a very strong fiscal flavour. So far as we desire to protect the public health, I think we may safely rely upon the Minister to take all necessary precautions to insure that liquor of low and deleterious quality is not allowed to go into consumption. I am not much concerned as to whether one wine-maker receives assistance through being able to use silent spirit as against another who uses grape spirit, but 1 think that if we are to have a national beverage such as wine, we should have it placed before the people in as pure a form as possible, and without fortification to a greater extent than may be necessary. I believe that the process of artificially maturing wine, by means of adding spirit, is one which must have injurious effects upon the health of the people, and I hope the Minister will do everything he possibly can to protect them in this regard. </para>

I may say that I obtained this information as a Minister seeking reliable information from his officers, and without any endeavour to colour the reports. </para>

His amendment is not aimed against potato spirit only, but against every other spirit except that made from wine or grapes. I find that .439,117 gallons of spirits were produced, and the demand for spirits for the vigneron's business is limited. It is not intended to lay down the rule in regard to general distillers that wine spirit only shall be used ; and how much of this 439,117 gallons was wine spirit ? No more than 3,436 gallons. </para>

                        <para>- If I understood that this was a general scheme for the purpose of preventing the consumption of spirits, and that after having prohibited the use of spirits generally for the purpose of fortifying wine, we were going further, and intended to stop all consumption, I could understand the position. But to say that spirits made from barley malt, barley, wheat, maize, rye and molasses are fit for human, consumption, and, at the same time, are impure and improper for the purpose of fortifying wine, is to contend an absurdity. If such spirit is already used for general purposes under the law, how is it possible to suggest on the ground of public health that it must not be mixed with wine. It may be a matter of taste ; but the only point on which we have a right to legislate in the direction suggested, is on the ground of public health. It is not, however, a question of public health, as is shown by the general allowance of the consumption of such spirit, and to legislate in the limited sense proposed, is an unjustifiable course to which I hope the committee will not consent. </para>

But to provide that compensation shall be paid in every case in which an officer makes a mistake would be a most mischievous principle. It would hamper the execution of duties under every Act in which necessary powers are conferred upon officers. I have no doubt that the Government will be prepared to deal fairly with any cases in which an error has been committed, and under the circumstances, I ask the honorable member not to press the point. </para>

We know that in the health departments and universities the necessity exists for stills for testing purposes. Of course, these stills will be under supervision.

                    <para>- May I point out that no metallurgical plant is fully equipped unless it has such a still as that which the honorable member for Moira desires to see exempted from some of the obligations which this Bill justly attaches to stills intended for commercial purposes ? I, therefore, join in urging the Minister to give the amendment favorable consideration. </para>

                        <para>- That is all very well, but the honorable member ought to be just to all parties, and I would point out that he supported a proposal in another Bill under which we prohibited the importation of a certain article, whilst we allowed it to be manufactured within the Commonwealth. 1 admit that quite unnecessary restrictions are provided for in this measure, and these rules were carried the other night in their present form, because, having taken it upon ourselves to place certain restrictions upon local distillers, there was no reason why we should not go a little further and extend those restrictions in the interests of the public. In rule 58, the provision that bottles must be packed in cases before they are delivered is altogether unnecessary. We do not make any such provision in connexion with breweries, because it is a common thing to see baskets and crates filled with bottles being taken out of the breweries for delivery to the various customers, t does seem absurd that distillers should not be allowed the same liberty, instead of being compelled to go to all the trouble of packing bottles in straw or sawdust, and enclosing them in cases, and thus giving the persons to whom they are delivered the trouble of unpacking them. Then again it is required that every case must have printed on it the name of the distiller, or the name of the distillery, and the place where the spirits were distilled. </para>

When the Minister was asked why this rule was required, he said that it was necessary in order that the public might know the truth. We desire the public to know what they are getting, and only those who desire that the public should have an inferior article should support the amendment. I admit that we cannot make this provision apply to goods from outside, but we shall have an opportunity of subjecting them to similar conditions when the Tariff comes under consideration. If we do not succeed in applying the same conditions to the imported spirits, the Minister has power" tinder clause 80 to vary the rules laid down in the schedule, so as to insure that the local distiller shall not be placed at any disadvantage.  </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be better to postpone the consideration of the second reading of this Bill. I did not receive a copy of the measure until two or three minutes ago. Judging from the remarks of the Minister, the measure is an extensive one, and there may be principles involved in it. It would be only fair for honorable members to have an opportunity to see what the Bill contains, and also to address the House on the question. We have no desire in any way to obstruct business. </para>

                        <para>- Of course there is no objection to giving the House every information available on the subject. The honorable member's question is somewhat in the nature of a surprise ; I have not yet had time to consider the matter, and there was not much time for the Attorney-General to communicate with in reference to it this morning. The authority to deal with bounties has passed over to the Commonwealth. That control implies that the consent of the Federal authority is requisite to the payment of bounties by the States. The terms of the Constitution are such that the light of continuance of certain bounties is preserved. The matter of those bounties was brought under my notice, and the consent which was given was to the payment by the State of bounties which it seemed to me were lawfully required to be paid. 1 will look into the matter further, with the object of giving fuller information to the honorable member. </para>
