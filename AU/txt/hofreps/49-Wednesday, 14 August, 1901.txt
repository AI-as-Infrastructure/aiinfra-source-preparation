              <para>- I think it is necessary to briefly call attention to the present position of public business. At the rate of progress -which, we have made during the three months that we have been sitting, it is not likely that we shall pass this- session any of the- really important measures involving questions of high policy which the country reasonably expects from us. We have been sitting since the middle of May, and all that we have' done is to pass the Public Service Bill, the Customs Bill, and two or three smaller Bills-. </para>

              <para>- Yes; but. the actual business done is confined to the non-contentious machinery measures which I have mentioned. If the statement of the Government, that we are1 to adjourn about Christmas time, is correct, only four months of the session remain in which to deal with the Tariff the measures which have come from the' Senate, and a number of other measures which are on the business-paper. -Judging, by the experience1 of Tariff' discussions in the State Legislatures, it will take us at least seven or eight weeks to deal with the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that even the members of the Opposition can take exception to that suggestion. In the' method we are now following there" is no likelihood of dealing successfully with general matters of policy apart from the Tariff, and I therefore earnestly urge upon the Government to make a clear and definite statement of their intentions in regard to the business before the House, and to make a change in the conduct of business, so that we may concentrate our attention upon one subject at a time, and, if necessary, take further time for Government business. I am prepared to make any reasonable sacrifice in order to insure that being done, and I believe I shall be backed up in that by the majority of honorable members. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - No one can quarrel in any degree "with the motives which have actuated the honorable member who has brought forward the motion, and I welcome it, so long as we can dispose of it without spending very much time, as giving me an opportunity for making a statement on this subject. It has been impossible in the past for Ministers to bring forward the Bills which are under discussion and take them one by one, proceeding from the second reading into committee until the consideration of the Bill is completed. We are not dealing with one State only, but with six States, and the necessity for explanation is not confined to the limits of the place in which we are now residing or staying, but it extends to the whole limits of the Commonwealth. Now it follows from that that when a Bill is explained on the second reading there must be a reasonable adjournment to allow of the purport of that Bill being understood throughout the whole of the Commonwealth, and for that reason we have always followed the practice, which we have regarded as a matter of duty, of explaining the Bill on the second reading, and then allowing a reasonable period to elapse before further dealing with it. That is a proceeding which is inevitable, and which is inseparable from the matters with which we are dealing, which are of far wider and vaster concern than any of us have had to deal with heretofore. If, in regard to the matters of importance dealt with in some of the Bills that have been introduced, we had gone on with the second reading debate, and then straight into committee, we should, of course, have been tackled by the' whole of the press of Australia on account of the precipitancy with which we were dealing with subjects of such grave concern. It is necessary for us to pursue a procedure of this kind, as those who may succeed us in office - if I may venture to look so far ahead - will find out. That practice must be continued with regard to Bills, and I can make no promise to abandon it. '.there has, however, been something more said in respect to which the honorable member for Bland has, if I may be allowed to say so, more nearly touched the point - that is that there has been a necessity for making a change in the order of Government business. That is admitted. But why has it been so ? The very conditions under which the Government have been working have caused some of the Ministers to fall into ill-health, and have prevented them from going on with the Bills under their care in the order in which they have been introduced, and that very consideration which the honorable member kindly gives us, and which I readily acknowledge, must be invoked by any Government leader under such a condition of things. We cannot escape from these conditions unless we kill Ministers outright. Short of that, we must he prepared to put up with alterations in the order of business. We have heard complaints that Ministers are not always in the chamber, but I would point out that there is always a Minister in the chamber conducting the business before the House, and I am always in the room opposite the entrance. The necessity has fallen on me at various times of conducting two or three departments, and with the mornings only available for office work, it is totally impossible for me to do all that is required, even by working at night after the House has adjourned, which I have often done. It is essential that Ministers should be away from the chamber a good deal, but not from the precincts of the House, when, as far as their connexion with the business of the House is concerned, matters are proceeding smoothly and safely, and they can be summoned at any moment. More than that, matters often get into an even worse state. Yesterday I had to sanction the absence of the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer at the Custom-house, because the work of dealing with the Tariff is becoming so pressing that it cannot be accomplished in the mornings. Therefore, there is necessity for Ministers being absent from the chamber sometimes, and this necessity presses as much on my colleagues as on myself. I hope honorable members will understand what I have stated in dealing with what might otherwise appear to be lack of method in conducting Government business. Now, with regard to Friday sittings, I desire to say that instead of taking Friday altogether, it is my intention to ask the House not to sit on Friday for a week ' or two for the reason I have disclosed, that in connexion with the Tariff, with which the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs are now deeply engaged, it will be very shortly possible - I hope next week - for the Cabinet to enter into the close consideration of the subject. When that time arrives, the hours now available to Ministers out of the chamber will not be enough. After the Tariff is presented, I shall ask honorable members to resume sitting on Fridays, and give up the whole day to Government business, on the understanding that we will do our best to facilitate private members' business before the session closes. I think I shall have the concurrence of honorable members in that. There is now an opportunity for honorable members to forego the abstract discussion of some questions, so that more time may be given for the practical discussion of public business. Of course there is another point - namely, that this House contains a. large number of gentlemen who have had distinguished public careers, which they are rightly desirous of continuing. In the course of those careers they have been prominent members of their respective Legislatures, and it has been necessary for them as such members to speak at length. Therefore, it is only natural that they should desire to address themselves fully to the various questions which arise in this Chamber. Still, we can pass with each other a self-denying ordinance, and I hope that honorable members, however natural the course adopted in the past may have been, will agree with me in the policy of short speeches for the future in order that we may get through our business before Christmas. Honorable members will observe this : that unless necessity has arisen, Ministers have consistently refrained from speaking, or at any rate from speaking at length. Now as to the order of public business. To-day the Distillation Bill will be explained ; then we shall go on with the Post and Telegraph Bill. Afterwards the Defence Bill will be taken, then the Service and Execution of Process Bill, and the Immigration Restriction Bill will follow as soon as possible. I wish honorable members to distinctly understand that nothing I have said is for a moment to raise the inference that we do not intend, if possible, to carry out the whole of the programme on the business paper before Christmas. </para>

              <para>- I have not promised that, but that is , my intention. I would like to remind honorable members that this House met really on the 21st May, because we adjourned until that date, after the opening ceremony, and the debate on the Address in Reply occupied until the 11th June or later. Therefore there has been for the transaction of Government business only a period of two months, and if honorable members make a computation of the number of clauses that have been passed through this House they will see that instead of our business having proceeded slowly, rapid. progress has been made with the bodies of the Bills,and that the only complaint is that they have not yet been passed into law. </para>

              <para>- That is the honorable and learned member's opinion; but supposing that we think that the majority of the clauses in the Postal Bill should be passed into jaw, it will be for the House to decide to the contrary, if they differ from us. We have got through so much business in the two months that have been really available for Government business that when honorable members consider that before Christmas there will be nearly four and a half months, no -one need despair of doing more than twice as much business in the future as we have done in the past. If we do that, there is every prospect of completing the programme on this paper, or at any rate getting very far on towards the enactment of the whole of it. It is impossible, four months before the close of the session, to ask Ministers to define all the business they will go on with. Subsequent events alone can disclose the ability of the Government to go on with business, and very much will depend upon the co-operation of members in shortening the consideration of measures by addressing themselves only to those matters which they consider material. </para>

              <para>- On the 1st January this year this Commonwealth was founded, and on the 9th May Parliament assembled. It seems to me that what ought to have run through the whole policy of the Ministry was the idea of completing the Commonwealth union as soon as possible. That union depends upon the free commercial inter-relations of the whole of Australia,and it seems to one that the guiding principle that ought to have governed the Ministry was to allow as little business as possible to intrude itself before the Customs Bill and the Tariff, which would give substantial effect to Australian unity. Honorable members on this side of the House have been in this peculiar position : that although it may be perfectly right for each Minister to explain the Bill he had in hand, we have never known from week to week or from day to day exactly what business was to be proceeded with. We have had four or five first-class measures at their second-reading stage, and although some men may be endowed with very high faculties, I think I may appeal to the House to agree with me when I say that no honorable members can keep in their minds the special features of the three or f our measures upon which they may desire to speak during the second-reading debate. The discussion that has taken place this afternoon may have the effect of so ordering matters that we shall be able to carry on the business in a more convenient way, and under conditions which will enable honorable members to know what is to be gone on with. It seems to me that in regard to each Bill upon which the Minister has made his second reading speech, we ought to go on to the point of completion before we take up any other business, and when Parliament has passed the Customs Bill and other measures connected with the control of that department nothing ought to interfere with the introduction of the Tariff. I assume that it will not take very long f or the other Chamber to pass these measures, which are purely machinery Bills,and I think we ought to have a distinct pledge from the Government that the moment these Bills are passed by the Senate the Tariff will be introduced without further delay. There is no doubt that there is a tremendous feeling of unrest throughout the whole of Australia, because the people have been looking forward to the great relief that will be afforded when all restrictions throughout the borders of Australia tare done away with. This has been the one central idea of the Commonwealth agitation, and people have been looking forward to the time when we shall be one people socially and commercially throughout the continent. The Prime Minister has referred to the matter of Ministers not remaining on their benches during the debates, and I think that it will be well for the Government to consider whether, when Parliament is dealing with serious questions of legislation, the whole of the Ministers ought not to be in their places. </para>

              <para>- The front opposition bench has no responsibility in these matters. .But, whatever members are responsible in this House - and we are all responsible more -or less - there is an added responsibility on the part of Ministers of the Crown. Speaking, therefore, as a man who has been in public life for -some 3'ears, and with a due regard to those things which constitute its best aspects, I say that Ministers , ought to be in their 'places during the sitting of Parliament. I think, however, that these remarks will suffice to let Ministers- understand that we desire not to curtail them in their,privileges as to putting before us, according to their own wisdom, the measures -which should first be submitted, but to concentrate their efforts upon those .Bills which are absolutely essential, and to bring in the Tariff without any unnecessary delay. </para>

              <para>-I imagine that the acceptance -of the salary requires our attendance here. Further, it .requires in the case of Ministers the discharge of Ministerial work, and it seems to me that that Ministerial work is of more importance than that it should be put aside in order that we might sit -idly here. For honorable members to complain of our absence when such absence is caused by attention to Ministerial duties seems to me-to be assuming a right to complain, when no such right exists. It is suggested, I imagine, by the tone' of the 'honorable member for Wentworth, that Ministers are in some degree to blame that there has .been delay in dealing with certain matters, an absence of diligence, and that - work has been neglected. I claim to know as much about the preparation of the Tariff as any man, and I do -not hesitate to state, without the slightest fear of contradiction, that greater diligence could hardly have been exhibited by Ministers generally in the preparation of that Tariff for the consideration of this House. Let us .look at the nature of the task upon which they have been engaged. This is the first session of our national Parliament, and it is necessary therefore to -pass a variety of machinery Bills. Then there is the Tariff, which is one of the most .important matters with which we have to deal. But what is essential as a preliminary to the introduction and carrying of the Tariff? What is the good of .having uniform duties if we are collecting them under varying conditions in different States ? Why, it is declared within the four corners of the Constitution Act itself that upon the adoption of uniform duties .of customs and' excise, the State laws imposing those duties shall cease to operate. That means that when we have uniform duties the whole of the present machinery will be practically gone. It is necessary, therefore, to have something to take its place. We have been doing all we can to substitute that machinery. </para>

              <para>- The figures in the report show it. Unless the honorable member is prepared to combat those figures, it is made perfectly clear by the report that this " scourge " - as some people call it - is a declining factor just as is Chinese immigration. Whilst I am not prepared at present to combat the necessity of a measure of this kind, I do say that it is not necessary this year, because it is certainly not so important as are some of the Bills on the business paper. I think I can claim for my honorable friend, the member for Wentworth, and also for the leader of the party, that not the slightest obstruction to the Government, in their desire to get on with the business, has been shown by this side of the House. In fact, I think it would be possible to show that on one or two critical occasions the Opposition have done their best to make the course of the Government as easy as possible, because they considered that the questions involved were either matters of administration or matters upon which the sympathy of the whole House should be with the </para>

What I complain of, is that we are having a go-as-you-please programme. One never, knows what is coming up. Things are postponed for the convenience of Ministers.

What I would ask the Government to do, if I were in a position to speak personally, is to let us know, sooner or later, the order of importance of the measures in the Government programme. Let us have the indispensable ones disposed of first. Do not let us rely on the expectation of the Prime. Minister that we are ' going to get through, this programme in this session. I am perfectly certain- that we shall not, and so long as there is a difference of opinion upon the question it will be more becoming, and more in- the order of business, for the Government to put these measures' in, rotation, according to their importance; They should, let us know what we are- going to do. Those of. us who come from the other States at very great loss and inconvenience to ourselves, should know what we are going to be called upon to debate. We should not be expected to carry three or four second - reading speeches in our heads at the one time. If the Government will place the- measures in their order- of. importance, and . will* adhere to that rotation, it will conduce very much to the convenience of the House, and to the character- of the legislation that is passed. </para>

            <para>- I entirely agree with the contentions raised by the honorable .member for Bland. In vulgar' parlance, the Government have "bitten off more than they can chew." They have put a programme before- us which it is utterly impossible to get through this session; It would be much better if' the Government would only act ingenuously in this matter- and tell us that they recognise the fact that there are certain Bills - such as the Defence Bill, about which there is a great difference of opinion, and which must lead to protracted strife when we get into committee - which can stand over till they have got rid of more important measures. There is also the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and the Inter-State Commission Bill, in regard to both of which there is a variety of discordant opinions. It is utterly impossible to imagine that all these measures can be put through without a considerable amount of talk. In view of that fact, I think it- is plainly- the duty of the Government, if they are going to be as patriotic as they desire the Op1position to be, to intimate at once that some of these measures shall stand over,, anil that other more important Bills shall be taken in their place. No doubt the public idea was that the first session of Parliament should be given up to the consideration of the Customs Bill and then the Tariff. Even allowing that the preparation of a Tariff requires a great deal of- consideration, I think the Government have been wanting in energy in not putting it forward more rapidly. Their energy has been dissipated upon a number of matters which the country would willingly allow to stand over. </para>

            <para>- I think the Government will see that so far as the Opposition are concerned the responsibility for moving this adjournment rests with another- section of the House. The members of the Opposition have refrained absolutely from moving the adjournment of the House -during the present session, making the one allowance in regard to the motion put forward by my honorable friend the member for Illawarra, and which was moved in consequence of a masterly manoeuvre on the part of an honorable member on the Government benches; who submitted a motion in regard to bicycles on the previous day. With that one exception, the Opposition have not endeavoured to obstruct' the business of the Government during the whole session. I think that is a very fair' and honorable record for the Opposition to show; I wish; as far as I am concerned, to cultivate that friendly way of carrying on the politics of the- Commonwealth which' has hitherto prevailed in this House, and . which is not always so manifest; perhaps, in some other political bodies, in the Commonwealth. I was a little unused to it at first, coming, as I ' do, from the* stormy latitudes of .New South Wales, but I have tried to bring myself down to the tranquility and judicial atmosphere of this Chamber. T must frankly confess, that it is an attitude and an atmosphere to be preserved. I feel that in this new Parliament perhaps the very first lesson which we should wish to learn is that of fairness- to those who are opposed to us, and moderation in our criticisms. The Opposition have been able to show that disposition during the present Parliament. So far as I can see the Opposition can be very well satisfied with the progress made by the- Government in the wrong way while they are left to themselves. It is perhaps in that respect that we have not been tempted to interfere. We might be very well satisfied at the result of our abstinence from interference. Now that this matter has come UP, however; I think I might be allowed to make a few remarks. I should like to point out that the criticism which I understand to have been levelled at the Government by the honorable, member for Bland mainly referred to the fact that so much time has been taken up in this Parliament, in both Houses of this Parliament, with two subjects, the Post and Telegraph Bill, and the Defence Bill'. Of course we have not yet. seriously addressed ourselves to the Defence Bill, but it is perfectly evident that its consideration will occupy a considerable period of time in both Houses if it is proceeded with this session. I ventured long ago to express the opinion that, inasmuch as the Commonwealth was not forced to take over the Post and Telegraph department and the defences upon the inauguration of federation, that step might well have been delayed until comprehensive and well considered measures for dealing with the departments had been passed. The Government, however, thought it well to take another course, and that other course has thrown more important and pressing business into arrears. I think that the impatience of honorable members whose homes, and in some cases whose businesses, are at a distance from Melbourne -can well be sympathized with, even by honorable members opposite who have the good fortune to live in this city. I have heard that the Prime Minister stated to-day that the Cabinet hoped to address themselves closely to the Tariff within a week or two. I received that statement with profound amazement. I think the intelligence that a Cabinet which has been in existence for seven months, and whose members knew that the framing of a Tariff overshadowed in importance all other matters, and were aware of the multitude of difficult problems which . must be solved in connexion with it and the vast amount of inconvenience which must be suffered every day by reason of the uncertainty caused by delay, has not yet devoted itself to its close consideration, will be received throughout Australia with grave indignation. </para>

              <para>- The adjournment of the House has been moved four times altogether - twice by the leader of the labour party, once by a member of the Opposition, and once by a Government supporter - so that I think honours are equally divided. One honorable member stated that there were a number of unimportant measures on the business paper that might very well be left out, and that one of these was the Pacific Islands Labourers Bill. I desire to impress on the House the fact that Queensland has' spoken in the most emphatic way on this matter, and that not a solitary man who expressed himself in favour of black labour was able to secure a seat in the Senate. I admit that there are one or two representatives in this House who are in favour of black labour. I understand the honorable member for Oxley is one. </para>

            <para>- I understood the honorable member was, but now I must come to the conclusion that Queensland voted solidly against black labour so. far as both Federal Houses are concerned. The Government of Queensland, in conjunction with the society of which the Premier there was President, ran six candidates for the Senate in favor of black labour; and not one of them was able to obtain a seat. Further than that, the labour candidates who were opposed to it headed the poll by a majority of some thousands. Under these circumstances, it will be seen that Queensland regards the black labour question as a very vital and urgent one, which should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment. Just as in. the case of the Tariff, there is a strong desire throughout the States to have the matter settled as soon as possible, so, in regard to the sugar industry, even those who are in favour of employing kanakas wish that the matter of black labour should be decided as speedily as it can be, in order that the industry may be placed on a sound footing. It is stated that the financial institutions do not care to advance money to people engaged in. the sugar industry whilst the present state of uncertainty exists, and honorable members can therefore understand the importance of the matter. At the same time I think there are a number of measures on the business paper which should have been left out - such as the inter-State Commission Bill, the Judiciary Bill, the High Court Procedure Bill, and others, which might very well have been dealt with next session. I hope, however, that whatever is done, this Parliament will be prepared to sit until most of the legislation now on the programme has been passed. I sympathize with those honorable members who have to go back to their businesses, but I would point out that many of us have been compelled to relinquish our business altogether. We recently saw a statement in one of the newspapers that the Government desired that the House should be adjourned for a fortnight to enable them to consider the Tariff. </para>

              <para>- On being questioned in the House the Prime Minister disclaimed any intention of adjourning, but now he says that in the course of a fortnight he is going to ask the House to abandon Friday sittings so that the Government may deal with the Tariff. I was always opposed to making Friday a. private members' day, because I thought it resulted in a waste of time. I think if the Government allowed private members business to take precedence from, half -past 2 until half-past 6 on Fridays, and then sat on to take Government business in the evening, it would be a far preferable course to adopt. </para>

I were leader of an Opposition I would take care that the Ministry kept a quorum. If the Opposition were properly organized and always prepared to vote, the Ministry would be compelled to keep a large number of their supporters always on hand. I have always held that if an honorable member is not prepared to sacrifice his private business to his public duties he has no right to be here. </para>

              <para>- That, is no doubt one of the methods by which public business could be expedited. The discussion on the Defence Bill lasted for three weeks, and honorable members went on to the end of the debate as if they were the first speakers on the Bill, and. repeated what had been said over and over again. It has been urged against the Ministry that their Bills have required a great amount of recommittal, but that has been due to our standing orders, which prevent amendments being made on the third reading. The only reflection cast upon the Government by the mover o£ this motion was that the Government had been incomplete in its method of dealing; with public business. Certainly we have seen a little slackness, but that has not frequently occurred. It has- also been urged that Ministers are too often absent from the Treasury benches. It is always gratifying to the House to see the Treasury benches- well filled, but that is not always possible even in ordinary Legislatures and- in ordinary sessions. During- the* two months we- have been engaged in practical, legislation, an enormous amount of work has- been, put through this House,, and I do not think there is any special cause for complaint, especially when we consider that a good deal of time has been unnecessarily taken up in debating the same matter over and over again. I was astonished to hear the honorable- member for Wentworth, and. the honorable and learned member for Parkes, cast reflections upon Ministers owing to their frequent absence from the Treasury benches. The circumstances under which Ministers have to work are extraordinary, and if Ministers are in the chamber throughout our sittings, they cannot possibly get on with their departmental work. I think the honorable member for Bland has done good service in bringing this matter forward, and I hope honorable members will take the matter to heart and curtail their speeches. </para>

            <para>- The honorable member who has just sat down has. charged the Opposition with having taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by the motion to attack the Government, but I do not think, that any more serious charge could be brought against the Government than that levelled at them by the honorable member for Bland, who accused them of having. been wanting in method. The members of the Opposition have been altogether too generous with the Government, and much of the time that has been spent in connexion with the Public Service Bill, and other measures, has been occupied by honorable members, on the Government side of the House. So far as the Opposition is concerned, they have abstained from those obstructive tactics which have caused so much waste of time in the State Parliaments, and cannot be accused of any fractious opposition. This attitude on their part has been so marked that they have been exposed to reproach in their own States' on the ground that they have not been sufficiently active in the discharge of their legislative duties. We had. a repetition of. State parliamentary procedure in. connexion, with the Governor-General's speech by the Prime Minister, who indulged in the practice of. what Ls called " dressing the shop window"; and although we may forgive him for that, we cannot pardon him for putting on the business paper a number of measures which are nothing but political dummies. As honorable members do not wish to sit here all the year round, I hope we shall soon have a declaration of the intentions of the Ministry. I hope the motion will have the effect of giving the House some idea as to what business is to be gone on with. I think that the suggestion to follow the example of the Senate in sitting upon Wednesday, Thursday, and.- Friday in each week is a good one. Such a practice would meet the convenience of many honorable members from the other States, and would certainly remove the objection raised by the honorable and learned member for Parkes. </para>

              <para>- If such an arrangement were made, honorable members from the other States could arrive in Melbourne on the Wednesday, and the House could meet at. half-past ten on Fridays, as does the Senate. There are a large number of professional men from the adjoining States in the Senate, and they find that the practice which I have mentioned works admirably. AVith regard to the absence of Ministers from the chamber whilst Parliament is sitting, I merely wish to say that if one or two of them, in addition to the Minister in charge of the Bill engaging attention, had remained in the House, they would on many occasions have probably exercised a controlling influence over their supporters, and thus have curtailed debate. I do not say that the Opposition is a model one, but certainly it cannot be charged with having, obstructed the progress of public business. I have no desire to see the practices and tricks which are resorted to in our State Legislatures repeated in our national Parliament. I will never lend my assistance to mere factions opposition. As the business people of Australia are so intensely concerned to know what the Tariff will be I trust that this debate will have the effect of hastening, its introduction to the notice of this House. </para>

              <para>- I have not brought down those figures, but I. am sure that the right honorable and learned member will desire to see our local industries encouraged. The question of what duty shall "be levied, of course, is not in the slightest degree raised by the consideration of this measure. This Bill applies only to the distillation of spirits on which any duty of excise is imposed by the Parliament. After the imposition of that duty, it applies to the exclusion of all State Acts regulating the distillation of excisable spirits. Two modes are provided in which spirits may be distilled - at least two modes of any importance. One is by means of a distiller's licence, in which case the distiller pays a larger fee and has the right to distil as he pleases : and the other is by means of a vigneron's still, which permits vignerons to distil spirit for the purpose of fortifying wine. There are also test stills provided for, which are of a small and unimportant character, but in respect of which, however - as they may be used for the purpose of distilling spirits - it is just as well that the Customs should know all about them, in order that an eye can be kept upon them. </para>

              <para>- No ; because there is no proposal here at present for an excise upon oil, and I take it that our power to regulate distillation - seeing that it is not a matter of Inter-State trade - is connected with the necessities of the Commonwealth in regard to the regulation and protection of excise. Right through the Bill it is made perfectly clear that we are aiming only at the regulation of the production of excisable spirits. I may say that I had, when drafting the Bill, included manufacturing stills ; but upon reconsideration of the question, and seeing that these stills could not be used for the purpose of distilling spirits, I took it that we had no right to interfere, but ought to leave the matter as now, to State legislation. For instance, we ordinarily find in distillation Bills a reference to the regulation of salt water stills, or what are generally known in Western Australia as condensers. It struck me - and further consideration confirms my opinion - that to attempt to regulate those stills would be assuming a right to interfere in a matter which did not concern us, and accordingly the provision was struck out. I confess that when I first looked at the draft material for this Bill which was submitted for Ministerial consideration, I stood almost aghast. It is not an attractive subject by any means. There is a wealth of detail presented which is very troublesome. Having been at some pains to master it, I thought it would be well to put a clause in the Bill which at the earliest stage of its consideration would assist honorable members to an appreciation of the information which I have before me. Hence the appearance of clause 5, which declares for convenience in interpreting the Act, the present ordinary course in connexion with the distillation of spirits as follows : - (i.) The material is mashed in a mash tun. The liquor product is wort. (ii.) The wort is fermented in a back. The liquor product is wash. (iii.) The wash is distilled ina still by heating to evaporation and condensing the vapor. The liquor product is spirits and the residue of the wash is spent wash. </para>

              <para>- I think there is no doubt about that. The form of the clause is an innovation to some -extent, but an innovation of which I heartily approve, although I am not the author, as it tends to that simplicity in our legislation which we should desire, and which the Government are striving after. Schedule 3 contains a variety of provisions with reference to distillation, and various forms are provided for. Something has been said by one honorable member in reference to the provisions relating to vigneron's licences, and particularly in regard to portable stills. In clause 105, of schedule 3, page 24, we have provided that two or more vignerons having each a vignerons' licence may by permission use a portable still, to be removed from time to time to the licensed premises where its use is required. These are generally the provisions of the Bill. It follows to a very great extent on the lines of the usual excise legislation. I trust that I have given honorable members such information as will assist them in its consideration. I shall be happy to supplement it with any other information they may desire. </para>

          <para>- There seems to be an idea that economy is obtained by exempting one department of a Government service from paying for the conveniences which are provided by another department, but, if the matter be looked into, it will be seen that there is no saving, and that, as we are always endeavouring to ascertain what the actual cost of the departments is, it is necessary that all who use the facilities which they provide should pay for them. I understood the honorable member in charge of the Bill to say that the clause would apply to tramways. If that is so, we may, if we pass it, run upon a constitutional snag, because the point may be taken that it is beyond the powers of the Commonwealth to enact that the railways, tramways, wharfs, and jetties of the States shall be used by the Commonwealth free of duty or toll. In the State from which I come there are many cases in which the officers of one department are permitted to use the conveniences of another department without paying for them. For instance, a great many of the departments are allowed to use the water provided by the Water and Sewerage Board free of charge; but surely it is not conducive to the accurate statement of the financial position of the departments that this should be allowed? The legal difficulty to which I refer seems to me a more serious matter. Is the Minister, after consultation with the Attorney-General, of opinion that the Commonwealth has power to arbitrarily claim certain privileges in respect to State property without paying for them? If we have not, the clause must beultravires. </para>

In my view, it involves an interference with the rights of a number of State institutions, such as Harbor Trusts. The question is whether the Federal Parliament has power to exempt certain federal services from the payment of tolls and dues. The proposition is that certain federal materials and articles shall have the advantage of State services free of charge. </para>

          <para>- There are two matters to be considered in connexion with this clause, and one is the element of mutuality. I understand that the Postmaster-General intends to charge all State departments for services rendered by his department, and surely it will be fair for the Postal department to pay for such services as may be rendered to it by other departments. Then again, section 114 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth shall not impose any tax upon property of any kind belonging to a State. Now, in Western Australia the wharfs and piers used for shipping purposes belong to the State, and a charge is levied upon all goods or luggage landed thereon. If the clause is carried in its present form, it will practically say that the Government of Western Australia must render service to the Postal department of the Commonwealth without the payment that is exacted from others, and to that extent it seems to me that the clause runs contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. It is a question, therefore, whether the clause should remain in the Bill or not. </para>

          <para>- I think the whole clause ought to be withdrawn. I believe that if we choose to exercise it, we have the power to do as the clause proposes ; but I think we ought to bear steadily in mind the distinction between two different principles. I think that while it has been held in the American courts that the Federal Government - here the Federal Parliament - has power in relation to the matters within its jurisdiction - and while it might be held that we have jurisdiction over every foot of Australian soil, and over every Australian citizen- we should exercise that power, so far as the Postal department is concerned, so as to prevent any obstruction of the national service. We are bound to see that no State, no State official, and no private citizen shall, in any way, lay an obstruction in the path of the services relating to posts and telegraphs. But when we pass that line, and say that private individuals and States shall render services to the Commonwealth, in relation to the Post and Telegraph department, for? nothing, I think we go too far. It is, to my mind, an improper thing to exact a service from others without any remuneration. I have failed to hear any justification for the clause, and until I do so, I counsel the Government to withdraw it. </para>

          <para>. - The justification of this clause from the Post-office point of view, is first that a provision of this kind exists practically in every State. What no doubt has been overlooked is that in each State the Government has thus, as a rule, simply provided that one department shall not make charges upon another department, while now when a new Government is created it does not follow that the same principle can be applied. But there is a second justification which ought not to be lost sight of, although from experience in this State one is not able to suggest any instance in which any difficulty has occurred. The principle of the clause is that there must be no obstacle not only to the transaction of postal business in general but to the speedy and expeditious discharge of the duties cast upon that department. There must be an absolutely free passage for His Majesty's mails, and this clause provides that officers of the Postal department are not to be "held up" by reason of the levy of tolls or charges of that kind. If the committee scrutinize this clause they will see that its operation is narrower than they might glean from a general reading. It relates to duties or tolls payable only on wharfs, in the one case, and on ferries or turnpikes in the other. All the paragraphs except one relate only to the person carrying the mails or to the horse or the vehicle. These charges throughout the Commonwealth will really be inconsiderable. The important paragraph is paragraph. {/), which is worded in a way that might give rise to some difficult and delicate questions. But, as it seems to me, the main objection which can be urged against the clause is that it does not make the provision that is afterwards made in regard to railways. Clause 16 gives some such exemption with regard to railways as is here conferred with regard to piers, wharfs, and turnpikes. The object of clause 16 is to give free passage to His Majesty's mails, and the object of clause 17 is, that having secured that free passage, the Government shall not take it without paying a proper price. There appears to be no subsequent clause which bears the same relation to clause 13 that clause 17 is intended to bear to clause 16. It is, however, possible to supplement the proposals contained in clause 13. </para>

            <para>- We can do anything necessary to secure in the Post and Telegraph department the efficient discharge of its duties. That efficient discharge implies that the mails must riot be capable of being stopped by any question of toll, fare, or rate, but we ought at the same time make some general arrangement for payment for that service. We should thus secure efficient service, and pay for it, so that no one would actually suffer. However, the proposal that this clause shall be postponed, with a view to the consideration of this compensation question, is a reasonable one. With a view to obtaining further information from the Post-office itself my colleague has therefore agreed to the course suggested. This discussion will not have been idle if it leads to the clause being inserted in a more equitable form. There can be no question of constitutionality. </para>

            <para>- It was said elsewhere, that one reason why this proviso should be inserted was that it was an admirable proposal. It was said elsewhere also by a representative of the Government that the one reason why it should not be accepted was that although it was very admirable, it would be very unfortunate in its. effects, that it would be a highly unfortunate thing to enforce it; and what is more, that if it were in force it would have no practical effect. It was asserted by nearly all who opposed- the proposal elsewhere, that the British race, so far as they were employed at sea, were deteriorating and dying out. It was urged with all the force of a gentleman who had discovered one of the primal laws of nature, that the lascar is a British subject. If a man had suddenly discovered a sixth sense, or had tumbled upon the fourth dimension, he could not have announced the fact more triumphantly than these honorable gentlemen announced that the lascar was a British subject. But something more was wanted, in refutation of such an amendment as this, than the bald assertion that India is part of the British Empire. We know that it is. I understand that one honorable member, of another place, said that we in Australia, and our fellow British subjects in India, are on precisely the same footing. I utterly deny that. If any honorable member is impatient of achieving at once an eternal glory and a life-long exclusion from the walls of this gilded chamber, let him go outside and make that statement. Let him point out that the gentlemen who comes round with a vocabulary of from sixteen to 22 words, and asks us to buy anything from a bottle of pickles to a highly embroidered petticoat is on the same footing with us. Let him tell that to the highly intelligent elector, and although he may be broad-minded, yet so surely as he makes that statement will the elector relegate him to where such statements deserve to place him. An honorable member of another place said he regretted that there had been intruded into this debate an amendment which threatened to disrupt the British Empire. It was mentioned by these gentlemen, as one of the arguments against such a proposal, that the British Empire would totter to its fall if this proposal were incorporated in the Bill. I want to urge some reasons against such a contention. I have pointed out on several occasions - and, indeed, when before my constituents, I was at some pains to show that it was essential, if we were to have any sort of defence force by sea in time of danger - that our mercantile marine should be recruited from the white nations of the world, and if possible, from the British race. Lord Brassey has pointed out the melancholy, but undeniable, fact that the British mercantile white marine has decreased 50 per cent. in the last 25 years. Twenty-five years ago there were 200,000; their number is now 1 00,000. We do not propose now to compel any company to employ white labour. All that we ask is that when we ourselves subsidize a shipping company that that company shall employ only white labour. Even if the British Government refuses to enter into an arrangement with us in these circumstances, we shall be no worse off than we are now, because every steamer is compelled to carry mails. The only thing that the contract does is to provide that the mails shall be carried within a specified time. We can send our mails by any steamer we like. </para>

I agree with a great deal that he has said, and no one is less inclined than I am for the employment of coloured labour in connexion with any of our mail contracts. 1 indicated that the other night. We should not be embarrassed in applying the honorable member's proposal to the conveyance of our inland and coastal mails. There is no difficulty in that ; but the case is different with regard to our oversea mails. The contracts made with the P. and O. and Orient Steamship Companies for the conveyance of mails - and they are the principal companies involved - were made with them by the Imperial Government. The subsidy paid on this account in 1899 amounted to £170,000, of which the United Kingdom contributed £98,000, and the six States of Australia £72,000. That contract expires in 1905, and there cannot easily be a revision of it until that date. </para>

The amendment would raise an issue which requires to be dealt with I admit, but I propose to put certain provisions in this clause in block and white, which, while making it clear that there shall be no intrusion of black labour into our land service, or into our coastal contracts, will insure that any future contracts for an over sea service shall be laid before Parliament, and shall not come into force until they have received the express approval of both Houses. That that will give Parliament an opportunity of expressing its opinion in all cases, and at the same time the provision will not interfere by anticipation with the contract to which we are already bound. It will give us a free hand in regard to those contracts in which we are the sole participants on the one side, while in regard to those in which we are not the sole participants, we shall have an opportunity of estimating what will be the burden, or whether -we should join with the United Kingdom or launch out for ourselves. </para>

            <para>- I do not see that there would be any difficulty on that ground. The contract between the New South Wales Government and the company which runs the Vancouver mail service is carried out under conditions which require the employment of white labour, and seeing that during the whole time we have had the Orient Company's service until just recently the work in the stoke-holes has been done by white labour - as I saw myself when on the Red Sea - and when we know, as has been pointed out by the mover of this motion, that coloured labour is not used in the stoke-holes of our men-of-war, I do not think there should be any difficulty in our- securing a contract in the future under conditions requiring the employment of white labour only. I think this is a question that Parliament ought to have the power to decide for itself at the expiration of the present contract, or at such other time as the question may arise whether a new contract should be entered into in conjunction with Great Britain or by the Commonwealth purely in its own behalf. Assuming that the Parliament four or five years hence will be animated by the same spirit as this Parliament, I think an opportunity should be afforded for expressing approval or disapproval of any proposals that may be brought forward at that time. I do not want to do anything at the present stage that might force us into the position of either accepting a contract involving the employment of black labour, or undertaking a burden that would be entirely inconsistent with our financial position, and perhaps in the end leave us without any contract at all. No honorable member, I om sure, is anxious to see that result. We do not want to be put to the necessity of choosing such an alternative. It is preferable that we should have an opportunity of dealing with circumstances as they arise. It will be a sufficient protection if we provide that the contract, whatever it may be, shall be laid before each House, and that it shall . not be accepted without confirmation by the vote of both Houses. I think there is the germ of 'a solution of this matter in that proposal, and, if the clause is postponed, I will, in the meantime, endeavour to frame a clause which I hope will meet with the views of the House. </para>

          <para>- While I admit that the Government are entitled to the time necessary to enable them to consider the position and to draft another clause to meet the difficulty, I think the suggestion of the Prime Minister falls a long way short of what is required. The idea of leaving the matter over until the present contract expires or until a new mail contract is made, seems to me to be altogether inadequate, for the reason that every year of delay will accentuate the difficulty of dealing with the subject, especially if, as seems likely from recent developments in connexion with the Orient Company, the number of lascars employed on the mail steamers is increased from year to year. At the present time the Orient Company have only one vessel on this coast manned by lascars, but their intention, as shown in the reply to a question put to the Postmaster-General in the British House of Commons, is, unless something extraordinary occurs, to increase the proportion of lascars employed on their steamers. The same thing will happen, in all probability, in connexion with all the other lines of steamers, because competition be- comes keener with the employment of low-priced labour. Although the directors of the Orient Company have laid some stress on the drunkenness and lack of discipline of the white stokers previously employed, I do not believe that is altogether the reason for making the change. That is comparatively a small matter, and I think it is a question of wages for the most part. It is certainly peculiar that tramp vessels, that have not high-class engines or anything like the same ventilation facilities as the Orient boats, employ white stokers through the Red Sea and in all other parts of the world. Therefore it seems to me that the reason given is a preposterous one. All the other British over sea lines, except the mail steamers, are manned by white men, a very large proportion of whom are British subjects. I would like the clause postponed so that we may see whether it would not be possible, in addition to insisting on white labour, to require that a certain proportion of the men employed should be British subjects. In dealing with one aspect of the remarks of the Prime Minister, we have to consider that the difference between the steamers which come here from over sea is gradually being reduced so far as speed is concerned, and with the gradual increase of trade between the Commonwealth and abroad it is not to be thought that we shall suffer any serious delay in the delivery of our mails. I believe that within a few years from now we shall be able to do without the payment of a large subsidy, and to rely upon vessels carrying mail matter at the usual rates that are paid throughput the world for such services. That is another reason why I think this matter is not so serious so far as any possible refusal on the part of the Orient or P. and O. Companies is concerned, but I trust that the Government will see their way to go much further than the Prime Minister has gone this afternoon, because the main point is that we want to have a decision on the part of Parliament some time before it is necessary to renew the contract, so that the mail companies may know under what conditions they will require to ' work if the contract is to be renewed. If that is not done they will probably put forward a number of conditions which, under the circumstances, may have some weight, and we may be confronted with the necessity of either having lascar labour or taking slower mails. When this matter comes on again, I hope that we shall come to a decision whether we are going to have these undesirable people in competition with our own men on our own coasts, or whether we are going to insist upon other conditions. </para>

          <para>- I have no objection to the clause being postponed, as I think the request a reasonable one, but I wish to point out that the Prime Minister may see some difficulty in carrying out the views he has indicated. A fresh mail contract will require to be negotiated some two years before the expiration of the existing arrangement, because the steamship companies will want to know what the conditions of the new service are to be in order that they may make the necessary arrangements beforehand. The Prime Minister's proposal will not meet that necessity, because it simply requires that a contract shall be negotiated and laid before Parliament for ratification before it is carried into effect. The result will be that the whole question will be submitted to the House with a distinct declaration from the Home Government on the question, and once the Home Government have declared themselves, we might not be able to induce them to reconsider their decision That has been the difficulty which we have always encountered in connexion with this black labour question. On the last occasion we stood out strenuously till a cable was received from England stating that in no circumstances could Her Majesty's Government consent to the making of a contract which would confer a preference as between her individual subjects. It seemed to us, therefore, that nothing more could be done. We had either to go on with the contract or to negotiate a contract of our own independently of the Home Government. We should occupy precisely a similar position under the proposal of the right honorable gentleman. When this matter is reconsidered in committee, I think that we should definitely provide that our mails should be carried by white labour, and that such labour shall not be beaten off the boats by the coloured workers of other countries. The point we should insist upon is that it is the companies themselves who are making the preference. We Are acting on the defensive in this particular matter. The sooner that point is made clear to the home authorities, the better chance shall we have of getting our own labour restored to these boats. </para>

          <para>- I have no objection to the postponement of the clause for further consideration, but I hold very strong opinions upon the question of employing coloured labour in connexion with our mail contracts. In times of national emergency, we must look to our mercantile marine to assist in fighting our battles. If the naval defence of these States were to be left exclusively to the coloured races, there might be some ground for the contention that only that class of labour should be employed on our mail steamers. But when trouble comes, I am afraid that the lascar will disappear, and we shall have to look to the British bulldog to fight our battles. As custodians of the ' public purse, we should see that the men employed upon mail steamers, which we subsidize, are those of our own race. They will thus be able to gain experience to equip them for service in our naval defence, should the. occasion ever require it. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to the time when the last mail contract was signed, and has stated that the objections of the home authorities to distinguishing between lascar seamen and white seamen could not be overcome. I would point out, however, that a considerable change of public opinion has taken place in the old country. Whether we postpone this clause or not there must be an understanding that some such provision is inserted. If we cany such a clause, it will have a great effect upon any future arrangements that Great Britain may enter into. Public opinion there is ripening rapidly in favour of the employment of only British white seamen on our mail boats, in order that we may keep the British marine as a part of the British nation. </para>

The patriotism that has been exhibited by our colonists in the past has been recognised, and we want it to be known that if there is to be a nation upon this continent, it shall be a white nation. Even if we have to enter into fresh contracts at a little more cost in order to secure the employment of our own people upon these mail steamers, I think that we should readily undertake the task. Whilst I agree that there can be no harm in postponing the clause I hope that when the Prime Minister comes down with an amendment it will be such as will satisfy those who desire to see only white labour employed upon our mail steamers. </para>

It seems to me that the present system is simply one of universal taxation for the killing-off of the white sailor and the advancement of the black man. The whole cry now is that the white man has reached the stage when he is absolutely useless, and it is urged that we must not interfere with the British subject. But to-day we are allowing the subsidized mail boats with their coloured labour to kill off our Inter-State navigation trade. With all due respect to the Prime Minister, I hope that we shall notify that the Commonwealth of Australia is not going to tolerate any scheme which has for its object the destruction of the white man and the elevation of the coloured man. </para>

It appears to me that under its provisions, the Governor-General may make arrangements with the States or local governing bodies, for certain contributions towards the establishment of postal facilities. Are we to understand that the State departments are to get their postal facilities upon some small contribution, or are they to be charged the same rate as that fixed for private persons ? So far as I can see, the Commonwealth will be called upon to pay for every facility it requires, and on the other hand I wish to know whether it is to get some payment from the States in return for the postal facilities which it affords them ? </para>

I have known, for instance, of a particular locality, which did not warrant, by its size and the amount of postal business done, the erection of a clock tower in connexion with the Post-office, but the department might enter into an arrangement with such a district, under a clause of this kind, to build what it considered to be a suitable post-office, and to add a clock-tower or some architectural display, towards the cost of which the locality might be prepared to contribute. Then, again, an outlying district, where the number of residents would not warrant a a special contract for the delivery of mails, might yet induce the Postmaster-General by paying some contribution from its local funds or by private contributions, to provide a special service. The clause would also enable persons, in cases where a postal cart is passing by their premises day by day, to make a special payment of £1, £2, or £3 per annum, and have their letters delivered in a postal box at their own gate. </para>

The honorable member, when Postmaster-General in New South Wales, must have leant to that practice. I have felt justified in doing so, although there was no law to warrant it, and have always been supported by Parliament. The Postmaster-General would also be able, under this clause, to accept contributions towards a special service for an outlying district, which might be challenged in Parliament if the whole cost had to be borne by the Commonwealth. I think nothing special in the way of taxation will be demanded from these districts. Postmasters-General in the past have always been extremely liberal in dealing with them. </para>

The Minister has to some extent confirmed the worst fears which were entertained concerning this provision, to which I gave utterance when I spoke on . the second reading. The clause provides that the Postmaster-General may call upon the local governing body of a district to indemnify him for any loss that may be incurred in giving that district postal or other facilities. If, for example, a district such as that which I represent, which now receives a fortnightly mail, should, six months hence, desire a mail twice a week, the Minister might or might not grant its request. </para>

            <para>- I admit that there is a difficulty, and therefore I do not agree with the honorable member for Parramatta that the -clause should be negatived ; but a middle course should be discoverable. It may be urged that no Postmaster-General would be so inconsiderate or inexperienced in the conditions of the back country as to refuse such a request, or to compel persons living in remote parts of the country to contribute t towards the cost of providing additional facilities, and it might further be urged that the House would not permit him to do so ; but, if such a request were refused, what chance would an uninfluential member like myself have of inducing the House to cause the Postmaster-General to revoke his decision ? In many of the remote portions of the interior the mail coach is the only connecting link with civilization. In populous centres the people have the public parks, the gardens, and the theatres in which to spend their idle moments ; but in the outlying portions of the continent, where people are perhaps 300 or 400 miles away from a railway station, in an arid, monotonous wilderness, their chief pleasure is the receipt of newspapers and letters from their friends elsewhere ; and the more you increase their facilities, the more tolerable you make their lives. Surely the pioneers who have redeemed the wilderness for civilization deserve all the consideration we can give them. I would point out, too, that although the clause permits, the Postmaster-General to contract with any local governing body, the funds at the disposal of these bodies may be appropriated for certain purposes, and for no other purposes. In Western Australia, the Municipalities Act provides that the rates and the Government endowment shall be spent upon the improvement of the streets, the maintenance of sanitation, and in other specified ways, and, unless there is an amendment of that Act, the local governing bodies there could not devote any portion of their funds to indemnifying the Postmaster-General against loss. </para>

          <para>- Honorable members seem to be trying very industriously to read into this clause provisions which it does not contain. The clause is simply intended to provide specifically for what has been the practice in the States for some time past. It has been customary to give improved facilities in connexion with mails where those immediately concerned have been prepared to guarantee any extra expense that might be involved, and it seems to me that that is a very proper principle to adopt. No Government department ought to confine itself within arbitrary lines to its own business, but where it can generally promote the convenience of the people it ought to do so. The clause provides that bargains can be made only where the people are voluntarily disposed to enter into special arrangements with the Postmaster-General in order to obtain special facilities. </para>

          <para>- I think that it is not necessary that this clause should be embodied in the Bill. As we have done in the past, so let us act in the future. These arrangements, if necessary, could be made without having a whip held over the heads of those who desire extra postal and other facilities. The only tangible benefit which many people resident throughout the scattered country districts derive from the Government is derived through the medium of the Post and Telegraph office. I urge upon honorable members that they should rest content with the present condition of affairs and not hand over to the Postmaster-General such a power as he would have under .this clause. With such a provision operative he would be able to refuse almost every application that was made to him, because he would interpret this as an instruction from Parliament that no loss should accrue to the department. In my opinion, the success of the Postal department cannot be gauged by the monetary i return which it secures. It is one of the most potent civilizing influences that we have, and in that respect is well worthy almost any cost to which it may put the Government. I should not be surprised to hear the supporters of this clause urging that in the great centres of population, where the Postal department is run at a profit, the cost of telegrams and postage stamps should be reduced. I hope that the clause will be struck out. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. It refers to " additional " facilities. There must be some facilities given to a particular district before there can be any charge made for additional facilities. I think we shall find that the Postal department is prepared to give the proper facilities to all outlying districts. One State alone is not interested in this question. All the States contain districts in respect of which the Postmaster-General will have to put his 'hands in his pocket to provide the necessary postal facilities. He will, no doubt, give these facilities gladly. When, however, it comes to a question of a district bringing special pressure to bear upon him to acquire facilities in addition to those which are given to districts of a similar character, it is quite right that the Postmaster-General should be able to say - " I will give you these facilities if you are prepared to help yourselves to get them." That, I think, is a very proper principle to embody in our legislation. 1 1 will prevent a great deal of trouble in the future. If Sydney and Melbourne required a special line for telephone purposes, it would be hardly fair to cast the cost of that line on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth generally. This clause gives power to the Governor-General to make arrangements with the States as well as with individuals. The States will not be very much concerned in regard to the few people in the backwoods ; but they will not be left to themselves under a just administration of the Postal department. They will get the facilities they ought to receive ; and if any town requires greater facilities than are generally given to such localities, it is to the interests of the Commonwealth that it should pay for it. </para>

          <para>- If I interpreted this clause as some honorable members interpret it, I should certainly vote against it. I understand that it is simply to give the" force of law to what has been the practice in the past. If that practice is to be maintained it ought to have the force of law. My experience in regard to postal guarantees is that, if the business which results from the increased facilities is shown to reasonably warrant the extra service, very fair consideration is extended by the Postmaster-General. I therefore think the Minister ought to have the power by law to make these arrangements. I do not think it will affect outside country places at all ; if I did I should vote against it. It appears to me that it is rather aimed at ornamental towers and expensive clocks, which are never erected in country districts, but are' asked for by large centres of population. If the Minister were backed up by such a power as this he would be able to say to the large deputations which make such requests that he was prepared, where the work would cost £300, for example, to contribute £50 towards it. We have heard a lot about the erection of expensive clock towers in New South Wales. Honorable members, however, should be fair. I see no reason for making these State distinctions. As a matter of fact, it will be shown when the proposals come before the House for expenditure on post-offices, that for every thousand re- quired in 'New South Wales, eight or ten times that amount will be necessary in Victoria, because it is notorious that in the time of depression the Victorian votes of public buildings were very much cut down. We do not want, however, to make any such distinctions. I hope the clause will be passed, because I have had half-a-dozen notices recently from the Post-office, pointing out that until some definite system hast been arranged in regard to such matters as these it is impossible for the department to give the small conveniences asked for. If we sweep away the clause we simply return to the haphazard way of the past, and allow the Postmaster-General to attempt guarantees, and to afterwards modify them or let them go altogether. Those who desire to safeguard the revenue and at the same time to look after the country districts will vote for it. </para>

          <para>- This appeal's to me to be a very useful clause. What is sought to be done by it is already being carried on in the different States, but we might experience a very great deal more difficulty in following the same course under the federal administration unless we have some such provision as is proposed. Supposing South Australia desired to extend a telegraph line to some of the more remote districts of the northern territory, from which no payable results could be expected for many years, the other States might be prepared to bear a portion of the expense of such a work, but they might very properly object to bearing the whole of the loss that would result. This clause, however, would enable the State to enter into a special agreement by which it would take upon itself some of the deficiency. With a provision of this kind they might be willing to contribute a small proportion of the loss. This clause merely gives the Postmaster-General power to enter into an equitable arrangement of that kind if he thinks, it desirable so to do. We must assume that the Postal department will be administered by men who have the interests of the Commonwealth at heart, and that they will not administer it in the way that a great many honorable members seem to fear.

          <para>- If the committee divide upon this clause I shall support the Ministry. It seems to me that the principle embodied in the clause is a fairly good one. We are told that the Post and Telegraph service throughout the various States has so far not been self-supporting, and that the desire of the Ministry is to make it so. To my mind that is a laudable ambition. At the same time we have to remember that there are many small places which stand in need of postal facilities, and if the Postmaster-General is not able to give them those facilities, it is far better that the people desiring them should put their hands into their pockets, and assist in a small way in getting what they desire, than that they should be denied the privileges which they seek. </para>

          <para>- I should like to draw the attention of the committee both to the general object of this clause, and to the very peculiar way in which that object is controlled. The reference to the Victorian Postal Act in the marginal note is somewhat misleading. Any one looking at it would infer that this method of fixing the postal rates had been borrowed from the Victorian law, whereas, as a matter of fact, it is not. The clause proposes to settle one of the most difficult questions of policy and finance by a regulation of the Governor-General. We all know that throughout the various States for a considerable time past the question of State penny postage, universal or limited, has been discussed, and that now the question of Commonwealth penny postage, universal or limited, is arousing a great deal of public attention. In view of the large number of other subjects to which this Parliament is called upon to devote attention - subjects which are not nearly of such importance to the people of Australia - it strikes me as peculiar that Parliament should not have the power of fixing the skeleton of its own schedule of rates. I recognise that it is impossible to settle the rate of postage for Australia in this Bill. But the obvious answer to that is - " Leave the clause out, so far as it concerns the postal rates." When the Ministry is prepared to come down to Parliament, and to say whether they are going to have a uniform postage for Australia, and whether it is to he a penny postage or a twopenny postage, let them bring down a Bill, and allow Parliament to decide the matter. I do not know whether any of the States have settled their postage rates by regulations authorized by the Governor in Council ; certainly the State of Victoria has never done so. It has always been recognised that this is a matter for the determination of Parliament, directly and not indirectly. </para>

            <para>- It is certainly not the same. In Victoria an Act of Parliament settles what the rates are to be, whereas this proposal is that the Governor-General shall fix the rates by Executive act. This proposal goes further than any Victorian Parliament would have ever dreamed of going. We do not want to have to resort to that method more often than can be helped. To my mind we should legislate by regulation only whore Parliament is unable to give the time, or has not the knowledge to legislate directly. Legislation by regulation is only a substitute, and often a poor substitute, for legislation by enactment. After the Government scale of rates is framed, it is to be laid before both Houses of Parliament within fourteen days of its making, if Parliament be sitting, and if not, then within fourteen days after the next meeting of Parliament and if either of the said Houses does not, within fourteen days after such scale has been so laid before it, resolve that such rates and charges or any of them ought not to come into force, they are to become law. That means that if the Government tables its schedule of rates, and one of the two Houses disapproves of them, while the other does nothing, they are to become law. The Government proposal is to substitute for the approval of two Houses the disapproval of one and. the silence of another. We had a discussion the other day on the question of how certain regulations should become law. Contrary to my desire it was determined that one House alone could disapprove of the regulations made under the authority of an Act of Parliament, and that if either House did disapprove of them, then they could not come into force. I said at the time that to my mind both Houses should have to disapprove in order to prevent these regulations from coming into operation, once we had deliberately delegated to the Executive the power to make such regulations. There are three stages in connexion with preventing regulations from coming into law. We have either the disapproval of both Houses or the disapproval of one House. The clause, however, goes further, and it says that the disapproval of one House and the silence of the other will allow the scale to become law. </para>

            <para>- But it does not say so. It means exactly the opposite. It is the most remarkable instance of law-making that I have yet come across. If it be proposed to allow the other branch of the Legislature to disapprove of the scale, what will this House say ? Will this House go so far in regard to regulations dealing with the taxation of the people? I say most emphatically that Parliament should adopt the sensible plan of leaving a large question of public policy like this to be determined specifically by Parliament, and not by the Executive. The business of the Executive is administration, and the power to determine policy should never be taken out of the hands of Parliament. It may be, with regard to telegraph rates, that there are practical difficulties in the way which prevent us fixing them in the schedule of an Act of Parliament. I do not know whether there are or not. I do know, however, that the States, as regards their postal rates, almost invariably determine them specifically, and fix them in a schedule to an Act of Parliament, and not by a mere Act of the Executive Council. I quite admit that we cannot do it in this Bill, because we are not ready. In my opinion, however, we should leave the matter over until we are ready.

          <para>- I feel sure the Minister will make himself satisfied on the point. I never interfere with questions of drafting in committee unless there is a very glaring case,, but I have very grave doubts as to whether, when. we give the Governor-General power to fix the rate of postage on postal articles,, we do not mean that he is to fix the rate of postage on all articles within his ken and jurisdiction. However, that can be put right if it is not so. The point with regard to the machinery for dealing with rates by this House has been well put by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. I do not think that the clause is workable. I think in the first place that to lay rates before both Houses of Parliament, and to require them to be dealt with within fourteen days is really no safeguard. It gives no practical power to the House. It is one qf those 'devices which one often sees in Bills. It keeps the word of promise to the ear, but breaks it in real effect. It is a privilege given to the House which is no real privilege. We cannot condemn a scale of rates in fourteen days. Unless we are prepared to face the responsibility of having no rate for some particular postal article, we must leave it as it stands. The only power we have is to say that some one or more of these rates shall not stand. We should probably be told by the Minister that if we abolished the rates on newspapers, for instance, which were put down in the schedule, we should have no rates at. all, and therefore we should have to leave it. We ought to have power to alter or vary the rate if we think fit. I think that perhaps the committee will hardly be prepared to accept the amendment, but some alteration should be made in sub-clause (2), which will give this House more power than is given it under the present wording of the clause. </para>

          <para>- The honorable member for Corinella stated that the ' clause was a matter of taxation ;. but* it is -not a question of taxation, but of services rendered ; and it is therefore not so necessary that it should be dealt with by both Houses as if it were a matter of taxation. I would like members of the committee to read in connexion with this clause the provisions of clause 2 of the Bill, which we have postponed. Under that provision the existing; postal rates throughout the various States are to continue, obviously for the reason that for a certain period it will be necessary that the States shall have some voice in controlling their own revenue ? Any alteration at the present time in the rates of postage in the State of Tasmania, which would put them on an equality with the rates in Victoria, would mean an immediate loss of £20,000 a year to that State. When the revenues of the post-offices in the different States shall be sufficiently buoyant to warrant the reconsideration of the rates throughout the Commonwealth, there can be little doubt that, whatever Postmaster-General is in office, he will be only too anxious to give the community the advantages of a uniform and cheaper rate. Judging from conversations I have had with the Postmaster-General and with Ministers, the purpose is to move tentatively for the first year or two of our Commonwealth experience, and, before making any great changes, see what the possibilities of our revenue are likely to be. </para>

            <para>- If that is not what the clause says, some other language must be employed to give effect to that intention, because it is clear that a matter of this importance ought not to be relegated either to one House or the other. We should not intrust either branch of the Legislature with the power to undo or confirm what has been done by the Executive. </para>

          <para>- There can be no doubt that under this clause one House, by being perfectly inactive, may pass a law. It is the only instance 1 know of where such a proposal has been made. It provides that regulations shall be framed fixing a scale of rates, and presented to Parliament, and, if either House - it may be this House or the other Chamber - simply sits still and does nothing, then, no matter what the other House does, the scale of rates shall have the force of law. I should strongly object to that if it were not that the result would in the end leave this House master of the situation. If the Governor-General framed a scale of rates and charges and presented it to Parliament, the Senate by doing nothing, might, notwithstanding the disapproval of this House, bring that scale of charges into law, but the Government might re-introduce the regulations, and this House might reverse the position. I should like, however, to see this matter dealt with by Parliament, and not left to be decided by mere Executive regulations. I hope the Government may see their way to adopt the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Corinella, although, if they think that the exigencies of the case require that they should adopt the course propo'sed in the Bill, I will not go so far as to vote against it. </para>

          <para>. - I think that those honorable members are right who say that this is a clause which should not be assented to without mature deliberation, just as any rates or charges fixed under it should not be assented to without similar deliberation. The question, however, is whether there shall be an Act pf Parliament for fixing the rates of postage to be paid on postal articles - the amendment leaves untouched the power given to the Governor-General in Council to fix charges, subject to the veto of Parliament, for the transmission and delivery of telegrams. The amendment therefore discloses at once an unevenness in policy, because it seems to admit that without damage to the public interests the Governor-General in Council may fix the telegraphic rates, but may not fix postage rates. </para>

            <para>- I think I have followed the explanation of the honorable and learned member, but it leaves the matter of reason untouched. The matter of reason is this : - As we are making a Federal Act, why should we draw any distinction between postal and telegraph rates'? Surely, if it is a matter of policy, as it is . alleged to be, to fix the rates for services performed in the carriage of mails, it is equally in reason a matter of policy to fix the rates for services rendered by the Telegraph department. One can follow the reasons for drawing distinctions so far as the States are concerned, but we are now legislating upon a matter of federal policy, and the question for us to consider is this : There are places where these matters have hitherto been fixed by Executive order, and there are others in which it has been necessary, as in Victoria, to have an Act of Parliament. We have to ask ourselves -what is the position of the Commonwealth, vast as its ramifications are under the new order of things, and it seems to me that the balance of argument - admitting to the full the strength of what honorable members allege on the other side - is in favour of the course proposed in the Bill. I do not say that a modification may not be made in regard to the time within which a resolution of veto should be passed, but I think it is better to have the matter fixed as provided in the Bill, rather than to make it necessary to introduce an Act of Parliament for every change. The same principle applies to both postal and telegraphic rates, and if telegraphic rates can be changed by regulation, then we must cast about for some reason why we should not also change postal rates in the same way, so long as Parliament has its undoubted opportunity. </para>

            <para>- My honorable friend is confusing matters of taxation and matters of public service. These rates are for services rendered. No doubt it is a matter of policy to say how much shall be paid for the services. But the same .thing might be said in regard to the fixing of the railway rates. We leave those rates to Executive determination, upon the recommendation of the Railways Commissioner. Then they are laid upon the table of the House, and if not vetoed within a certain time, they have the force of law. The fixing of the rates upon our railways affords a very fair parallel to this case, because the fixing of those rates is as much a question of policy as the fixing of the rate of postage ever can be. They are both matters of service. When we consider the way in which the railway rates have been left to the commissioners, that it has been a matter of Executive arrangement as to what those rates shall be - although they affect from day to day the final policy of every State in which they art, charged - and when we remember that the absence or presence of a duty on a cereal importation, for instance, may be entirely strengthened or nullified by a railway rate passed with purely </para>

          <para>- I have listened with a good deal of attention to the speech just delivered by the Prime Minister. As a purely academic contribution to the discussion, I have every admiration for it. But# as a practical answer to the objections offered to the clause, I consider that it has served no purpose whatever. We cannot ignore the fact that this is an attempt to arrogate to the Government power to alter the postal and telegraphic rates of the Commonwealth by regulation instead of by Act of Parliament. The right honorable gentleman sought to draw a parallel between the fixing of the postal rates and the fixing of rates of carriage upon the railways. I venture to say that there is no parallel whatever. The Prime Minister announced at Maitland that the Government were going to introduce a penny postage scheme throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- The right honorable gentleman said to-night that when he announced at Maitland that the Government were going to introduce an old-age pension scheme, he qualified that statement. I invite him to show any qualification of that announcement in the report of his speech. I was one of the first to point out that if the taxation of this Commonwealth was to be confined to a Customs Tariff, it was impossible to carry out either of these proposals, because we have to collect £4 for every £1 which is really required. I also pointed out that the postal proposals would involve a further Customs taxation of £1,100,000. The Prime Minister knows that the Postal conference, after the most careful inquiry, reported that it would require £295,000 per annum to meet this extension of the penny postage system. The Prime Minister was there impliedly proposing to raise a further £1,100,000 through the Customs, if he really did not intend to resort to direct taxation. This clause is nothing less than an attempt to give to the Government the power to impose probably a further £1,100,000 worth of taxation upon this country by regulation, because the provision is quite unqualified. Every honorable member will admit that it is quite open to the Government to lay upon the table of the House regulations extending the penny postage system to every part of the Commonwealth, and involving us in this estimated loss of £295,000 per year. </para>

            <para>- I am not concerned with the question whether it is likely or not. I always notice that when honorable members are in office they are prepared to go to the utmost extent in taking power for their Government, forgetting that unprincipled men may come in from the Opposition side of the House and abuse the very power which they wish to take to themselves. I am against this power being conf erred on any Government. Can any honorable member recall any instance in the history of any State Parliament in which a Government was authorized, I will not say to impose taxation, but to do anything which involved an expenditure of £295,000 a year - by regulation? No one ever heard of such a thing. The Prime Minister ingenuously confesses that it is so much easier to do this by regulation than by Act of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- That does not alter the force of my argument a bit. Why do we require a Bill to go through three readings ? Why do we require the Minister -who introduces a Bill to get leave to introduce it? We do so because we recognise that when an important principle is sought to be placed on the statute-book, it is necessary to put it through a number of stages in order to secure for it the fullest discussion and criticism. The Prime Minister does not want to introduce a Bill involving this expenditure of £295,000ayear. Is it not all the more necessary in a Parliament like this, whose members in some cases come a thousand miles in order to attend its sittings, that we should know that the Government intend to introduce a Bill involving this important expenditure - not a capital expenditure of £295,000, but an expenditure of £295,000 a year? It involves something further, because if it is part of the Government policy that we are not to have direct taxation, does it not mean that this is a power by regulation to extend the postage, so as to involve the collection of a further sum of £1,100,000 per year through the Custom-house? That seems rather a strange statement to make, but it is what the clause involves. We have been told from time to time that the Tariff will be limited so as to produce such an amount as is required by the Commonwealth for Commonwealth purposes. It is a very easy matter to add £295,000 to the debit side of the Commonwealth, and then to say we shall have to levy a further £1,100,000. These regulations would make an extension of the penny postage law. If the expenditure is incurred, Parliament must find the money to make it up, and it must raise £4 through the Customs for every £1 it requires to make good the loss. I claim a right, as a member of this House, to have so important a step as that put through the usual processes of an Act of Parliament. I desire to have due notice from the Government that the House is going to be asked for leave to introduce a Bill ; I desire to know when it is to be introduced; I desire to have an opportunity of speaking on the second reading; and, more important than all, I desire to have something more than a mere negativing power in regard to such a matter. If these regulations are tabled, we can only say "No"; but if the proposal comes up in the form of a Bill, it can be modified and qualified in committee in such a way, perhaps, as to make it acceptable to the House. I object to government by regulation. The amount here is so large, and the principle so serious, that I will do my utmost to prevent the arrogating of this power to the Government by mere regulation. </para>

          <para>- The greatest acts of cruelty in the history of the world have been perpetrated under what are known as regulations. I am uncompromisingly opposed to the penny postage, because I look upon it as simply a measure to give relief to the wealthy at the expense of the poor. But let us suppose that after a champagne banquet with a few of . our friends from Europe, there is a declaration that we should have a uniform penny postage. The proposal is brought down and I come into the House to oppose it. I would be shot the next day. I want this Parliament to be the mouthpiece of the people, to say whether we shall have a penny postage or any other thing which will contribute to their benefit or their injury. I take another point. We expect . to make the papers in all the States pay newspaper postage ; but supposing there is pressure brought to bear, as I have seen in America, to relieve these great financial institutions of their responsibility to this democratic Commonwealth. I have seen this done so often in America that I am going to oppose leaving it to regulation. I would say leave it to this Parliament, or else retire us, and say that we are simply to register the decrees of theMinistry. </para>

          <para>.- It has often been pointed out in New South Wales that, if we get a uniform Tariff there will be large surpluses there, and certain reductions may then be made in taxation. It seems to be extremely likely that the- people there will look to the reduction of postage as one of the things that ought to be brought about. They will naturally say that, if in Victoria people can have their letters carried for a penny there is no reason why they should not have the same privilege. It seems to me that the power to make this reduction should be given in some way that will enable it to be made without our having to come down to Parliament to ask for it. We can easily understand what would happen to a Government that would exercise this power in a way which Parliament would disapprove of. They would have to go across to the other side of the chamber. If we find in New South Wales, that as the result of the Tariff we have a surplus, we shall have the right to have our postage rates reduced, if we want them reduced. As regards newspapers, we should have an opportunity of putting our newspapers on the same level as those of the other States should the Government think it proper to impose a postage tax on newspapers? I believe I am in a minority,and that few members of the House will agree with me, but I hold the conviction very strongly that the newspapers of New South Wales ought not to be subsidized in the way they have been subsidized in the past. </para>

            <para>- I do not know what the design is. The right honorable gentleman is so used to designs that he suspects some particular design in this case. In New South Wales they expect to have a surplus when the Tariff is passed, and the people will demand that there shall be an alteration made somewhere, so that the burden of taxation may be lessened, and it appears to me that some provision ought to be made under which New South Wales newspapers can be placed on the same footing as the newspapers in other States. We have to bear in mind that in New </para>

              <para>- What we want to ascertain is, who has given the order for the insertion of this advertisement? Was it the Minister of Defence, who has been over in Western Australia recently, with guards of honour attending upon him? Was the order issued by him, or have the military authorities taken it upon themselves? I think this little matter ought to prove a great warning to us, in dealing with the Defence Bill, to be careful as to the authority which we give to these military gentlemen. I think that the Government are to a very large extent responsible for this advertisement, but if they do not consider themselves responsible, I hope they will take the proper course, and deal with the officer who caused it to be inserted in the paper. I thought it was only fair to the House and the country that this matter should be brought forward at once, because the sooner it is dealt with the better. </para>
