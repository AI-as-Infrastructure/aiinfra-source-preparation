                        <para>- I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has received any reports with reference to preliminary railway surveys which have been made between Port Augusta (in South Australia) and the border of Western Australia, and bet ween that border and Kalgoorlie ; and, if so, whether he will lay the documents on the table of the House? </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Minister for Trade and Customs with reference to the allowances to be made on under-proof spirits. The Minister will remember that a promise was made that spirits down to 16-5 degrees under proof now in bond, or shipped before the introduction of the Tariff, would be admitted subject to the allowance for spirits under proof strength made under certain State Tariffs, and that a similar concession would be made with reference to wine containing over 35 per cent. of proof spirit. It is stated from Sydney that these concessions are not yet being made, and I should like to ask the Minister when the promise will be carried out, and also as to how he will act in connexion with the duties that have already been paid upon such goods. </para>

As to the other matters, instructions were given, and I think the honorable member must be in error in imagining that the new practice is not in vogue in Sydney ; but, however that may be, no time will be lost in bringing it into operation. </para>

The Treasurer's estimate was that £708,000 would be received from these sources, but the actual receipts for October were £102,354, or at the rate of about £1,224,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>-That is true ; and, of course, the first few months of the operation of the Tariff will afford no reliable guide. In addition to that, we must recollect that in Western Australia they are still collecting Inter state duties, which were left out of consideration when I made my calculations. Later on, when we have some fair basis on which to work, I shall have an opportunity of considering the whole matter. The revenue received in Western Australia does, however, seem to be coming in more freely than I anticipated. </para>

                        <para>. - I take this opportunity of saying a word or two which might possibly not be in order at another time, but I do not intend to take up the time of the House unnecessarily. I listened carefully to the answers of the Minister for Trade and Customs with regard to the refund of duties. I have said several times before that it seems to me the very worst policy on the part of the Commonwealth is to take the most extreme and harsh view of every possible subject that comes before us as a matter of legislation. In some cases where Bills have been introduced into this House, based upon six different Acts of Parliament which have been in operation in six different States, if there has been an unnecessarily harsh provision in one of these Acts, that provision has been taken as a basis for legislation here. I think it is well understood in most of the States that when a new Tariff is introduced, and the duties first proposed are afterwards altered, refunds shall be given to the person who have paid duty in excess of the amount finally decided upon. That is not merely a matter of grace, but one of sound principle and of justice, and I consider that in the present case the necessity is far stronger than usual upon the Government to refund any excess of duty that may have been paid; because, after all, we are exercising an arbitrary act by the collection of these duties. We are not acting legally in what we are doing. The duties are being collected as an Executive act without the authority of any Bill. There has been no duty imposed by Act of Parliament up to the present time, but by a straining of the Constitution and of our own position as a Parliament, we have agreed that these duties shall be collected as from the date of the Budget speech. The very fact that Ministers have told the people of Australia that they are open to conviction with regard to any particular item in the Tariff, and that probably changes will be made in it, is sufficient evidence that it is anything but perfect. If changes are made, surely, as the </para>

                        <para>- I desire to call the attention of the Minister respecting the Postmaster-General, to one or two matters in connexion with the Sydney Post-office. Acting under the Public Service Regulation Act of 1895, the New South Wales Public Service Board made certain regulations which became operative on 1st July, 1900, and applied to officers in the New South Wales Postal department, who were in receipt of salaries up to £299 a year. These regulations were repealed in December last, and the new regulations abolished the annual increments above £125. When these new regulations were introduced, the increments had not been distributed, the Estimates passing late in the year. These regulations were made retrospective, and the increments which were due to officers in receipt of salaries above £125 annually, were never granted. I would point out that under section 84 of the Constitution, it is clearly laid down that any official retained in the service of the Commonwealth shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights, and shall be entitled to retire from office at the time, and on the pension or retiring allowance which would be permitted by the law of the State as if his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service with the State. I also desire to draw attention to the fact that a distinct act of repudiation has been committed on the part of the Government of New South Wales. The Federal Government has taken advantage of that act of repudiation. I maintain that under section S4 of the Constitution, it is bound by nothing but the equity of the matter, and that no repudiation on the part of a State will cover its own action. It was so clearly an act of repudiation on the part of New South Wales, that a deputation, of the officers concerned waited upon the Attorney-General of that State, who is reported to have informed them that the regulations should not have been made retrospective. Indeed, it has been stated by the New South Wales Government that the Federal Government should make provision for these increments. In the State Estimates, an amount of £1,800 was set down under the department of Justice " to meet increments payable from 1st July to 31st December, 1900, under the Public Service regulations repealed in December, 1900, to officers in receipt of salaries between £150 and £300 per annum." It would appear, therefore, that in the Estimates of the department of Justice provision was actually made for this very purpose. I put a question upon the notice paper last week, and received two replies. One of these was general and evasive, whilst the other was particular and decisive. I was informed, in so many words, that the Government did not intend to pay any increments. I should like to hear from the Ministry some indication of their policy in reference to this matter. If they are going to take advantage of every technical shelter behind which they can crouch, it would appear that the unfortunate men who have been transferred - not through any desire of their own, but by the process of the working out of our Constitution - are to be defrauded of their just rights. This is not a small matter. It involves very large departments. For example, in the New South Wales Post-office alone, there are 5,387 persons employed. That is very much in excess of the number in any two of the States, and nearly 50 per cent, of the officials employed in the post-offices  throughout the Commonwealth ; and of these, a large number are interested in this particular matter. These men have qualified under the regulations of their State for an increase of salary, and it is unreasonable that the State should relieve itself of the necessity of paying this money, and that the Commonwealth, in its turn, should shelter itself behind a wrongful act ; the result being that neither the State nor the Commonwealth will give these unfortunate men their just rights. It is not as if there were any doubt as to the authority or intention of the regulation, which, though it was repealed, was, according to the Attorney-General, wrongly repealed retrospectively. It would appear as if it were open to a Government to issue a new regulation allowing people to think, as an incentive to further exertion, that they were to get increments, and then to retrospectively repeal that regulation and deprive those people of their due. Such a course could not commend itself to any one's sense of fairness and justice. Those most particularly affected are telegraph operators and telegraph masters, who must possess considerable skill. I may say that in New South Wales hundreds of men were weeded out for incompetency by the Public Service Act of 1895, and those who were the very 1 cream of the service were left behind, and told that, having gone through a very cruel ordeal, their reward was to come. The increments were due at the time the regulation was repealed, and now I am astounded to learn that the Federal Government intend to take advantage of that circumstance, and that because the State has repudiated its obligation they propose to follow that vicious example. That is not the way in which to carry on business. If we are to be economical let us be so, but not at the expense of poor men who have unfortunately been defrauded of their just rights. I bring this matter up now, because I should be loath to move the adjournment of the House, and interrupt business. I trust that the subject will receive the attention it deserves, and that these men, if any injustice has been perpetrated, may feel that the Federal Government is no party to that injustice. </para>

                        <para>. - In dealing, first, with the question of refunds, I am not about to follow the honorable member for Wentworth in a discussion of the Tariff at this stage. The honorable member says that the Tariff is anything but perfect; but it may be said of every Tariff that it is anything but perfect. There has never yet been a perfect Tariff, and there never will be until we have one framed by some superhuman intelligence, or perhaps by the Opposition, who sometimes arrogate to themselves that extraordinary quality. The honorable member has said that we are upsetting the whole industrial life of Australia. The imposition of a Tariff causes dislocation and trouble under any circumstances; and in referring to the question of refunds, it seems to me that the honorable member has left out the most important consideration, namely, the consideration of justice. A man may have imported a quantity of goods before the 8th of October and have sold them, charging the duty to the consumer. But supposing a man has imported goods since that date and has sold them, charging the duty to the consumer, by what right can he claim to have that duty returned to him in order that he may twice benefit by it ? </para>

                            <para>- The man who imports contracts with the consumer and makes the latter pay the difference ; and he has no right to a refund of the duty. I grant that there may be difficulty, and some cases of injustice, where a man has imported goods a portion of which have not gone into consumption. There is no doubt that whether there be a refund or not, we may, in some cases, be guilty of unfairness which cannot be avoided. We have to choose between refunding to a man who ought to have nothing, because he has already had the benefit of charging the duty, and, in some cases, leaving a person without remedy who has taken out of bond and paid duty on goods which have not yet passed into consumption. But the importer takes his chance. When he clears goods out of bond he does so as a business man, thinking that the best course to take; and, in many cases, he risks an increase of duty. An importer may take goods out of bond before the Tariff is imposed ; and, as has been done in some cases, may charge the consumer with the duty subsequently imposed, although no duty has been paid. I do not think that the whole of the sympathies of the House are necessarily with the importer. If the importer has put the goods into consumption, which was his object when he took them out of bond, he has charged the consumer with the duty, and it is not fair that in so doing he should have the double advantage. The honorable member for Wentworth has said that to refuse a refund under the circumstances is a new departure. It is no new departure, because it is the practice in both New Zealand and Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- There are some things which people cannot believe until they see the justice of them, and perhaps the honorable member will see the justice of the Government's proposal. The fact that men belong to the legal profession does not disqualify them from grasping the difficulties of the industrial life of Australia. If it were otherwise, the leader of the Opposition would be totally unqualified for his position. Questions of this kind are not to be settled by sneers at the avocations of men. It is not fair to cavil at any honest means by which a man earns his living, whether he be labourer, lawyer, or merchant, and I think the House as a whole is above any quibble of that kind. We have had to choose between two courses, either of which will in certain cases lead to injustice. We have chosen that course which seems to us to lead to the least injustice ; and it must be remembered that we have mo business to play with the revenue. We have no business to give refunds to people in cases where refunds are not deserved. The question is surrounded with difficulties. How can we determine satisfactorily whether a claim for refund is a just one - whether goods have or have not gone into consumption? How can we get at the books of an importer and ascertain what has, been charged, or what is the course of his business ? Is it not the best thing to assume that he has done what he took the goods out of bond to do ? Whether or not he has had the chance of selling the goods, is it not fair to assume that the natural course has been adopted, and therefore to apply the Government proposal? In any case this is a premature discussion, because the sense of the House and the committee must be taken on the point. We have already stated that our proposals will be laid down in the Tariff Bill in such terms that the House will have an opportunity of judging them. More than that, it seems to me that in the course of the progress of the Tariff through committee, it will be necessary to affix dates to such changes as may be made, so that the propriety of what is being done may be determined by honorable members. Full opportunity for consideration will be given to the House, and I take it there is no serious necessity to have a double discussion. As to the other matter, I am very sorry that I cannot speak so fully as the honorable member for West Sydney might desire. I received a note on the subject from an honorable member of the House, but it reached my hands just after one o'clock, when I had very little opportunity of obtaining the necessary information. If the question is raised hereafter, in order that the whole facts may be elicited,. I shall be only too happy to give all the information which the Government can obtain. What has happened has been, so far as I know the circumstances, in the main described by the honorable member for West Sydney. A regulation was issued by the New South Wales Public Service Board, dating back to the 30th of June, reducing an increment of £15, in certain cases, to one of £10, leaving a margin of £5. When the. department was transferred the Commonwealth took it over with the onus of these regulations. </para>

                            <para>- They have; and, though I shall not give a legal opinion, it it may be that part of the retrospective effect is subject to question. But when the department was taken over it was burdened with these regulations, and it will be clear to honorable members that it was not very easy for us to pay increments which the legal authority of the State had determined were not payable. Section 84 of the Constitution would affect the matter, but for the pre-existing state of the law in New South Wales. The Public Service Board were given power to make regulations having the force of law, and these regulations were made. If, with the retrospective effect, the regulations were good - and I will' not say they were not - they come into effect, and the Commonwealth is deprived of the power of doing anything except take the department over in the state in which it stood. There is no desire on the part of the Government to deprive any of these people of their just rights. If we pay these increments they will be chargeable back to the State of New South Wales, and I should be very glad if we got an intimation from the State authorities that they wish the increments to be paid, notwithstanding the regulations of their Public Service Board. If they gave an intimation of that kind, we might take the risk of asking Parliament to vote the increments ; but how can we do so in the absence of such an intimation ? Is it fair or just to single out any State for this purpose, when we may afterwards be met with applications from the other States ? We must act with a great deal of circumspection in regard to a matter of this kind. I shall see the Postmaster-General on the subject, and I may be able to give honorable members fuller information after I have had a discussion with him upon it. The information in my possession now comes to what I have already stated. In September last, the New South Wales Public Service Board issued amended regulations, which do not affect salaries of £150 per annum and over, which are the salaries mostly complained of, though they restore the £15 increment in the case of salaries under and up to £140 per annum. But as the Post-office  department passed over to the Commonwealth before those regulations were made, they could not affect it, so that that adds to the complication and difficulty of the question. As the honorable member has referred to the matter, and as the honorable member for Parramatta has given notice of a question in regard to it, I shall not hesitate to inquire into it again, in order to ascertain if any injustice has been done. It seems to me at present that the Government have acted in necessary conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. If we find that that is not so, and that we are doing something which the Constitution provides shall be done otherwise, we shall not hesitate to retrace our steps, and to tell the House that we are doing so, and why we are doing so ; because I think justice comes before any question of petty pride in a matter of this kind. I cannot, however, undertake to do anything until I hare gone into the whole question again. So far as I have done so, there seems to me be a serious obstacle in the way of doing what the honorable member desires. </para>

Seeing that the Post and Telegraph Act is to come into operation on the first of next month, we might have expected from the Government a declaration of their policy in its administration. We know what its provisions are, but the success of such a measure depends very largely upon the method of its administration, and without some statement from the Premier, members are quite in the dark as to what method will be adopted. There are many subjects in connexion with the Post and Telegraph department which are being keenly considered by the mercantile world and the community generally. One of these is the possibility of revising the telegraph rates. There is very good reason for thinking that the time has arrived when those rates, and particularly the Inter-State rates,. might be recast, now that the divisions between State and State, so far as the administration is concerned, have been removed. Then there are provisions in the Act relating to correspondence forwarded to "Tattersall," a subject which occupied the earnest consideration of this House for some days, and in regard to which we should have had a declaration of the intentions of the Government. But a matter to which I wish particularly to refer is one which affects my constituents very nearly. Although I am an advocate for economy in the administration of the public departments, it seems to me an extraordinary proceeding for the Government to close post-offices in places which have enjoyed the convenience of them for many years, and where they have actually paid for themselves by the business done. In the electorate of South Sydney no fewer than three post-offices are to be closed. When, on the 5th November, I asked the following question upon the subject : - </para>

                        <para>- With regard to the refusal of the Government to make refunds to those who have paid excess of duty, I have no doubt that there is a fair question as to whether, in cases where the consumer cannot obtain the refund, it is desirable for the Government to surrender revenue on the reduction of duties. That is a very open question, and for my part if the Customshouse were to retain only the revenue which cannot be refunded to the consumer, I should be perfectly satisfied. There are, however, very serious cases, in several of the States, in which it seems to me very unjust not to grant refunds. Only in the State of Victoria has it been the custom not to grant refunds. In every other State it has been a recognised principle for many years that refunds should be granted, and under that idea importers have not, as the Prime Minister said, simply duty-paid what they required for delivery; but have had goods taken straight from the ship's side to their own free stores instead of putting them in bond, under the belief that the system hitherto obtaining would be continued, and that if there were a reduction of duty they would be entitled to a refund. I have a letter in my hand showing the effects of the refusal to make refunds. The writer, who is an importer of cocoa, sa3rs : - </para>

                            <para>- Surely there is no likelihood of a further increase where customs duties have already been raised so high, especially in the case of New South Wales. In that State, goods were duty paid only because it was anticipated that the old custom would be adhered to. Then as to the question of entries. I know the difficulties connected with the introduction of a new Tariff, and the trouble which some of the provisions of the Constitution create, but I think that a great deal of unnecessary information is asked for in the entries, manifests, and other documents which have to be prepared for the Customs. In these documents more information is asked for than is either necessary or useful. There is certain information which I believe to be necessary, but the Customs authorities are going beyond this, and seeking information which may be useful, but is not of such value as to justify the authorities in putting business men to the trouble that is involved. If the Minister, in requiring information, is guided by what is absolutely necessary or what is so useful, as to justify the trouble of providing it, he will assist the trading community considerably. I wish also to refer to the matter of the two years' duty. I mean the duty which applies to goods entering a State at a lower rate than the Federal Tariff and passing to another State. I think that too much is being attempted in this connexion. The whole history of the component parts of the smallest article is being sought. For ' instance, in regard to fancy work made by ladies in one State and sent to another, it is necessary to inform the Customs when they were imported, the amount of cotton which they contain, the other materials upon which they are founded, whether each has paid duty and if so how much, and a host of other particulars, although the value of the article itself may be only a trifle. We find that passengers' luggage is still being examined. </para>

                            <para>-I shall be glad to hear that the practice has been discontinued. How is it possible for passengers to say whether any article in their luggage is dutiable or not. Only those articles which have not paid the rates in the Federal Tariff are dutiable. Let us assume that a person goes into a shop in Sydney and purchases a particular article. How does he know whether that article has paid the Federal Tariff? For the matter of that, how does the shopman himself know if he has recently bought from a wholesale house? The whole of the luggage coming from Sydney to Melbourne is being examined, and people are thus put to all sorts of inconvenience without any advantage being derived. I wish also to refer to the question of allowances in respect of goods such as spirits and wine, which were in bond here or had been shipped before the imposition of the duty. The Minister will notice from a telegram which I have received from the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney, that the instructions which he has given have not been carried out. In this connexion, I think that he has good cause to complain </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Treasurer when arrangements will be made to give effect to section 19 of the Victorian Public Service Act .1900, which provides that every transferred officer " shall be entitled to receive a salary equal to the highest salary then payable to an officer of corresponding position in any Australian colony." . This matter has been pending for a considerable time, and was previously brought under the notice of the Treasurer by the honorable member for Yarra. I have frequently been spoken to on the subject by those interested, and, considering that upwards of six months have elapsed since the departments were taken over, it is time effect was given to the section I have quoted. </para>

This hope was held out to these men by the Parliament of Victoria, and the people of Victoria will have to pay the expense ; and I do not think the Federal Government will be able to deprive these officials of the constitutional right which exists. In all probability, when the section of the Victorian Act is brought into operation, it will have to be made retrospective, and the men given back pay. </para>

The only other question to which I desire to refer is that raised by the honorable member for South Sydney, with regard to drawbacks of duty paid on sugar which has been used in making jam for export. Section 168 of the Customs Act makes provision for this matter being dealt with by regulation, so that legislation is not required ; and action ought to be taken as speedily as possible by adopting and promulgating the necessary regulations dealing with the subject. It will be an assistance and encouragement to the fruit-growing industry. The principle has been recognised by the State Governments, and it is only right and proper that effect should be given to it. By doing so, the Minister will, I am sure, give satisfaction to a large number of persons who are interested in a very important industry, and I ask him if he intends to take this action ? </para>

In agricultural and pastoral districts, the changes -which occur in the course of five or ten years are not very great, but a progressive gold-field town creates new requirements every few months. The population of many of the townships of Western Australia, including that of Boulder City, is increasing almost weekly, and their needs increase accordingly. The Post and Telegraph department affords, the people in that part of the Commonwealth almost the only means of testing the advantages of federal administration. If the department is well administered, they are inclined to think well of federation ; but if the administration is bad, it will tend to make federation unpopular. </para>

                            <para>- If the State authorities are responsible, it is well that the matter should be made known so that the fault may rest on the proper shoulders. We have not yet been told whether the Government have appointed a Commandant of the military forces of the Commonwealth. I think that after an interval of six months it is a reasonable thing to ask for a decision on this matter. We have heard many suggestions as to difficulties having been raised by officers to whom the position has been offered, and as to stipulations regarding the appointment of the Commandant's staff. I do not see why there should be any more delay in this matter. Although we have taken over the military forces of the Commonwealth, no controlling head has yet been appointed, and in all probability the extravagance of the past is still going on One of the great inducements held out to us to join the Federal Union was that we should simplify the administration of military matters, and very considerably reduce the expenditure, and every delay in the appointment of the military Commandant must result in injury to the interests of the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister of Defence will recognise the necessity of making an early announcement upon this matter. </para>

The representatives of New South Wales do not forget that the establishment of the federal capital in New South Wales was a part of the bargain under which that State entered the Commonwealth, and it is desirable that decision should be arrived at as early as possible. It might be convenient, perhaps, to arrange for a visit to the suggested sites during the Christmas holidays. I hope the members of the Government will give their fullest attention to the matters I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to emphasize the importance of dealing with the question of drawbacks on colonial manufactured goods that are exported. Certain Customs regulations were gazetted on the 10th October, but no provision was made for dealing with drawbacks in regard to articles in the manufacture of which dutiable goods have been used. My attention has been drawn to the fact that either the Minister for Trade and Customs or some other authority has intimated that no drawback will be allowed on sugar used in the manufacture of jam, at a higher rate than the excise duty on that article. </para>

                            <para>- I am very glad to hear the Minister's denial, because if the intention is to confine the drawback rate to the excise duty, the effect will be very prejudicial in the case of the manufacturers who use imported sugar in the manufacture of articles for export. A considerable trade has been done during the last year or two in the exportation of Australian manufactured goods to South Africa and other places, and it is desirable that drawback should still be allowed to the full extent of the import duty. My attention was directed to the matter, and I wished to know what were the real facts of the case. The honorable member for South Sydney, during the absence of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, referred to the great inconvenience that was likely to be caused to certain parts of his constituency by the closing of post-offices at Darlington and Erskineville. I understand that there is an idea also of closing another post-office at Redfern. I wish to direct special attention to this matter, because it will be a very serious thing to all parts of the country if the Postmaster-General enters upon the course of closing post-offices which are a great convenience to residents of particular localities. I know the districts which have been mentioned very well. They are centres of population which might reasonably expect postal facilities to be afforded them. When making his Budget speech the Treasurer said that if under federation we enormously increase the cost of government, the people will be disposed to regard it as a curse instead of a blessing. But on the other hand, if federation is to curtail postal facilities it is very questionable whether the people will not regard it as a curse in that respect. The excuse offered for the closing of the post-offices mentioned is that they are within a short distance of other post-offices. That is not a sufficient reason for closing them if the volume of trade justifies their existence. We know that in Melbourne and Sydney, within a stone's throw of the General Post-office, there are branch offices which transact a good business, and which no one would dream of closing. A very intimate knowledge of the particular localities affected should be possessed before such an extreme step is taken as that of depriving them of postal facilities. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to attach too much value to the reports of these inspectors. I know that in the suburb of Hurstville an inspector recommended the erection of a post-office, and his recommendation was approved by the State Postmaster-General. All preparations were made for the commencement of the work, but when the Postal department was transferred to the Federal Government, the inspector reported that a post-office was not required in that locality. I fear that a general knowledge of the policy of the person administering the Postal department will, to a large extent, determine the character of the inspector's reports. ' </para>

                            <para>- I do not go to that extent. But if an inspector is aware that his Minister is opposed to granting postal facilities to certain districts, it is easy enough for him to make a report which will harmonize with the ideas of his chief. The closing of these suburban post-offices will result in a loss of revenue to the department. A man will use a post-office if he is within a reasonable distance of it, but will be precluded from using it if it is so far away as to inconvenience him. These matters should be carefully considered, and no curtailment of postal facilities should take place simply because there has been an alteration in the administration of the department. I would further point out that, under the bookkeeping clauses, the States themselves have to bear the expense of maintaining these offices, so that practically the Commonwealth is no better off by effecting such small economies. Unless it be demanded by the States concerned, there is absolutely no reason why this policy of rigid economy should be pursued when it involves interfering with the postal facilities of the people. I should also like to urge that the claims of the officials of the Sydney Post-office to increments should be fully considered by the Treasurer. I feel assured that they have his sympathy. I know that he has not the slightest desire to do an injustice to any officer in the Postal department. If a difficulty has arisen between the States and the Commonwealth, owing to the transfer of the department upon a certain date, I hope that some way will be found to overcome it. </para>

                        SMITH (Macquarie).The thanks of the House are due to the honorable members who raised the question of the capital site. I read the report of a speech by
                        an ex-Premier of Victoria, in Parliament the other day, when he said that, owing to the unsuitability and healthiness of the temporary State Parliament House, there would probably be a serious increase in the death rate amongst honorable members of the local Legislature. I am sure that we have no desire to inconvenience the members of the State Parliament, who have placed this building at our disposal
                        have made a considerable sacrifice in order to meet the requirements of the Federal Parliament. We ought not to accept such a sacrifice, if the result is to be an increased death rate amongst the members of the local Parliament; and something should be done at once to avert such a. result. The Federal Government ought to take prompt steps to enable honorable members to visit the proposed capital sites, and select the most suitable, and. when that is done we can proceed with the erection of temporary buildings, the funds for which there would be no difficulty in securing. I am sure honorable members are prepared to put up with inconvenience so far as temporary buildings are concerned, rather than impose any longer1 than can be avoided on the good nature of the Victorian Legislature. There are, I believe, ten sites suggested, and I do not think it would take long to determine on. the one most suitable. I am pleased the Government intend to take prompt steps to inquire into the grievances of the Post-office officials, because this is a matter which ought to be settled as speedily as possible. As to refunds in connexion with the Tariff,. I a few nights ago suggested, in common! with several other honorable members; a reduction in certain duties, to which I am glad to say the committee and the Government agreed. In some cases the Government have collected duties at an increase of about 350 per cent, over and above the duties, which have been sanctioned by honorable members. I admit that in certain cases it is difficult to find the persons- to whom the refund should be made ; but there are other cases which present no difficulty. I have received a letter from a gentleman in a large way of business in New South Wales, who states- that he has paid a duty of 25 per cent, on three roller mills, in addition to 10 per cent, added by the Customs on the invoiced price. This gentleman states that on inquiry as to refund he was informed that none would be made, and, consequently, he has ordered all the machines to be placed in bond, and kept there pending the settlement of the Tariff. He adds in his letter that, had he known a few months earlier that this iniquitous Tariff was to be imposed, he would have cancelled his order. This machinery, he says, cannot be manufactured in the State. In another case £961 has been paid in duty on machinery, and naturally the people interested are anxious to know whether a refund is to be made, provided the committee see fit to make a reduction in the Tariff. I think it is only right that there should be a refund when a heavy duty like 25 per cent, has been reduced to, say, 15 per cent. The Government are not legally entitled to charge these duties after it has been determined to impose a lower rate. The duties are not charged under an Act of Parliament, but merely at the will of the Executive.

                        <para>- But to sue the Government often means ruin to the man who takes such a step. In the cases to which I have drawn attention, it would be perfectly easy to find the persons to whom the refund is due, seeing that they are two large manufacturing firms in New South Wales. It would be a wrong thing for the Government to refuse to give a refund under such circumstances. One man has placed his machinery in bond because the Customs officials tell him that, even if Parliament reduces the proposed duty, or abolishes it altogether, he will still have to pay the amount set out in the Tariff, and will not be able afterwards to get a refund. The result is that the machinery is lying idle, and his industry is at a stand-still. The gentleman to whom I refer is well known in Sydney, and has expended thousands of pounds in carrying on one of the largest and most important businesses in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know by what authority the Government are charging a duty at all. Even if they had the legal power to levy these duties, is it fair not to give a refund where the duties are afterwards altered by Parliament ? It seems to me that in all cases where the person who has paid the duty can be discovered, and there has been no charging of the duty on to other people, a refund should be made, and that the Government should give notice of their intention to make it. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to this Parliament going to New South Wales to live in a wool-shed, although it may appear heroic to do so. I am satisfied with our present location, and if my friends will help me to raise members' salaries to £750 or £1,000 a year, I shall be prepared to help them to keep Parliament here for some time to come. It is not fair to say that the members of the Victorian Parliament are dying off like rats afflicted with the bubonic plague, because, as a matter of fact, they are well housed, and have all sorts of comforts and luxuries. It would not be fair to the people of Victoria, who have made such great sacrifices on our behalf, not to stay here for a few years, after agreeing to do so. Let us stay here for fifteen or twenty years. In that time we can build a federal capital at Bombala, or some other place, and although we shall, most of us, be dead twenty years hence, the next generation will be able to go there without any sacrifice of comfort. But do not let us sacrifice ourselves on the altar of a wool-shed. Some time ago I asked the Government to erect a light-house at West Point, Tasmania. It seems to me that honorable members are not aware of the importance of the West Coast of Tasmania, where the Mount Lyell and North Lyell mines are. It is- a long distance from Cape Sorell, the last point in Tasmania at which there is a light-house, to the Victorian coast, and, as crowds of people travel backwards and forwards from </para>

I do not complain in the least degree of the grievances which have been brought forward, but I protest strongly against the unnecessary waste of time involved by the extreme length of the statements made in ventilating those grievances. If we make no more progress with the Tariff than we have made to-day, it seems to me that in its consideration twelve months will count for nothing. </para>

                            <para>- But the case would be very different on the Victorian side, if these laws are properly administered, to that of goods imported free of duty in New South Wales. They must be cheaper in New South Wales. It would be to the entire advantage of the persons who have introduced goods' upon the cheapest possible terms into New South Wales to get them into Victoria without payment of the Federal Tariff. The examination must take place for two reasons - first, to prevent a fraudulent advantage being gained by the person who introduces the goods without the payment of duty, and, secondly, for the security of Victoria in the matter of her proper credit for revenue purposes. Here I might remind the honorable member for Wentworth that he rightly put it, as regards the question of bonuses, some time ago, that the Federal Government are undoubtedly the trustees of the people to secure the observance of the provisions of every line and letter of the Constitution in the interests of all. We are doing it. We feel the position acutely. In the matter of bonuses, they may operate to the detriment of Victoria ; and as regards keeping watch and ward over the State boundaries for the purpose of the collection of the duties as provided by the Constitution, it is our province to exercise similar vigilance, even though it may be to the disadvantage of New South Wales. We shall have ample opportunities of discussing any other matters which may require to be further debated, and therefore I do not propose to say any more now. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that we cannot agree to the suggestion which has been made by the honorable member for Wentworth. This item affords one of the most justifiable cases we could possibly have for imposing what has been called a composite duty, and it is the item on which we propose to test the feeling of the committee on the question. It is admitted apparently on all hands that there should be a difference between the duty which is charged on the poorer class of cigar, and the duty charged on the more expensive cigars which are largely imported and probably not made in any of the States. We cannot get away from the fact that it is unjust to charge the same duty on an imported article of small cost as on an imported article of large cost. It is said that with regard to tobacco and tobacco leaf the same principle would apply. </para>

                            <para>- We shall not lose revenue, because on the cheaper kinds of cigars we shall obtain the same duty as we get now, while on the higher priced cigars we shall levy higher duties. It has been said that not many high-priced cigars are imported, but the importation of cigars into Victoria in 1900 was 168,000 lbs., of which 51,000 lbs. were valued at £47,000, or 18s. per lb. On such cigars as those it is quite fair to levy a higher duty than upon cheap cigars. We want to give a market to our own manufacturers for cheap and medium priced cigars, and at the same time we desire to make those who can afford to purchase high-priced cigars pay a little more to the revenue. </para>

I submit to the committee that in this case we can fairly ask for a larger amount of revenue from the higher-priced article. That is admitted by honorable members opposite, because they have suggested that there should be a rate of 7s. or 8s. per lb. on high-priced cigars. </para>

                        McMILLAN (Wentworth). - This case assumes a very serious aspect when the two Ministers in charge of the Tariff say that they intend to take a test vote on the cigar duties. I was surprised to hear the Treasurer justify the principle of composite duties, because I thought the opinion in their favour was entirely confined to his colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs.

                            <para>- It is a bond transaction, and the man who purchases the cigars may keep them in bond. Therefore it is essential that he should be informed by the merchant who sells to him what are the liabilities of the bond. The whole object of bond is to avoid the expense of paying the duty immediately. Otherwise an importer might as well pay the duty in every case and put his importations into a free store. The Treasurer is trying to alter the machinery by which the trade of the country is carried on. He may have great power in his capacity of Treasurer of the Commonwealth, but he has not sufficient power to alter the usages of commercial and industrial life. As far as the Minister for Trade and Customs is concerned, he is impervious to everything except a flutter in two corners of the House. That is the only argument which appeals to him. If he can see that there is danger in a division, his mind at once becomes enlarged. That makes it necessary for honorable members upon this side of the House, instead of uttering a few words and putting the case clearly, to discuss line upon line, and precept upon precept, in order that other honorable members may grasp the position. </para>

                            <para>- To hear some honorable members talk one would think that the importer was a criminal. One would imagine that the port of Melbourne ought to be closed, that there ought to be no trade or commerce in this country, and that every man in it is a rogue. We have as much right to consider the interests of the importers as we have to consider those of the man who carries bricks up the scaffolding of a building. The importer is kept pretty well in his place by the competition of the world. There is no monopoly amongst importers. I submit the amendment, believing that it will be equitable in its incidence, and far better than the proposals of the Government. </para>

We are anxious that the man who can afford to consume expensive cigars shall pay more than does the man who can afford to smoke only much cheaper ones. Honorable members on this side of the House will go further than the Government in that direction. Supposing that the Treasurer imposed a duty of 100 per cent.- </para>

                        B. EDWARDS( South Sydney).I shall support the amendment, but I regret that the honorable member for Wentworth has not made a greater distinction between the two classes of cigars by proposing duties of 6s. and 9s. per lb. The last speaker pointed out that good cigars imported from other parts of the world are frequently labelled " Havana," when they are not Havana cigars ; and no doubt, the amendment if carried would have the effect of putting an end to that fraud to some extent. But, on the other hand, in Hamburg they make good cigars with imported Havana leaf, and label them " Havana," and those cigars would be charged the higher rate. Upon the question of principle, there can be
                        little difference between honorable members in regard to this item. When speaking upon the motion of want of confidence, I pointed out that there were many lines in the Tariff which I considered did not raise the fiscal question, and this is one of them. Honorable members must admit that our revenue must be obtained largely from duties upon narcotics ; and we are, therefore, forced by one of the first canons of taxation to impose duties upon these articles in such a way that they will fall heaviest upon those who are best able to pay them. I look upon cigars as more or less luxuries, and, though it may be difficult to define a luxury, it is evident that a man who can afford to smoke cigars can afford to contribute towards the revenue of the State. Men, too, smoke cigars according to their means , and the committee is, therefore, justified in imposing heavier taxation upon the higher-priced article. The Government propose a specific duty of 5s. 6d. per lb., and an
                        duty of 15 per cent. upon all cigars. If we could collect the
                        duty fairly it is the only duty that we should impose, and 100 per cent.
                        would not be too high a rate ; but it is generally admitted that it is impossible to avoid fraud where
                        duties are charged upon articles of considerable value. But if we wish to avoid the creation of fraud in regard to the importation of cigars, we should abolish the 15 percent, duty. If we can, by a specific duty, obtain as much revenue as by the proposals of the Government, and make a distinction between the quality of the cigars imported, without giving opportunities for fraud, we should do so. It has been pointed out that one of the difficulties in connexion with the imposition of an
                        duty is that cigars are dealt in largely in bond, and that where
                        duties are imposed, the importers' cost is disclosed to the purchaser. The suggestion of the honorable member for Gippsland shows that he knows very little about the way in which these things are managed. I do not know that any Customs department has ever allowed the piecemeal payment of duty. Goods are either bond or free, and, in my opinion, it would be almost impossible for a collector to have in bond goods upon which the
                        but not the specific, duty had been paid, and goods wholly dutiable. I am sure that if the amendment is adopted the taxation will be more evenly divided, and the Government will get a larger revenue, while those who want protection will obtain all that they desire.

                            <para>- They must bo branded as Havana cigars if they are to be sold as such in this market. If any fraud were perpetrated in that way, it could be very easily detected. The Trades Marks Acts of the various States, and even of the exporting countries, would to some extent protect the revenue against possible fraud by the importation of cigars under a false name. We ought to diminish the difference between the excise duty and the duty on imported leaf combined, and the duty on imported cigars, so as not to afford an undue amount of protection to the local cigarmaker. The New South Wales Cigarmakers have managed very well, with only a difference of 2s. 6d. per lb. between the locally manufactured and the imported article. </para>

                            <para>- There were two. I have seen a statement by an authority that I am not likely to disregard, that two large firms started operations last year, and that one, a German company, brought out 60 men, under contract, to work in their factories, It would be an extraordinary thing if these factories were started in anticipation of a high duty, because since the duties were declared, the Tobacconists' Association of Victoria has complained that the duties are not high enough. In fact, they stated that they were going to change the shape of some of their goods, because they were rather disgusted at the inadequate protection afforded by the Tariff. I think a difference of 2s. 6d. between the imported and the locally-manufactured article would be quite sufficient. That may be brought about by making the total duty on the locally manufactured cigars 4s. per lb., and the duty on the imported cigars 6s. 6d. per lb., or by fixing the import duty at 6s., and the duty on the locally-manufactured cigars at 3s. 6d. per lb. A considerable amount of revenue would be obtained by making a change in this way. If the duties arc fixed at 4s. and 6s. 6d., which I believe the honorable member for Wentworth is aiming at, additional revenue will be produced to the extent of £32,000. Whereas, if the duties are fixed at 6s. and 3s. 6d. the addition to the revenue will be something like £22,000. </para>

                            <para>- Free-traders recognise that Australia cannot at once be broken off from the vice of protection. We must remember that the producers of cigars are to a great extent also manufacturers of cigarettes and tobacco. I do not suppose that all the trades are carried on in the one factory, but they are to a large extent combined The protection afforded to all departments of the trade is considerable, and the profits made are enormous, and I do think that we should discontinue the extraordinary advantage that these manufacturers have hitherto enjoyed. In New South Wales, with a difference of 2s. 6d. per lb., they got on very well, whilst in Victoria, with a difference of 4s. 3d. per lb., they did not get on particularly well. My desire is to reduce the difference to 2s. 6d., and in the meantime I shall support the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Wentworth </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member who has just resumed his seat stated that the cigarmakers of New South Wales had got on very well with a margin of 2s. 6d. between the import duty and the duties charged upon locally-manufactured cigars. The statistics for 1899 show that in New South Wales there were manufactured 6,250 lbs. of cigars, whilst they imported 268,293 lbs. In other words, out of every 42 cigars that were smoked in New South Wales, 41 were imported. At the end of 1899, when there was an alteration in the excise from 2s. 6d. to 9d. per lb., and thus the margin between the imported and the locally-manufactured article was increased to 4s. 3d., the local manufacture of cigars went up from 6, 250 lbs. to 50,168 lbs. One German importer, who had been introducing a particular brand of cigars very largely, brought out 50 workmen from Germany and manufactured the cigars in bond until the reduction of the excise duty took place, and then the cigars were brought on to the market. In New South Wales in 1899 they imported 21,546,000 cigars. More than half that number was from the Philippine Islands, and the average price per thousand of the Manilla cigars was 38s. 2d. The working men of New South Wales, who are the largest consumers of these cigars, had to pay a duty equivalent to 220 per cent. Now the average price per thousand of the higher-class- cigars is £13, so that the rich man only had to pay duty equivalent to 33 per cent, on the value of the article. I hope that the proposals of the Government will go a long way towards correcting this manifestly unfair distribution of taxation. In Victoria where we had a margin of 4s. 3d., there were 84,407 lbs. manufactured in 1899, and 127,350 lbs. imported: so that out of every five cigars smoked in Victoria three were imported. It stands to reason, therefore, that with a smaller margin it would be absolutely impossible to hold the trade together. Honorable members who have travelled through the East, know that one can get cigars there for next to nothing. I have bought them in Colombo for lOd. per 100. The leaf used in them is not well cured, but one can get an excellent cigar for 2s. 6d. per 100. The reason for this is that the wages in India are about 6d. per day, whereas in New South Wales and Victoria the cigarmakers receive 40s. per 1000 for their manufacture, Nearly every honorable member in this House professes to be in favour of a white Australia. I utterly fail to understand how some honorable members, who make this profession, and who voted for the exclusion of the black man from our shores, can consistently allow the products of his labour to compete with that of our own people. I am convinced that the margin which we had in Victoria, and which formerly operated in New South Wales, was not sufficient to allow the local manufacturers to produce more than half the cigars consumed in Australia. If we have a smaller margin the trade will be utterly wiped out. In Victoria we have a scale of wages fixed under the wages boards provisions of the Factories Act, which ensures to the worker better conditions than he has had before. But if the margin which has operated hitherto is reduced the wages will certainly go down. In New South Wales, we have been informed, there are two large manufactories. There arc only 70 persons employed in the cigar making industry in that State at the present time. In Victoria there are 300 thus employed. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer will reconsider this matter, which is one of great importance, because if they persist in their proposal they will find the revenue much smaller -than they anticipate. Western Australia in the year 1900 received cigars from the following places : - The United States, 6,715 lbs.; Victoria, 8,715 lbs.; South Australia, 8,606 lbs.; New South Wales, 12,328 lbs.; Singapore, 16,080 lbs.; India, 232 lbs.; Hong Kong, 74 lbs.; Germany, 8,770 lbs.; France, 2,023 lbs.; Belgium, 3,670 lbs.; Sweden, 140 lbs.; the Philippines, 351 lbs.; and Holland, 209 lbs. It would be impossible for any one, even an expert, to tell the value of all these brands of cigars. It will be seen from the figures that the quantity produced in the Australian States and imported into Western Australia was 9,081 lbs. During the last two or three years, three or four tobacco and cigar manufacturers had started business in Western Australia, and, producing a very good article, are extending their operations. So far as Western Australia is concerned, the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth is much to be preferred to that of the Government. I know from importing cigars myself that the average invoice from Singapore is from £2 to £3 per 1,000, at 12 lbs. weight to the 1,000. A consignment of 1,000 Singapore cigars invoiced at £3 per 1,000, 12 lbs. weight, with a duty of 7s. would pay £4 4s. in duty. The proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth would exact still more, whereas under the Government proposal the cigars would pay only £3 15s. I look on the duty on cigars as I do on the duty on spirits and similar articles, namely, as purely a means of raising revenue, and as having nothing whatever to do with free-trade or protection. While there may be a large amount of protection incidentally, what we have to consider is that this is a source from which we must derive as much revenue as possible. I feel compelled to support the amendment of the honorable member for Wentworth. </para>

                        WILLIS (Robertson).There seems to be no principle involved in this question, but merely a matter of expediency. The principle here involved we shall also have to discuss when we consider the excise duty. It would be well on the part of the Government to consider the proposal of the honorable member for Wentworth with a view of offering a compromise. I am not at all opposed to the Government in this matter, but merely desirous of doing what is best for raising revenue in the interests of the several States. The waste of time arises from the fact that the Government look on suggestions or proposals from the opposition side with a certain amount of suspicion. During the last month it has been the experience of merchants that composite duties, and especially
                        duties, lend themselves to fraud, and we are as desirous as is the Minister to protect the Commonwealth against fraud. It is quite possible for unscrupulous persons to produce invoices showing that their goods are of much lower value than their actual value, so that they may evade the payment of high duties upon them. If the Minister were to accept as a compromise duties of 6s. and 8s. per lb.-

                            <para>- I suppose that the honorable member for Wentworth is still smarting under the very proper rebuke administered to him this evening. I trust it will be for his political good in the future. If the honorable member could only see himself now, and note the difference between his present demeanour and that which he was exhibiting when he was talking just now, in a manner so utterly unfitting the occasion, and so utterly unbecoming, he would register a resolve never to so offend again. I am sorry that I found it necessary to speak to him as I have done to-night, but the necessity was patent to all fair-minded people, and I trust that his future behaviour will show that he has heeded what has been said to him. A great deal has been said on the subject of drawbacks on the export of cigars. Now, let me tell those honorable members who have so eloquently addressed themselves to the subject of this drawback on cigars, and the inconvenience which will result if the Government proposals are carried, that as a matter of fact there is no drawback on cigars. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the fact of the Treasurer coming so closely into contact with his colleague will not cause him to surrender the reputation of a life-time. I can guarantee that this debate would have been finished ere this if it had not been for the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Even now I advise that the debate should not be prolonged very much. Although the Minister for Trade and Customs has imported an amount of unnecessary heat into this debate, and has delivered a speech which does not reflect credit upon a member of the Government, I do not think that, in the interests of the public business, we ought really to take any notice of his volcanic eruption. </para>

                        (North Sydney).- I merely wish to point out that the Minister for Trade and Customs is defeating any effort which could be made by honorable members upon this side of the House to prevent the discussion being unduly prolonged. The right honorable gentleman has just made a speech which - if he had any right to make it - should have been made in reply to objectionable remarks by specific members of the Opposition. But he includes in his attack every honorable member sitting upon this side of the chamber, some of whom have been silent and others of whom are very careful not to impute improper motives, and not to call the Minister or his supporters " manufacturers' agents." If the Minister has a proper right to object to the remarks of any individual member of the Opposition let him single out the member and make his reply. But if he is going to attack the Opposition and call them " agents for importers "--

Then the Minister proceeds upon the very easy task - one wonders why he makes it so difficult - of putting up arguments as having emanated from this side of the House, which were not used, and then knocking them down. What did the Minister for Trade and Customs say ? He said that every honorable member of the Opposition who had spoken had stated that there was a </para>

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Very alarming state of things. Despite the Minister's bold talk, we know that on the lower-priced cigars these composite duties will amount to between 100 and 110 per cent., while they will amount only to something like 40 per cent. on the higher-priced article. These facts simply show the ignorance of the right honorable gentleman in regard to the Tariff, which perhaps some outsider framed for him. But there is still another important question in relation to the matter, and one which has not been considered at all. The honorable member for Yarra and other honorable members have said that these duties must be preserved, because of the protection which they give to the cigar-workers, but if the whole of the cigars used in the Commonwealth were subject to the import duty, and no cigars were locally manufactured, the revenue of the Commonwealth would benefit to the extent of £97,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member must admit that during the time that New South Wales had a difference of only 2s. 6d. in favour of the local manufacturer she produced practically no cigars. Already a considerable amount of distress has occurred in Victoria and South Australia on account of the operation of this duty, and I think that a rate of 5s. 6d. per lb. is scarcely enough. </para>

                        <para>- It is assumed by some that if an honorable member supports an increased duty upon any item, he holds a brief for the manufacturer. So far as I am concerned that is wrong. The only brief which I hold is one for the worker. Throughout Victoria there are a number of small £5-licence men who manufacture cigars. Their establishments prevent monopolies being built up by the big manufacturers, and I am anxious to see them considered. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that we should be asked to give local manufacturers more protection than can be justified by the figures supplied by the cigar workers themselves. It has been stated that the reason for the imposition of a protective duty is to be found in the difference between the wages paid here and those paid in the countries from which cigars are imported. According to the importers' statement, a 3d. cigar costs 60s. per 1,000 abroad, while the workers say that it costs 40s. per 1,0.0.0. I take the duty upon the higher estimate, which is no doubt the extreme cost. That amounts to £3 18s. 7d., though the manufacturer says the duty is only £3 12s. 7d. </para>

                            <para>- That was a temporary measure adopted in New South Wales for the reason that the Federal Constitution had omitted to make the same provision with regard to excise, as is made in regard to Customs, namely, that goods when passing to another State shall be chargeable with the difference between the duty that has been paid and the higher federal duty. Had the New South Wales Parliament not arranged to meet the circumstances by empowering the Government to create the lower Victorian rates by proclamation, the Victorian manufacturers, who had paid the lower excise, would immediately after the imposition of the higher federal excise, have passed their goods into New South Wales and taken the trade. </para>

                            <para>- No, though the manufacturers of New South Wales, anticipating that the federal excise would be higher, worked hard, as did the manufacturers of Victoria, in order to get in as big a stock as possible duty-paid. It seems to me that the Government rates, as they are, without the sixpence increase, cover the whole cost of labour within 2s. per thousand, even shading the figures in favour of the manufacturer ; and I think, therefore, that the proposal of the Government is quite liberal enough. </para>

When the strong course is forced on the Chairman of naming an honorable member, there is yet time for thought. The honorable member for Werriwa, who left the chamber, has returned and resumed his seat ; and I think honorable members will be at one in the hope that he will withdraw from the position he has taken up, so that the business may go on. I am quite sure that neither the honorable gentleman nor the Chamber will lose in dignity if he acts on my suggestion. </para>

We have increased not only the duty on the leaf by 6d., but also the excise in Victoria by 9d. In South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia, where there was no excise, we put on a duty of1s. 6d. On the whole, I think, to settle the matter, we might fairly agree to make it 6s. 3d. instead of 6s. 6d. as proposed by my honorable friend. </para>

                        <para>- I dissent from the amount of protection which is afforded to two or three favoured individuals. The community generally could afford to give every one of these men an income of £100 a year to sit down and do nothing, and yet be very considerably in pocket by it. If the imported article were consumed we could wipe out this industry, and yet save a considerable amount of money by it. It seems to me that argument on a point like this is entirely lost upon many honorable members on the opposite side. Therefore I shall not continue the discussion after having been defeated on the two former items. </para>

Division III. is of a different character from that which we have been considering, and as a matter of courtesy from the Government to this side, I ask that we should now adjourn, so that we may have an opportunity of considering the next lot of items.

                            <para>- There is no doubt that the public and the commercial world are waiting with great anxiety for this Tariff to be finally determined. We have been considering it for days, and have practically done nothing. There are a large number of items to come, upon which there is sure to be a good deal of discussion, especially with regard to the protective items. If we are only to make the progress which we have been making, it will be months before we finish the Tariff. I have no desire to curtail discussion, but I do say that the debate which has taken place with regard to the items just dealt with has been too prolonged altogether. </para>

                        <para>- As to the suggestion for an adjournment, there is a great deal to be said as to the necessity of getting the Tariff through as soon as possible. So far as I am concerned, I have no desire to be kept here until the middle of next winter. The commercial community will not be inclined to thank any one who takes any action in the direction of delay. Reasonable discussion every one desires to see, because we may make mistakes if that does not take place ; but as far as possible we should push things along. I suggest to the Treasurer, however, that the matter of the sugar duties, with which glucose is connected, is one upon which the committee should not come to a hasty decision. It would appear that the fate of a measure upon which these sugar duties absolutely depend is trembling in the balance in another place. I should be inclined to vote for a very much lower duty on. sugar were it. not for helping the planters in the north, to get over the interim period during which we ask them to dispense with kanaka labour. Therefore, I think there is a consensus of opinion in the committee in favour of keeping these items in hand. The sugar duties should be considered from the point of view of the measure to which I have alluded. Honorable members on the Opposition side have generously waived their opinions on the general question of the sugar duties, in order to help those engaged in this industry through a trying period; but the point of view will be altogether altered if the terms and conditions upon which the sacrifice is being made are not observed by all parties. It would be a mistake for us to determine these duties until we see that other people are willing to bear their fair share. I ask the Government to postpone the sugar duties until we know what is to be the upshot of the labour legislation upon which we have been engaged. I do not ask them to hold over the sugar duties with the intention of going back upon the bargain, because I believe all members of this House will pledge themselves loyally to abide by the sugar duties if the other part of the compact is carried, through. I know that, so far as concerns the party with which I am associated, we. would not for a moment think of going back at a later stage upon this bargain, so long: as other matters are dealt with in the way the House of Representatives has dealt with them. For these reasons, I suggest to the </para>

If, however, the honorable gentleman wishes to convey by his speech that we are to come here only to deal with One item in the Tariff each day, I think he has taken an entirely erroneous view. The fact that we are to come here at half-past ten to-morrow does not weigh with me. There are a very large number of people in the Commonwealth who have to work much longer hours, under greater difficulties, and for a great deal less, than they are paying us. Any honorable member who feels seriously aggrieved at being kept here so late has an easy remedy at hand. The government of the country would go on if the greater number of the members of this committee were to resign to-morrow, and perhaps better men would get in to do the country's work. I say it is the duty of the Government now to see that the House sits the number of days necessary to get this Tariff through, as we are paid to give the whole of our time to our parliamentary duties. If the Government intend to carry on the business more expeditiously, the line of least resistance will be followed by sitting on all the legal days of the week, and intimating to the electors of the Commonwealth politely and fearlessly that we find it necessary to extend the hours and days of sitting, owing to the desire of honorable members to talk upon every conceivable and inconceivable subject.'

I know of no honorable member who needs, a lecture more than the honorable member for Parramatta. While other members have an opportunity of going backwards and forwards to their homes, members representing Queensland and Western Australia have to remain here all the time, and I suggest to the Government that they should support the proposal that we should sit all the legal days of the week while we are here. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to support the suggestion of the last speaker. I think it is now time that we took it in hand to get through the work. I should like to point out to the leader of the Opposition, when he says that we have done very well to-day, that we were at the items which have been finally passed to-night on this day last week. I do not wish" to refer to members speaking long enough. They have been declaring that they have the right to speak, and I admit it, but I think it should be exercised with a little more consideration for the wishes of other people. Let me remind honorable members that the exercise of the right in that way has brought about in other Legislatures certain regulations which, I hope, will never be introduced here ; but members of those Legislatures have had to adopt those regulations in selfdefence. </para>

If I could do the same, I should be quite content to sit here all the year round. As it is, I may get home in the middle of the night, and if this goes on much longer the youngsters when they get up in the morning will want to know what man is in bed with their mother. When we were on the hustings we did not say we were not going to be paid well enough for the position. As the honorable member for Wide Bay remarks, if any honorable member is not satisfied, there is an easy way out of the difficulty. There are hundreds of aspirants for a seat in the Federal Parliament. I am glad to see that the Government have set up their backs for once. Let us sit on Fridays as on other days. As it is, some honorable members go away to their homes On Thursdays and Fridays, and come back on Tuesdays as fresh as new paint. It has been the custom of the Government to concede an early adjournment on Tuesday evening, because some honorable members have been . travelling in the train, and have had their nerves shaken. What about our nerves ? </para>

                        COOK (Parramatta).- We ought to be delighted with all this lecturing. When lectures are not being delivered we have reflections like that made by the honorable member for Melbourne, who characterized the talk of honorable members as twaddle. I presume everything is twaddle that does not commend itself to his mind. We are not here to suit the aesthetic tastes which that honorable member possesses. He might extend his knightly courtesy, and refrain from making these discourteous interjections. It does not comport with his position and high tone to be doing so. I for one resent his offensive interjections. The honorable member adopts a tone as though he were miles above every one else in the House. I beg to assure him he is not. We were sent here not to do what the Government propose, but to resist their proposals by every legitimate means in our power.

So far as attending to our parliamentary duties is concerned, I work three hours for every one that he does, and the honorable member is not within bounds in attempting to lecture me in regard to the discharge of my parliamentry duties. I do not pretend to say I am not paid for what I do. I can point to my career, and compare it with the honorable member's, either in this or in any other Parliament, in point of attendance and the discharge of my duty. When he beats me in point of attendance and earnestness in his parliamentary work, it will be time enough for him to lecture me. I think we are entitled to ask the Government to give us this adjournment. </para>

                            <para>- I have said nothing of the kind. We are going to fight these duties according to the rules of the House. There has been no obstruction, but honorable members on this side of the Chamber realize that it is not their duty to accept the Tariff without making a very strong effort to modify the Government proposals. A reasonable amount of expedition has been shown in the consideration of the Tariff, and there is no justification for the impatience that is now being exhibited by the Government. </para>

                        McEACHARN (Melbourne). - I am very sorry to have to rise to take part in a debate of this character. I appear to have brought down upon myself the spleen of the honorable member for Parramatta, because I said there had been a good deal of twaddle talked. The honorable member has now given us a sample of what he can do in that respect.

I can assure honorable members that I cordially appreciate the altered tone of the leader of the Opposition, and I shall strive to modify mine accordingly. Nothing would give me greater delight than to assent to any request that he might make ; but this is not a matter of personal consideration or liking, and it is not even a question of party strife that we could fight out and put an end to. It is a question of the dignity of Parliament, and whether we shall have the right to stand high in the public estimation. If we continue in our present course we shall forfeit that right. The duty of the Government, not only to themselves, but to honorable members on both sides of the House, is clear, and that is to go on with the business and show that we appreciate our duty to the public, and that we are setting our minds fearlessly to the discharge of that duty. </para>

                            <para>- There has not been any excessive waste of time over the details of the Tariff. The Government themselves interrupted the debate upon it during the present week by introducing a proposal that the Commonwealth should take over the administration of New Guinea, and a whole evening was absorbed in that discussion. I do not anticipate for a moment that we shall not be able to dispose of the Tariff before the Christmas adjournment. As far as it is possible, after reasonable debate has been allowed upon the items, the Government will find the Opposition co-operating with them in an endeavour to expedite the transaction of business. </para>

He offered to pair myself, and was . very anxious that I should leave the House. I am perfectly satisfied that between the whip and myself the understanding was that there was not to be a long sitting. Several honorable members paired under that impression. Had there been any idea that we should continue sitting after half-past eleven o'clock, or midnight, I should have requested them not to leave the precincts of the House. There has been no intimation given that the Ministry intended to unduly prolong the sitting.

                            <para>- The Prime Minister said nothing definite at all. I took it for granted that he meant we should not sit later than twelve o'clock. If the Government intended to sit till one a.m. or two a.m., there ought to have been some official intimation of the fact given to honorable members. Instead of there being any justification for the charges which have been levelled against myself and others during this discussion, I have specially requested honorable members upon this side of the House to refrain from discussing items. I stopped the discussion upon the cigarette question, which might have occupied a very long time. However, I do not care now what is done. If there is an adjournment at this stage, I have nothing to thank Ministers for, but I have to thank honorable members upon the cross benches. The Government are treating us very unfairly and discourteously. </para>

                        (Werriwa). - I regret very much that the Government should have persisted in continuing the debate to-night. Personally, I induced several honorable members not to speak upon two or three items, and to that extent I consider the Government are indebted to me. If the Ministry have allowed an impression to go forth that there would be an adjournment at midnight, they have committed a serious breach of faith. I spoke to the Ministerial whip about this matter, and he assures me that I misunderstood him. I am therefore bound to accept his explanation. Had I not misunderstood him, we should have been discussing some of the items still. Upon one line I saw that the Ministry had consented to raise the duties to the extent of 9d. per lb., thus putting another £15,000 or £20,000 annually into the pockets of certain manufacturers. In deference, however, to a request from the Government whip, and to a further request from the acting leader of the Opposition, I waived my right to speak upon that item. On a question like this a great deal of information is required, and a settlement cannot be arrived at without some discussion. At the instance of the acting leader of the Opposition several of us curtailed our remarks on the last two or three subjects, on the understanding that the Ministry would consent to an adjournment ; and even if a mistake has been made in this connexion, the Ministry would be only acting honorably in consenting to bring the sitting to a close. Queensland members have referred to what they call a "paid House," but I do not consider that such a description applies to honorable members who give their time as we do to the work of legislation.

The Ministry, in the first instance, without consulting the committee or the Opposition, accepted the mandate - because I can call it nothing less - of an honorable member in charge of the party on the cross benches. Then at a late hour of the night, when it was understood by most honorable members that we were not going beyond the tobacco duties, the Ministry proposed to postpone an intermediate division, and ask honorable members to consider subsequent duties. The Ministry ought to have given honorable members a clear intimation of their intention ; and their treatment of the House is unfair and unprecedented.

                            <para>- It is so, and it has occurred on many occasions, though I said nothing, because I thought silence was the dignified course to take. I have always recognised the labour party, although I deplore a third party in any deliberative assembly. But we are His Majesty's Opposition, and representative government, as we understand it in the British dominions, cannot be carried on unless there is a properly organized Opposition to criticise the Ministerial proposals. When the history of this session is reviewed, it will be seen that members of. the Opposition have consistently assisted the Government in all non-party measures. I have done so in connexion with every one of the machinery Bills ; and on my word of honour I can say that during the consideration of those measures I never submitted a motion of a party character. It is not fair, after we have sat here from half-past two o'clock, and when we have to meet at half-past ten o'clock to-morrow morning, for the Government to refuse the courteous request which I make on behalf of the Opposition. No honorable member on- the Government side of the House can say that it was understood that the House was to continue to . sit until the small hours. With a great deal of pain I have to say of my right honorable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs - for he is a friend of mine whom I esteem sincerely - that he very often mistakes a sort of stubbornness, the result, perhaps, of a little temper, for that determination and firmness which is quite right under proper circumstances. But I want to let the past be buried, and merely to say that I am certain no real business will be done, for the simple reason that we are not prepared to do it. Personally I have been over weighted with work during the last week or two, as no doubt have other honorable members, for there is not an item of the Tariff ou which we have not been inundated with literature and correspondence. In New South Wales the Tariff has not been a very prominent, question on account of its simplicity. I confess that as to a large number of these items I am absolutely ignorant. There may be honorable members on this side who understand some of this business better than I do. I am doing my best to understand the representations that have been made. I have papers relating to the items, and wish to consult with one or two of my honorable friends on this side on one or two of them. I do not understand several of them sufficiently to debate them to-night. I do npt think the Minister for Home Affairs will disbelieve my statement. If I were prepared to go on, even if we had to sit all night, I should not object, but I am not prepared to deal with these items, because I did not think that there was any chance of them being brought forward to-night. </para>

                        (North Sydney).- I have no objection to the committee sitting all night and all to-morrow, but is it quite fair to proceed in the absence of honorable members, to whom some of these items are of importance, who have gone away, not knowing that the sugar duties would be postponed, and not anticipating that there would be a late sitting
                        I am quite with the Ministry in their desire to get the Tariff through this House before Christmas. If there is any likelihood of its consideration being prolonged beyond that date, we should have all-night sittings to carry it through by then. I admit that sometimes a Government can get on more quickly with all-night sittings than with all-day sittings, but in fairness to honorable members or constituents who are particularly interested in certain items the members ought to have an opportunity of knowing that the business is going on beyond the usual hour before that step is taken. It will be only fair for the Ministry, if they find it necessary, to have all night sittings on days other than Thursday, as we have a day sitting on Friday. Let the Ministry ask the committee to sit for three or four days if they like, day and night, but let their intention be announced beforehand. It is not so near Christmas time that they need have continuous sittings yet. If they require to have all-night sittings let them name the nights, so that honorable members may come prepared.

                        <para>- The acting leader of the Opposition ventured the assertion that honorable members on this side did not anticipate that we were going to sit late to-night, but we anticipated sitting late last night. We have held our tongues here for the last fortnight, scarcely any honorable members have spoken, and we are simply ashamed at the slow progress of business. The honorable member for Wentworth said yesterday that he intended to debate the Tariff line by line, and I took the statement of the Prime Minister that the Government would take such steps as to insure progress as an intimation that they would sit late to-night, and I believe that most of the members on this side took it in that light. It is the duty of honorable members to know the position of business before they leave. We are twitted by the press which supports the Opposition with the slow progress of business, and if we do not push on now honorable members on the other side, as well as their press advocates, will twit the Government with the slow progress we are making. I trust that we shall sit on to-night and do business, and sit on, as the honorable member for North Sydney has fairly said, so that we can get the Tariff put through by Christmas . The honorable member for North Sydney, and, the honorable member for Wentworth, have been fair and manly all through ; but I do not think they are acting fairly to the country, or to the commercial community, by assisting to delay the consideration of these items. The honorable member for Wentworth said that he did not know of any House ever sitting late at night on the revision of a Tariff. I have assisted in the revision of three Tariffs, and we never got them through without sitting late and early. </para>

                        McMILLAN (Wentworth). - The honorable member for Echuca says that a number of honorable members on the other side have not spoken in this debate, or have taken up very little time. Honorable members who helped to frame this Tariff with the highest rates, can well afford to sit close and tight, and look on. But our duty has been to protest against the Tariff, and to debate it honestly in the interests of the country. The Government whip in the earlier part of the evening was engaged in arranging pairs for honorable members, and the inference to be drawn from that fact was that the Government did not intend that the committee should sit late. It was generally understood that as soon as the tobacco duties were disposed of there would be an adjournment.

                            <para>- I am sorry that the acting leader of the Opposition thinks that the Government have not shown consideration to honorable members on that side. On other occasions when we have allowed an adjournment it simply meant that the speeches delivered the night before were repeated next day. But we want to deal with the matter in as friendly a spirit as possible whilst at the same time we have a duty to the people. The mercantile community are in a state of confusion, because they do not know what bargains to make and what contracts to enter into. There is no doubt that we have not made the progress with the work that ought to have been made. I understand that the acting leader of the Opposition now states that he is prepared to assist the Government to carry this Tariff through before the adjournment for the Christmas holidays, and I think he has sufficient influence with his supporters to have that promise carried out. There are three items in the next division which we might deal with before we adjourn, namely, animals, arrowroot, and bacon and hams. I do not think there is any necessity for much discussion on them. </para>

We are anxious to complete the consideration of the Tariff by Christmas, and I am willing to sit extra days to get it through. I am willing also to say that while, owing to the action of the Government, it will be necessary for us probably to debate the Tariff at greater length than might be the case under other circumstances, we will not countenance any obstruction. We will debate every item if necessary, and we will not allow any restriction upon our liberties in debate, but so far as I am personally concerned, in my position of acting leader of the Opposition, I shall not countenance anything like an endless repetition of arguments or obstructive tactics.

                        <para>. - I have every desire to accept the statement of my honorable friend, the member for Wentworth, in good faith. Am I to understand that we shall be assisted in getting the Tariff through this House before the Christmas adjournment, and that the intention to debate every item does not mean that each item is to be debated as of course, but only if, as between man and man, there appears to be good reason for debating it? That has not been the position so far, and if the position in the future is to be assimilated to that in the past, I can have no faith in any assurances whatever. I have no desire to cast any doubt at all on what the honorable member for Wentworth has said, but I should like to know whether he believes that the course he has indicated will be followed by the Opposition as a body ? I am prepared to accept any assurance that is given to me by the honorable gentleman. I ask upon no question of personal honour at all, because I take every man's word as his bond. But I wish to know if the statement that every item is going to be debated is to mean that there is going to be a debate of the length we have had on the other items ; and if the course indicated by my honorable friend is, in his judgment, a course which the Opposition will follow. I ask because, unless these promises are involved in a reasonable way in the statement that the honorable gentleman has made, we can have no hope of getting the Tariff through before Christmas. I have no wish to drive or to push honorable members too far, but I should like to get from my honorable friend some intimation of his opinion upon the points I have raised. </para>

                        McMILLAN (Wentworth). - My right honorable friend has gone, in this matter, a little too far. According to parliamentary usage, the Government side of the House is, as a rule, better organized in a certain way than the Opposition, and it is the custom, when certain serious business is to be got through within a certain period, to have some understanding between both sides. I think that is reasonable. My position in the matter, as acting leader of the Opposition, is a little more difficult than if I were leader. When the right honorable gentleman asks for my assurances in the matter, all I can say, in general terms, is that every one on this side of the committee, so far as I know, is anxious to see the Tariff put through by Christmas if that is at all possible. After all, in dealing with the Tariff, we are in a peculiar position, because, although in a minority, we represent the free-traders of Australia, and it is absolutely necessary, owing to the way in which the Tariff is framed, that where any principle or any item that requires consideration is involved, we must have the right to debate it fairly. So far as I can see every item will have to be more or less debated, and we must have the liberty of debating every item fairly.

While giving this assurance as far as I can for honorable members on this side of the House - and I suppose that I have some influence with them - I would ask in all good fellowship, not in any humble way, but as a matter of right, that His Majesty's Opposition should be treated with more consideration than we have received during this session. I think it is a fair thing that before changes are made by the Government, before any decision is arrived at at the instigation of any honorable member or any party in the House, we should be consulted. Action has been taken on several occasions at the instigation of some honorable member without the slightest references being made to the Opposition. </para>

That will be my unfailing desire as long as I am a member of this Parliament. I can give a general assurance to my right honorable friend, that our desire is, if it be possible, to close this debate by Christmas, so that the Tariff may be handed over at that time to the other Chamber, which will thus be given full time to consider what action it will take. There will be no obstructive tactics on our part. At the same time we cannot make any hard and fast compact which would in any way limit our right of discussion to the fullest extent on every item. </para>

It is impossible for either of us to fully control every member of our own party, but assuming that every reasonable regard is paid to that which the honorable member has said, I shall entertain the hope and belief that he will assist me to close the Tariff discussion in this House by Christmas. If that can be done by the adjournment - which I presume will be about the 15th or 18th inst. - I shall have no complaint to make.

It will be advisable for the Government to consider the desirability of sitting on more days in the week, and for a greater number of hours per day than hitherto.  </para>

                        <para>- It might be as well if the consideration of this matter were delayed until next week. After the understanding which has been arrived at between the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition, there may be no necessity for extra sitting days. </para>

                        <para>. - :I propose to give notice to-morrow, and to move on Tuesday next, that the House shall sit on Mondays. I shall also have to. ask honorable members not only to meet on Mondays, but to sit later on Fridays than has been customary, in order that wc may have an opportunity of taking a recess of, at any rate, a week or two at Christmas time. The matter has not been settled in Cabinet yet, but there seems to be a question as to whether we should adjourn for about three weeks, or for some five or six weeks. I think the general feeling will probably be in favour of the shorter adjournment. </para>
