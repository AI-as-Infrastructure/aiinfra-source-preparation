I do not know how the expenses were paid in all the States, but, of course, the amount does not include any portion paid by the Imperial Government, which would not be made a charge against the State finances. </para>

Some public m?n of these colonies - or, at any rate, some people have said to various Governments - " AVe will not trust you to make these appointments, but we will get someone else to do it, as you are not to be trusted - you, the' chosen of the people and of Parliament, are not to be trusted, and therefore some one else must have the power of appointment."

                        <para>- Yes but the right honorable member for East Sydney brought in similar provisions before, and they have been in operation for many years. However, we will leave that point. With regard to the Defence Bill, in which the Governor-General is Supreme, and will act on the advice of his Executive Council, I do not anticipate for one moment that the opinions of the officers having the chief command of the army or navy will be ignored or flouted. On the contrary, I believe that in 99 cases out of 100 their recommendations will be implicitly followed ; but they may not be followed without demur in all cases, and instead of the Government being under the thumb or under the foot of the military authorities, they will be responsible to Parliament, and in times of difficulty will be able to say "No." However, that is not the object I have in view. I do not anticipate any difficulty at all, because I know" from long experience that most of the appointments made in the civil service, in 99 cases out of 100, are not made by the Minister at all, as the Minister docs not care twopence about them, but are made on the recommendation of the permanent head of the department. </para>

                        <para>- I may say that the desire I have in regard to the administration of the Defence department is that matters connected with finance - disbursements and expenditure - should be as far removed as possible from the control of the military authorities. It seems to me that it is worse than useless to obtain the services of an expert in military matters, and to expect to secure good administration if we hamper him with a lot of details as to expenditure. In my view he would, under these circumstances, be called upon to expend his energies in a direction in which we do not require them to be exerted by such an officer. Apart from that, it seems to me that economy will be encouraged by separating military expenditure from military duties as far as we can throughout the States. I will now refer to a few of the principal features in the measure in the order in which they appear in the Bill. I may say at once that the administration of the defences of the country is to be carried on by the Governor-General on the advice of the Executive Government. There is to be a military officer appointed who will be charged with the military command and discipline of the forces, and who will have complete control of the forces throughout the Commonwealth in regard to all such matters. </para>

                        <para>- He certainly will be. He will be the general officer in command of the military forces, and power is also given for the appointment of a similar officer for the navy. 1 am not so sure - I thing it is very unlikely - that this naval officer will be appointed immediately, but no doubt the appointment will be made soon, although not so soon as that of the officer to command the military forces. </para>

                        <para>- It is like the right honorable gentleman himself ; he is not here for to-day only. The idea in calling the different places districts is that we wish to break down as far as we can - in the military system at any rate - the notion that the permanent forces belong to any particular part of Australia. The men are Australian soldiers, and will not remain all their lives in one place - either at Albany, or Queenscliff, or Thursday Island. They will be liable to be moved about, just as are regiments of the Imperial army. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt during the first five years it will be obligatory, for financial reasons, that they should. The idea is that in the beginning the districts will have the same boundaries as the States ; but I need mention only one place to show honorable members how much more convenient it would be to have it otherwise, Take the case of Broken Hill for instance. That place can be much more easily commanded for military purposes from South Australia than from New South Wales - at all events till New South Wales does what I wonder she did not do years ago - build a railway to Broken Hill from Cobar. If I had been Premier of New South Wales, I would have built that railway years ago. </para>

                        <para>- Each sub-district will require to have some officer in command, but he will not be the commandant. He will be under the command of the commandant of the whole district.It is proposed that the district commandants shall be chosen from the defence forces of the Commonwealth. There is no restriction as to the branch of the forces from which a commandant will be chosen. He may be an officer of the permanent forces, or of the militia, or of the volunteers. That I think is a good provision, inasmuch as it will give an incentive to those officers who are in the militia to aspire to commands in the various districts when vacancies occur. In taking this course, I am not acting in accordance with the views of the military commandants, who think that the choice of the district commandants should be restricted to officers of the permanent forces. But after taking the matter into serious consideration and having regard to the small number of our permanent forces as compared with the large number of our citizen soldiers, and seeing also that we depend for our defence not upon the permanent forces only but upon the citizen forces, I have arrived at the conclusion that we should do everything we can to encourage our citizen soldiery. With that object in view, I think that the highest positions of the defence forces should be open to them. </para>

                        <para>- It will enable that to be done. We have taken the forces of all the States, and clubbed them together, and bearing in mind the fact that one State has been generous in bestowing titles, and has given an officer who has only been a few years in the service a colonelcy, whereas in another State an officer, after 20 years' service, has been made only a major, this clause is essential. It would be very unfair when we bring all these forces together as one army, that the officer, who, after 20 years' service, holds the rank of major, and who in every respect perhaps, is equal, if not superior, to the colonel, who has only had five years' service, but who, through the generosity, or the rule prevailing in his State, has obtained quicker promotion, should not be able to secure the recognition of his rights. We should never have satisfaction under such a state of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- If it was .necessary the general officer would have to get some of them out of the way. There are many ways of doing it. In regard to the grading of the service, my own desire is - and I have no doubt that it will be so - that this" great power shall be very gently used, and that in dealing with those who already hold certain rank, great consideration shall be given before that rank is taken away from them. That it is necessary that this power should exist, however, I have no doubt whatever. Honorable members will notice that there is a provision for a half-pay list. I am sure that honorable members sitting on the cross benches will prick up their ears at any reference to half-pay; which generally means that a man is getting some pay and doing nothing for it. At the same time, I do not see how we can administer an army without having some provision for the payment of those whom we are not able to provide with employment at the moment. I have no doubt that when the Estimates are being passed year by year, great attention will be given to the half-pay list, but it is still absolutely necessary that provision should be made for it. Then clause 23 provides for unattached lists. I do not suppose any one will object to that, because, so far as I can see, there will be no expenditure in regard to it, and it will give an opportunity of making appointments on these lists which will cost nothing. </para>

                        <para>- We make no provision in the Bill, and unless the Commonwealth Legislature comes to the rescue, it seems to me that in the near future, at any rate, we shall find difficulty in providing for the cases of those who are .immediately retiring. This provision deals only with compulsory retirement, and it will strike a blow at a great many persons now in the military service. The next clause deals with the question of leave of absence, and I thought the best way of dealing with this was to deal with it in the same way as it is dealt with in the Public Service Bill. We should, I think, make no distinction between the military and the civil service in the matter of leave, and, therefore, I have embodied clause 26, which makes the same provision for leave as is provided for in the civil service. Honorable members will note that the Defence Force consists of the active forces, which comprise the small permanent force who look after the forts and armaments in the various States and the militia, who are partially paid, who have to undergo so many drills and certain duties, for which they are paid so much a year. Then we have the volunteer forces, consisting of those who are not bound to continuous naval or military 'service, and who are not ordinarily paid. </para>

It often happens that men say - -"You do so-and-so, and I do not want anything," but after a little time they get tired of the arrangement, and say - "You might as well give me something." </para>

                        <para>- Quite so : it is the fact. I know that we have one or two volunteer forces in Western Australia who are supposed to get nothing, but whenever they go into camp or serve on guards of honour, or do other work, they get paid, so that they are not really volunteers. Then we have the reserve forces, consisting of persons who have already been in the active forces, and have been transferred ; and there is a provision that persons who have served in the active forces for less than three years shall be transferred to the reserve forces only on approval by the district officer, and if they are certified as efficient. Next we have rifle clubs. They seem to be a very popular institution in Victoria, Western Australia, and I believe in other States. I think they cost too much in this State, where they are carried on on a different plan from that adopted in other places. It seems to me that the plan in Victoria is to require the Government to pay for everything, or nearly everything, and that being so, it is a very expensive item. </para>

                        <para>- We shall see. There are 30,000 members of rifle clubs, of whom 20,000 are in Victoria. In Switzerland the rifle clubs cost £360,000 a year, but of that sum £250,000 is provided by the clubs, and only £1 10,000 by the State. The towns and parishes have to provide the ranges, and rifle shooting is a favorite enjoyment on Sunday afternoon. In this State the ammunition alone which they fire costs an immense sum. I should be sorry to say how much, but if I said about £30,000 or £40,000 a year- perhaps £50,000-1 think I should be near the mark. At any rate, it seems to me that if -we are to carry on the clubs as I desire, we should make good shots of the men. But it must be done on some plan which is not too expensive. </para>

From clause 31 honorable members will notice that all male inhabitants of Australia except those who are exempt from service in the defence force who have resided therein for six months and are British subjects, and are between the ages of eighteen and 60 years are liable to serve. That, of course, would apply to a general call out, which would occur only in time of emergency, that is to say in time of war or invasion, or on the declaration or proclamation of such a contingency. I have some figures before me which show that if we called out those whom it is proposed to call out under the Bill, we should be able to muster 974,000 men. </para>

                        <para>- At the present time there are the various State laws. Without the provisions which I have read, it would not be lawful to send the forces of the Commonwealth beyond its territorial limits, or even to send the naval forces more than three miles from our shores while training on board ship. There is, however, no provision whatever under which citizen forces may be sent beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, unless they have voluntarily agreed to serve without the Commonwealth. It was not thought necessary to make that restriction in regard to the trained soldiers of the permanent forces. </para>

                        <para>- Clause 70, to which the honorable member refers, deals only with the railways and tramways which are the property of the Commonwealth or of a State. I think that it would have been' well, if it had been possible, to fix. the rates of pay in the Bill, but the rates of pay now existing are so various that it will take some little time to make uniform rates for the different grades and ranks throughout the service. We may, however, be able to do it before the Bill gets through committee. In Victoria the maximum amount of pay which a man can earn is £7 10s. a year. That amount is given to the man himself, but in addition, every man of the partially paid forces costs the State £15 10s. In New South Wales these men are paid at the rate of 8s. per day, and can earn £9 10s., which goes to the men themselves, but, in addition to that amount, they cost the State £17 16s. 7d. each. In Western Australia there is a capitation of £2 a head, which does not go to the man himself, because he is 'a volunteer ; but when he is called out for an Easter encampment, for guards of honour, and for escort duties, he receives 8s. a day, which comes to £5 17s. a year. In South Australia a man gets £5 a year, but I do not know how much more he costs the State. In Queensland a partially paid man gets £6 10s. a year, and costs ill 4 10s. in addition, while a volunteer costs a corresponding amount. Honorable member will thus see that the ordinary rate is about 8s. a day, which is a little bit more than the minimum wage for labourers in the various States. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members can well understand that people who have to work for their living cannot afford to give their services for nothing, except on. public holidays, however ardent may be their desire to serve their country as soldiers. A man cannot afford to give up half-a-day's wages in order to go soldiering, however much his inclination may be in that direction. I believe there is ah attempt, as far as possible, to work those days into the holidays, but, unless a man be paid his ordinary wages, he would actually be out of pocket, and in these days we cannot expect that. In the country it is different. A good many people there who join the volunteer corps are not laboring men, or men working for daily wages, but are young farmers and others who can get away for an afternoon's drill, without any great loss to themselves. In the centres of population, however, it seems to me that if we want a large citizen force we shall have to pay for it. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how many civil servants attend drill, but, so far as I know, no difference is made between them and other members of the forces, so far as payment is concerned. The civil servant, instead of looking on, if it be a holiday, takes his part. He has to get leave and, altogether, perhaps, he manages better than do the others. I am not speaking with authority, but, from my knowledge of the civil servant, I should think that he gets paid - I mean that if pay were offered to him I do not think he would refuse it. Clause 81 deals with military cadets, and in these I think we have the foundation stone of our system. </para>

Those of us who had the opportunity and the satisfaction of seeing the cadets at the great review at Flemington the other day, were, I am sure, very pleased and proud. We propose to obtain the services of the boy at school as a cadet, and to encourage him to become a senior cadet, when, I believe, he will not require very much more encouragement to join either the militia, the volunteers or some other portion of the defence forces. We shall not only teach him the drill, but we shall also teach " the young idea how to shoot." I believe that from the schools we may hope for good results for our citizen soldier system. It will be noticed that cadets are not liable for service in time of war, but that, of course, goes without saying. Clause 111 provides that there is nothing to prevent the Australian soldier from fighting for his King and country if he volunteers to do so, as, I am glad to say, he has done already. He has, however, to do it of his own free will. There is nothing in the Bill to compel members of the militia or of the volunteer forces to serve beyond the limits of the Commonwealth, unless they are desirous of doing so. I would like to refer to clause 116, because all those things I have been talking about as necessary to be done, mean the expenditure of a large sum of money. Clause 1 16 of that clause provides - </para>

                        <para>- I think it is a very good plan that in all these services the men should be made to contribute, and that the Government should assist them. In the Western Austral ian police force there is a similar provision, which, while certainly on a small scale, has done a great deal of good, though, perhaps, not so much good as it ought. In that State the Government provide annually a grant, and the men contribute so much to the fund from their pay. This provides a gratuity when the men retire, and in some cases the gratuity amounts to many hundreds of pounds, which are very welcome when a man becomes old, and is leaving the force. The best solution of the pension question is, in my opinion, to make the men contribute and then for Parliament to assist the fund. Sub-clause (4) of clause 118 provides that trustees of these funds are to be appointed by the Governor-General. I come now to the last clause, which gives general power to make regulations for carrying the Bill into effect. Honorable members will notice that the Acts mentioned in the first schedule are to be no longer applicable. I see the draftsman has not actually repealed the Acts, but by clause 5 it is provided that the State Acts specified in the first schedule shall not apply to the defence force of the Commonwealth ; and I suppose that is a more gentle way of getting rid of the Acts than, perhaps, the rough and ready plan of repeal, to which some exception might be taken. The second schedule sets out the ages for the compulsory retirement of officers of the Commonwealth military and naval forces ; while the third and fourth schedules describe the oaths to be taken. 1 have now dealt with all the provisions of the Bill to which I am able to draw attention at the present time; and I shall only say one or two words more, regretting, as I do, that I have already taken up too much time. At the commencement of my remarks I said that I felt some diffidence in this task, not having had very much to do with the defence forces in the past ; but really I ought not to have said so, because I was Defence Minister for many years. Still I had not much to do with the drafting of Acts, being engaged too much with other matters to pay much attention to the subject of the defence forces. Personally, I have given a good deal of attention to this Bill, in the preparation of which I have been greatly assisted by the commandants of the various States. I have also obtained assistance from all sources from which I thought I could profitably get it. I have sought aid from persons in the permanent force, in the militia, in the rifle clubs, and in the volunteers. Persons holding commissions in these forces have been consulted by me in a more or less private manner. I must say, however, that the Bill before honorable members is not in the shape in which it was submitted to me by the commandants. </para>

                        <para>- They submitted a draft Bill with a report, which draft Bill and report I have not the slightest objection - if honorable members desire it - to placing upon the table of the House. The foundation of this Bill is, to a very large extent, the Bill prepared by the commandants, but in very many particulars alterations have been made, so that while I thank the commandants for the assistance which they have rendered me, it would not be right to allow it to be assumed that this Bill is in any way the same as that which they prepared and submitted. It is not the same measure, and I take the sole responsibility for all the provisions which it contains. As I take it to be the desire of honorable members that they should have the commandants' Bill and their report before them, I shall have no objection whatever to placing those documents upon the table of the House. Among honorable members of this House there are many who have had military experience, either as officers or non-commissioned officers. I believe that one of my colleagues was a sergeant ! I am sanguine, therefore, that I shall receive a great deal of assistance from those honorable members in the perfecting of this Bill. I have been urged to include in this measure other provisions which have not been included. One of them relates to the appointment of a Council of Advice. I was advised to erect a Council of Advice whose function it would be to advise the Minister. But it seemed to me that in the present condition of affairs that suggestion was not a practicable one. In order to have an effective council of advice it appeared to me that the members of the council must almost necessarily belong to one State. We could not get a council of advice to meet, if one member of it belonged to Western Australian, another to Queensland, another to Tasmania, and another to New South Wales. It seems to me therefore, that at any rate, until we get more settled, it is far better that the Government and the general officer commanding should be responsible to this House than that a committee of advice should be appointed, which committee, unless its members were confined to the State in which the Government might be located would have very little opportunity of meeting. </para>

                        <para>- No. I think it is preferable in our present circumstances to trust to the Government and its naval and military advisers, assisted by committees if necessary. There is nothing to prevent our getting committees to advise us from the beginning if that course is desirable. One of the advantages dangled before the eyes of the public by myself and others who advocated federation was that union would mean the more adequate defence of the Australian continent. One of the principal reasons advanced why "Western Australia should join the federation was that the people of the Commonwealth would be obliged under the Constitution to defend that State from invasion. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest for my right honorable friend's consideration whether it would not be better to adopt the course which I believe prevails in more than one of the States, that is, that whilst we all understand that the Prime Minister is the Minister who deals with these things in the House, the fact- is recognised that the departments themselves are not under the control of the Prime Minister. For instance, the appointments made 'to the various offices in the Senate and the House of Representatives are not under the control of the Minister, but are made by a specified arrangement. I would suggest that the arrangement in the Supply Bills under which the Senate and House of Representatives are put under the Minister of External Affairs is perhaps an inconvenient arrangement, and that they should be put, as they are in the States, as separate from the ordinary departments of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- It is no doubt necessary to submit the Estimates as they are framed by the President and the Speaker, and, I believe, the practice is for the Government to put them on in that form, even when they intend to object to an item or an amount. I have no doubt that that is a very proper course to follow. With reference to the amount of this Supply, I do not feel inclined to complain of the fact that the Government are asking for three months' supply instead of one, because I have always considered that an application every month for Supply, although in one sense a very convenient arrangement,enabling members to review a very large number of matters, constitutes, as a rule, a very serious obstruction to public business. Therefore, I do not take any exception to the fact that the Ministers have made an application for three months' instead of one month's Supply. We are under a very great difficulty in dealing with these amounts, because as yet we have no list of the officers in the public service, and we are somewhat in the dark as to the arrangements which the Government have really made. I find a number of differences in the amounts which are being paid to the heads of the different departments, and this is also a very inconvenient and unusual arrangement. For instance, in the Supply Bill, which is now the Supply Act, there was a proposal that the secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs should have a salary of £400 a year. </para>

                        <para>- It is rather awkward to have the term " secretary to the Minister " applying to the Minister's private secretary. Speaking of these private secretaries, I must say that I strongly object to the fact that these gentlemen who are called private secretaries are not taken from the ordinary ranks of the services of the States. I feel that a necessary incident of the present system is that every Minister who comes in is bound to dispense with the services of the private secretary appointed by the previous Government. </para>

After I made this statement to him, his salary was voted, and his designation was altered to secretary to the Prime Minister ; the question afterwards arose whether his status should not be relegated to the consideration of the commissioner for the public service. </para>

                        <para>- So far as the Public Service Commissioner is concerned, Ministers know thoroughly what his duties will be, irrespective of whether the Bill is passed or not. Ministers knew the scope of his duties almost before the Bill was brought in. It is of very, great importance, of course, that that gentleman should be appointed, because the Prime Minister will admit that he knows now what the scope of his duties will be, and the sooner Ministers are relieved from what they themselves must consider an abnormal state of things, the better. The policy of the Public Service Bill is to relieve Ministers from the position they are in at present, and I admit it is rather an invidious one. The Public Service Bill will relieve Ministers from it, and, I think, will greatly add to their comfort. I know it would be so in my case. I am sorry Ministers have not themselves adopted the course of appointing temporarily officers in the public service where they are required, because in that case those officers would not be prejudiced in their former positions if the final arrangement involved further changes. No harm would have been done to the gentlemen themselves or to any other person, and in the event of the confirmation of their appointment there would have been a stream of healthy promotion right through the service. That is the reason why I attach so much importance- to, and regret so deeply appointments that have cut off that stream of promotion. However, I have said all I wish to say in reference to that question. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will allow me it does not come to .that yet, for the new services, according to my calculation. I propose to be very brief, and what I have to say will consist chiefly of a comparison of figures - a comparison of the state of affairs that we actually have presented at the present moment in this new schedule, with the Convention's estimates of new services of the Commonwealth made in 1897. With regard to transferred services it may be said that it is not to be wondered at that the Convention's estimates have been exceeded, because the State expenditure on those services has been growing in the meantime. But with regard to new services of the Commonwealth, there is really no - reason why the Convention estimates should have been exceeded. The services for the Senate, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates, Library, Refreshment-room, and incidentals connected with Parliament House, were estimated, so far as I can gather from the estimates of the Convention, at £28,400 per annum. I may say, with respect to this, that I have had to arbitrarily group some of the items in the Convention's estimate, because the details of the Convention's estimates are not the same as in the schedule placed before us. Already, in connexion with the group to which I have referred, the annual expenditure provided for in this schedule - and I presume the Treasurer will tell me if I am wrong in assuming that this schedule is merely as all Supply estimates should be, the ordinary annual expenditure, and does not contain any unusual items - the Estimates provided for in this schedule for the group to which I have referred already come to £26,268 per annum. In other words, we are already within £2,000 of the limit allowed in the Convention's estimates, and I doubt whether we are yet at the end of the expenditure. There is a noticeable thing in connexion with this matter, and it is that a very large portion of the expenditure appearing in this schedule is for incidentals and contingencies, and what that means exactly we do not know. The next group I have taken is the Executive Council, External Affairs, and Attorney-General. It is difficult to separate exactly in the Convention's estimates what has reference to these departments. </para>

                        <para>- They were not. There ' was a number of things not provided for in that estimate, and the inference I draw from that is not what the right honorable and learned gentleman draws, that, therefore, these increases are not to be exclaimed against or remarked upon. The inference I draw is that we should be all the more careful to be within the estimate of expenditure arrived at by the Convention. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that. But these errors which run first one way and then the other will disappear in the total if the Treasurer will wait. For the Department of Home Affairs, which includes Public Service Commissioner, and Electoral Office - not electoral expenses, which I, for the present, leave out, because they seem to run into about what the Convention's estimate was- -the total was £10,745 per annum, and the expenditure already provided for in the present schedule is £16,400 per annum. This department has already outrun the Convention constable. </para>

Then we have for the Treasurer and Auditor-General a total sum of £3,500 allowed -at present. The Convention allowance was £12,500, but the right honorable and learned gentleman will agree that when the Commonwealth commences to collect fees it will require officers to collect them, and that the expenditure will then run up considerably. Then the new expenditure on the Customs is already at the rate of £3,630 a year, on defence £5,600, and on the Postmaster-General's department £4,950. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; so that the saving is only nominal. I could not get hold of the items referring to Queensland, but in South Australia the Customs expenditure remains at about £24,000 for each of the four years, in Western Australia at about £31,000, and in Tasmania it has been £8,000, £9,000, £10,000, and for the present year £9,000 again, so that the change has been very little. -The total expenditure of the six States for the three years preceding federation was £297,000, £297,000, and £298,000 in the respective years, and for the first year of the Commonwealth it is to be £262,000. But, as a great many services which were paid for by the States under the head of Customs expenditure have not been taken over by the Commonwealth, there is really a considerable increase in the estimates for this year. </para>

If it can be shown that my basis of comparison is a wrong one, and that we are not about to spend more money than we should, no one will be more pleased than I shall be. The Victorian expenditure upon defence was £152,000, £171,000, and £196,000 per annum in the three years preceding federation, while the expenditure charged to that State by the Commonwealth this year is to be £256,000. 1 cannot see why the ordinary annual increase of £19,000 or £20,000 should suddenly grow to £60,000.  </para>

                        <para>- In Queensland the expenditure upon defences for the three years preceding federation was £75,000, £105,000, and £160,000, and the amount provided for in these Estimates is at the rate of £208,000 per annum. In the South Australian expenditure there is a great increase, in the Western Australian expenditure practically none, and in the Tasmanian expenditure very little. The total expenditure of the six States upon defence for the three years preceding federation was £477,000, £536,000, and £676,000, and the expenditure of the Commonwealth for this year is to be £S08,000 - an increase, as compared with the State appropriations of last year, of £130,000. In regard to the Postal expenditure, I shall give honorable members only the totals. The total appropriations for the Postal department in the Appropriation Acts of the six States for the three years preceding federation was £2,267,000. £2,177,000- an increase of £110,000, and £2, 280,000- an increase of £103,000. The amount to be expended by the Commonwealth during the present year is £2,600,000, an increase of £320,000. I confess I cannot understand how it is, except it may be that the Commonwealth Government does not know the whole of each department in each State as fully as the State Governments do. But even if - these Estimates in the present schedule are based on the States' Estimates :-- </para>

                        <para>- Even if they are based on the States' Estimates, the fact remains that the totals proposed to be provided, very much exceed the totals provided in any preceding year by the States' Governments. The Treasurer is again referring to the question of what is in the Supplementary Estimates - what is in his Supplementary Estimates. Every year that the States' Governments have framed their Estimates, the States' Governments have had to bring in Supplementary Estimates, and the Treasurer gives me, as his answer, that the present figures are based on the States' Estimates. We may, therefore, expect that next year, the Estimates now under consideration will be supplemented by Supplementary Estimates, based on the States' Supplementary Estimates. If every year the States' Estimates have required supplementing, and if the present Estimates are based on the States' Estimates, we may expect that the present Estimates will also require supplementing. In the six States the totals for the three transferred departments were, in the year' 1898-9, £2,841,000, as provided in the Appropriation Act; in the following year, £3,005,000, and in the year following that, £3,240,000. Of course, I do not answer for a few thousand pounds here or there in these large figures. In the schedule under consideration we provide for £3,670,000, an increase of £430,000 on the amount provided last year, and an increase of £1,000,000 on the Adelaide estimates. </para>

                        <para>- To a considerable extent it may be. But I do not think, for example, that the change' from penny postage to two-penny postage in Victoria will result in anything like an increased revenue to the State. I know the States have to stand these losses, but we are responsible for the management of the departments, and if the States find themselves involved in these losses and deficits, they will put the blame on us. The States will say - "You are managing these departments, and these departments have caused a loss." Even if we were in the right, and the States were in the wrong, these losses would be charged or debited, so to speak, to the Commonwealth, and that would not help to' insure that satisfaction with federation we all, I think, desire to see insured. As I say, I only offer these figures for the consideration of the Treasurer. If my figures are wrong I shall be quite satisfied to have them proved wrong, but there is something in them which, I think, requires explaining and answering. In the first place, our expenditure is running up at far too rapid a rate, and, in. the second place, the transferred expenditure, whatever may be the cause, is also running up at far too rapid a rate. It is the business of Parliament, or rather of this House especially, to see that, the expenditure does not run up too rapidly. . I am quite aware that the Treasurer has, in each of his two interim Budget statements, pointed' out that up to the present time the Adelaide Convention estimate has not been reached. The Treasurer has relied very largely on that ; and this is the first time that we have heard that the Convention estimate is of no use, the Treasurer on the two previous occasions having pointed out that the expenditure was still under that estimate. If the items that have to be increased, but have not yet been increased, be taken into account, it will be found that the expenditure is very close to the total estimate of the Convention, margin and all. If the growth of the State expenditure each year, as compared with the growth shown in these Estimates, be taken, it will be seen that instead of a steady annual increase, such as might be expected from .a steady improvement in the state of affairs of the Commonwealth, there is a jump, and an alarming jump at that. At any rate, these figures have made me feel that we shall have to be excessively careful in watching every item of the_ Estimates, and shall have to see that no unnecessary sum is spent, but that as far as possible both the new expenditure and the expenditure of the transferred departments, do not exceed by a single penny that which is absolutely necessary. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the honorable member did not mean that the new expenditure would run to that amount, because I think that we shall find that the amount estimated at Adelaide - although that did not provide for many matters that ought to have been provided for, and which would have been provided for had they been foreseen - will not be largely exceeded, if exceeded at all. If I recollect aright, there was one disturbing element omitted from the consideration of the question at that time. When we were dealing with the question in Adelaide, we were dealing with the States that were likely to federate, and Queensland was not taken into consideration at all. If Queensland had been taken into consideration, the estimates then made wouk have been much larger in many of the departments, and that would make a considerable difference in the figures which the honorable and learned member for Corinella has quoted. For curiosity I have been comparing some of the proposed expenditure with .the items suggested at Adelaide, and many of them are closely correct. </para>

                        <para>- With regard to the Estimates under discussion there are many matters included in the three months, . because they could not be paid before the end of the last financial year, and in estimating three months' supply we also estimate liberally in order to be on the safe side. The honorable and learned member for Corinella must not assume because he finds that the proposed expenditure in the Postmaster-General's department is £65,000 for three months, that he has only to multiply that sum. by four in order to get the total expenditure for the year. When we come to deal with the full Estimates, that sum will be considerably reduced, and the same will occur in other departments - taking defence expenditure and the expenditure generally. There is no doubt that the expenditure has been going up by leaps and bounds in all the States since the estimate was made at Adelaide, The defence estimate at Adelaide was; I think, something, under £500,000. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable and learned member allow me ? The actual estimate of defence expenditure was something under £500,000, but we thought we ought to be extra liberal, and we put £250,000 more on for the expenditure under the Commonwealth,, and thus raised the estimated expenditure to £750,000. Already the States have far and away exceeded that amount of expenditure. I suppose the States expenditure on defence will be now somewhere between £800,000 and £900,000; and we have to take into consideration also the fact that there is an amount of £116,000 or £126,000 in connexion with the Auxiliary Squadron. The expenditure has gone up rapidly in all the States. In the Postal department of Victoria we cut the expenditure down very low, but were then told that that meant nothing but sweating. </para>

                        <para>- It is hard to tell, but no doubt it is a considerable sum. As honorable members know, a little step taken the other night means an expenditure of £80,000; and. I do not think my colleague, at the time he allowed that amendment in the Public Service Bill to pass, realized that it involved such a heavy expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- It is not provided for in this schedule, and one of the difficulties which the Treasurer will have to contend with in the preparation of his financial statement will be in ascertaining what expenditure can be allowed in the various States. My honorable friend has said that there was £24,000 more for salaries provided for in this Bill than in the previous Supply Bill. But the honorable and learned member must recollect that during the last six months all the departments were practically working with the State services. Many of the Commonwealth appointments were made only during the months of May and June. The new expenditure which is provided for in connection with new offices can be easily ascertained, because those new offices have been very clearly shown in order that honorable members may ask any questions they choose with regard to any. particular item upon which they may desire information. The honorable and learned member makes it appeal that we are expending £15, 000 a year more than the Adelaide estimate, which, it should be remembered, was only a bare estimate. Nobody Gould possibly sit down at that time and say what these new departments would cost, and therefore we made the very wise provision of allowing- £50,000 or £60,000 as a margin upon which to work. When I have the opportunity of placing all the details with regard to the transferred departments before the House, I hope that honorable members will have no cause to regret the amounts to be expended, and I can assure them that, so far as I am able to prevent it, those amounts will not be more than are absolutely necessary. We must not overlook the fact that in connexion with many of the appointments - take the appointments which I have made in the Treasury as an example - the State will be enabled to make a considerable saving. The same remark applies to the appointments which have been made in the post-office. The officers to fill these positions have' been taken as far as possible from the State services, and that course will permit of a considerable saving being made in those services. There is no doubt whatever that when the Commonwealth gets into full working order, and when we have one central Administration carefully checking the expenditure in all the States, and taking care to see that it does not grow inordinately, we shall be able to reduce the amount at present expended, by the transfer of officers from services which are overmanned to other services. In Victoria we know that we did reduce our State services to a very large extent. That has not been done in New South Wales, because in that State they were not forced to retrench to such an extent as we were. I am told by the Postmaster-General that in his department alone when vacancies occur in other States he will be able to make transfers, and thus effect a considerable saving to the States. This is a matter, however, with which it is not fair, to deal upon u Supply Bill. The amounts put into this Supply Bill do not necessarily mean that four times their aggregate will be required to provide for the services of the year. I have the draft Estimates before me - and it is well known that departments always ask for large increases : but when the principal Estimates are brought down, honorable members will have the opportunity of seeing what the Government propose. These amounts are not the Estimates proposed by the Government, but are based as nearly as possible on the expenditure of the various States during the last financial year. </para>

                        <para>- No; the Estimates are now being printed, and my honorable friend will realize that the Estimates for six States will form no small volume, and that the Treasurer will have no light task in going through them all and ascertaining that he is able to justify the proposed expenditure to this House. In the meantime w-e have simply to ask the different departments to give us an estimate of an amount sufficient to cover them for three months' Supply. That being so, the calculations of the honorable and learned member for Corinella are not correct. Although I admit that the expenditure in I the States has gone up very largely during the last few years, it must be borne in mind that the revenue has also increased very largely, and the amount to which we have to look is the net loss of the various services transferred. It would be impossible for me at the present tune to give the full details, and I do not know that it is wise to alarm the public by creating the impression that we are incurring an enormous expenditure. When the Estimates are submitted we can discuss the matter fully ; but I ask honorable members to accept my assurance that every effort will be made to see that the new expenditure does not in-' crease more than is absolutely necessary, and that the transferred expenditure is kept down to the lowest possible requirements. My right honorable and learned friend the leader of the Opposition has chosen to challenge certain appointments which have been made outside of the State services. But the House dealt with those-- </para>

                        <para>- Ministers generally are not appointing men from their own States, because the permanent head of the Customs department has been taken from Victoria, and the same course has been followed with regard to the Defence department and the Treasurer's department. Nor have the other two Ministers attempted to appoint as permanent heads officers from their own States. With regard to this particular appointment, the position was a difficult one. We laid down a rule, so far as the new departments were concerned, that £750 a year was sufficient remuneration for the permanent head at the start.. The permanent heads of the various departments were appointed at that rate, except the Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister, who was allowed an extra £50 a year. But when we come to deal with the transferred departments, we cannot apply that rule, because we find that the permanent head would then be receiving a less salary than many of the officers who are under his control. Therefore, we must give some remuneration to the gentleman who has control of the whole department throughout the Commonwealth over and above what has been given to the officers who have control of the various departments in the States. In South Australia the head of the Postal department was receiving £1,000 a year In New South Wales the permanent head was receiving £920, and in Victoria £900. Quite irrespective, therefore, of what our desires might be, we could not appoint the permanent head of the central department at a salary less than was being given to the officers mentioned. </para>

I can easily understand what has been done, because I have done it in my own case.

If I had been called upon to go to Queensland or to New. South Wales for an officer, I should have had no experience such as would have enabled me to judge properly in making a suitable selection. </para>

No doubt the Minister is well "acquainted with the qualifications of the officer who has been appointed, and I do not think any one will challenge the fitness of the gentleman who has been referred to for the position to which he has been appointed. And are we going to say that £1,000 a year is too high a salary ? </para>

                    I. would point out in connexion, with this matter that because Mb. Oxenham happens to have the position of assistant secretary to- the department, it does not follow that it gives him any right whatever. to. any of the vacancies, when they take place, in the positions of- deputy postmasters-general in the States. This officer was selected because in the. first instance when
                    took the position of Postmaster-General he. asked the permanent head of the Postal department in his own State -
                    - if he could give him some officer who could go round with him for the time being and attend to the various matters that were found to require attention while he was travelling from State to State.
                    was selected, and was with
                    for several months, and during, that time he acquired a large knowledge and experience in all matters that came before the Minister in- the working of the department, and the Minister, exercising the. discretion which I think he fairly has, thinks that the position of assistant secretary ought, to be filled by
                    In regard to. the post-office, the appointments have been given to gentlemen, who have been known to the committee .which has been sitting for several months past in working out all the details. They have an intimate knowledge of what has been going on, and in regard, to these appointments and to the other appointments that are to be made, great' discretion must be given, to- the Minister, for the. time being. These- appointments should not be challenged unless it can be- shown* that some grievous wrong, has been- done; I do not know that any wrong has been done in any of: the States,, or that any wrong will be done by any of the appointments for which, it is proposed to make provision in this Bill. However, these are the matters that have been referred to. There is no. reflection oni
                    because-
                    has been, selected. It is not. for a moment thought, that he would- not have been competent to fill the position; but there- might have been, some little jealousy if a Victorian had been. put at the head of this department. We might have heard just as many challenges if some, one else had been, put there.

The- Budget statement will be aiL important, statement, but while- the House- is sitting day after day it is a very difficult, thing to get out the various details. However;.! am pressing, the matter on, and; the- statement will be. made at the earliest possible moment. In the meantime I- ask honorable members,, in justice to the Government and in order to. prevent any- idea being, entertained outside that we are going, to rush, into any large expenditure in connexion with the affairs of the Commonwealth, to wait until the detailed statement' is before them. I assure them that they will then, find that the Government have kept down, the new and transferred expenditure to- the lowest, possible, amount'. Of course some, of the.expenditure will be borne by some of the States, and they say - " Why should we not. spend as. much as we like in our own State seeing, that we have to, 1Da,v the money?" But the answer to- that is that we cannot, allow them to go- on. spending- as much as they like, because the- time will come, and- 1 hope it will not be very long: in coming,.. when the expenses will not be charged against the State, but on another basis altogether. Therefore, we ought to have the right, no matter what the States may say to keep down that expenditure when we think it is wise to do so in the interests of the whole of Australia. </para>

That is a position that we cannot allow. We cannot deal with the desires of every particular State, but have to study the expenditure with regard to the interest of the whole Commonwealth. I would again ask the committee not to enter now into a discussion which will come properly on the Budget, when I shall have an opportunity of placing the exact details before honorable members. Then I shall be in a position to answer any criticisms, and I can assure honorable members that in the mcantime the new and transferred expenditure will be kept down as low as it possibly can be in the interests of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>-So far as the explanation of the Treasurer relates to the matter of appointments, I have no comment to make,because so long as experienced and tried officers are selected for the various offices we must trust a good deal to the discretion of Ministers, at any rate until the Public Service Commissioner comes into existence. In connexion with the expenditure, however, I doubt whether, on close investigation, the statement that the new expenditure has been cut down within proper limits will be borne out. Because we find here that a number of new offices have been created which seem to me, at any rate at the first blush, to be altogether unnecessary. With regard to the Defence department, I find that provision is made for a secretary at £900 per annum, a chief accountant at £600 per annum, and a chief clerk at £540. These officers are all in addition to officers filling similar positions in each of the various States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is likely to be done. I, for one, hope that the feeling of the committee will be tested with regard to the salaries to be paid to the officers of the administrative branch of our military system. The Military department should not require a highly paid officer as secretary. It is in no sense like the post-office, where we require an expert in each of the various States - a man who has grown up in the service, who knows every detail of it, and how the work may be best accomplished. The post office is a large commercial concern, and I can quite understand the appointment of an officer at a high salary in order to get the best services possible. But for the merely clerical work involved in the administration of the Defence department, the country does not want to pay £900per annum. I have always protested in New South Wales against such payments for merely clerical work involving no administrative ability at all. This is only on a par with the usual treatment meted out to the glorified persons who pose as military authorities. Whenever military affairs come up for discussion these persons resent anything being said in criticism of the salaries affected, and there seems to be a certain amount of deference paid by Members of Parliament to the requests of the Military Commandants that the circumstances do not at all justify- so far, at any rate, as I can learn. I therefore protest against this particular item, and hope that the committee will see the wisdom of cutting it down materially. With regard to the Attorney-General's department, I should like to ask the honorable and learned gentleman concerned what there is to do to necessitate the payment of a chief clerk, an assistant parliamentary draftsman, and a clerk, in addition to the parliamentary draftsman. I presume that the Attorney-General's department at the present time is largely dealing with the drafting of Bills. There being no High Court in existence, I do not understand what more there can be for these officers to do. </para>

                        <para>- Far from it, though drafting is their main work. There are fifteen or sixteen Bills upon the notice-paper of this House, and five or six upon the notice-paper of the Senate. Almost every one of those Bills is either drafted or in course of being drafted. When amendments are made in committee, in both Chambers, they have to be attended to by the draftsman. I undertake to say that when the work of preparing those Bills, supervising them in committee, and watching over their progress is taken into consideration, it will be found that there is work enough to do to warrant a far larger staff than the Attorney-General has at present. Indeed a great deal of the difficulty I have had to encounter in this House has been largely due to the fact that we have been attempting with our existing staff to contend with an amount of work that could not very well be done by them. In addition to the drafting, however, the transferred departments of the Commonwealth are every day sending , to us catalogues of legal questions dealing with difficulties that constantly arise. I have been engaged in writing legal opinions, sometimes long and sometimes short, upon those matters, which are such as have necessarily arisen in connexion with departments working for the first time under a new written Constitution. Some of these questions require immediate answers. If the honorable member for Bland will call and see what the officers in my department are doing, I venture to say that he will be surprised at the large amount of business that is involved and at the extreme modesty of these demands. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable and learned gentleman for his explanation. Undoubtedly the drafting of Bills does involve a great amount of work, but I do not think it will be anything like so heavy when the machinery Bills are disposed of. When I spoke I was under the impression that the Chief Clerk and the Assistant Parliamentary Draftsman were two different officers. </para>

                        <para>- Then we find that a similar proposition is being made in regard to the post-office. I have no exception to take to the personnel of the appointments, but the Minister is going to be assisted by a secretary at £1,000 per annum, and by an assistant secretary at £600 per annum, who I suppose will do all the work the secretary ought to do. In all £1,600 per annum is to be paid to these two officers,and the Deputy Postmasters-General in the States will continue to carry on the work they are doing now. They will run the department while the Secretary of the Post-office, although above them in salary and position, will have practically nothing to do. It seems to me that if Ministers were anxious to economize they would keep their Deputy Postmasters-General in their various positions, the Minister, of course, being over them. I do not really see that there is any necessity at present for creating a separate office of Secretary to the Post-office department. </para>

                        <para>- We must have a nominal head, and that nominal head ought to be the Deputy Postmaster-General in one or other of the central States. I do not say that it ought to be the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales or Victoria, but the gentleman filling the position in some central State could be the nominal head. In my opinion the Minister, with officials under him in each of the States, who have had so many years experience, and know how the postal machine works, should be able to control his department without going to this extra expense. He certainly should have a chief clerk and a few other officers at a comparatively small salary to carry out work that must be attended to, but to have the highest paid officer in each of these departments - the Customs, the Post-office, and again in the Defence department - to overlook the correspondence that comes from the various States to the Ministerial head and to advise him, seems to me to be a most improper waste of money. </para>

                        <para>- It does not always follow that this is done. If these various Deputy Postmasters-General are worthy of their salaries, there should not be any necessity for a man to be placed over them to instruct them, other than the Minister, who, of course, instructs them in regard to matters of policy. There should be no necessity for another mere official to be put. over them, especially when we believe that it is going to be a difficult matter to raise the money that the Constitution makes it necessary for us to raise in order to pay these various sums. It has been suggested in the newspapers that a loan of £1,000,000 is going to be raised for Commonwealth purposes. I have no doubt that such a loan is necessary if the Ministers have decided upon it. </para>

                    (Northern Melbourne).I have just one suggestion to make. I quite agree with the Treasurer's statement that honorable members ought to be very careful not to alarm the public with regard to the Commonwealth expenditure. There is quite sufficient alarm at present, without stimulating it. I also agree with the Treasurer, that the public, as well as honorable members, will await with interest the delivery of his Budget statement. At the same time I can inform the Treasurer that the expenditure of the different departments, especially the new expenditure, will .be most carefully scanned, and if I may . judge from what I have heard in different quarters, there is no department whose expenditure will be so critically scanned as the Department of Defence. There is one suggestion which I think I might make at this stage in order to save time. The Treasurer has not indicated in any way on the face of these papers which of the items are new items, as contrasted with the last Estimates.

                    (East Sydney).- The Treasurer has covered what I think to be the serious mistakes of the Ministry, in preferring certain persons outside the service to the great body of the public service officers, by speaking of the hurry in which Ministers were. It was a hurry entirely of their own creation, -and it has been fraught, and will be in the future fraught, with very serious consequences. There was nothing that called. upon the Ministry to take over the Post and Telegraph department until their arrangements w-ere perfectly .complete. They could have left the six States to run their six systems on their six Acts, which the Federal Government have to do, until their uniform Act is passed, and in the interval they could have had their Minister. They could have had their Postmaster-General from the first. I do not object to that. Then Ministers could have worked out a federal scheme, so that when they took the post-office over, they could have taken it over on a uniform scheme of their own.

                        <para>- I am not here to answer questions. I am here to say that honorable members have no right to submit propositions like that, and those propositions have no right to be carried, without our knowing exactly what they are going to cost the country. While I am not averse to that proposal, we have a right to know what such proposals are going to cost. A further proposal was submitted that women should be placed in a similar position, and I told the House then that I believed it would cost £30,000 or £40,000 to carry that out. From inquiries. I have made since, I believe it will cost that much. We cannot expect economy if these motions are going to be pressed upon the Government, because while we want, no doubt, to keep down the high salaries, the savings are really to be made by keeping the ordinary salaries at a fair rate. While I wish to do justice to men and women in the service, and to see that they get a fair return for their work, .we have no right to propose the making of sweeping changes without considering what they are going to cost. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well to talk of pinching the poorer paid servants, but we are here to do justice to the country, and I know of hundreds of farmers in the country who would consider themselves well off if, after paying all expenses, they made £100 a year clear. I know also that there are miners working 2,000 and 3,000 feet down for £2 and £2 5s. a week, and I say the proposed increase of salaries for work that is not -worth half the same wages was not justified without a full exposition of the matter being laid before the committee. I do hope, therefore, that in the discussion of these Estimates members will remember that they must not press large increases on the Government if they expect them at the same time to economize. </para>

                    (Werriwa).- I think it is a matter of great regret that the Ministry, in giving us this schedule, did not supply more information to the committee. When the Treasurer submitted a temporary Supply Bill for the month before, we were "assured that very much fuller information indeed would be given to honorable members. Now we are asked for three months' supply, and we find exactly the same deficiency as there was before. On that occasion, strange to say, we found that there were four appointments, made by the Prime Minister, of junior barristers of the New South Wales bar. They were all men who were described as absolutely the best men that could be found for the positions they were called upon to fill. One, I think, was
                    Hunt, whose appointment received a great deal of criticism. It was an unfortunate thing of course for Ministers, because it certainly threw a considerable cloud of suspicion if nothing else over them, that it was a political appointment, owing to the fact that
                    Hunt had been secretary to the Prime Minister during a political campaign.

                        <para>- It may have shown that they knew exactly the type of man they had to deal with. They knew that he would consider office only as a means of exercising political patronage, and not because of the effects which might arise to the people if he carried out his duties properly. What I chiefly regret is that the sole aim of the Ministry seems to be to consider Ministerial office valuable only because of the means it affords to exercise political patronage. Friends here and friends there - political friends it is true in some cases - are all being pitchforked into various places. Then we come to the Postmaster-General, and find that the very same thing is happening in his department. Does anybody really believe that those two gentlemen would have been placed at the head of his department if the Postmaster-General had not personally known them, and was trying to advance their interests without for one moment considering the interests of the State? </para>

                        <para>- I think, sir, the committee is entitled to have -the names of these officers set -forth in -the schedule. Last month we were promised that the next Bill would be brought forward in proper form : but it has not been done. I think this Bill ought to be sent back until it is done. I am waiting for some assurance from the Minister that we are to receive the names of these persons and to know more details about the appointments. The committee will not be put off again. If one or two of us have to stand alone we shall insist upon the items being supplied. We shall not allow 'Ministers, merely because they are in a majority, to deal with us in-this way. When I was discussing the-previous "Supply Bill I pointed out -that the most of 'the trouble which the Ministry had incurred in that respect had arisen entirely through their action in 'taking over a couple of great departments when there was no necessity for -them to take that step. If they had considered matters truly and well they would not have done so, -and we would have been in a position with themselves to know -exactly what work they had before them. We should have been able to tell the amount of expenditure incurred by the new -federal departments, and everything would have gone on in the various -States as it ought to have done. We find that owing to their action in taking over the Postal -and Telegraph department before it was necessary no new offices can be constructed or new lines erected. Almost the whole of that great department has been thrown into a state of confusion solely through the action of Ministers themselves. That confusion, when it is clearly the result of Ministers' own want of thought, deservedly ought to be condemned by the committee. </para>

                        <para>- Had he not taken over the department as lie has done, he. would not have had access to the documents, statistics, and- other information which he has had under his command. He could only have come, into- the office by courtesy of the States in control,, though no doubt that courtesy would have been, extended to him. At the same time,, he has had freer access to all the details which were necessary to enable him to prepare the measure he has introduced than he-otherwise: would- have had. The same thing' applies to- other offices- of the State.. However much we may be in love with economy - and I want as much as anybody to see economy practised - we should not be captious in our criticism. I believe that when the money comes to be expended under the careful management of the Treasurer, a considerable portion of the vote we are now passing will be found to lapse. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to get the opinion of the committee in regard to the appointment of a secretary to the Defence department, at a salary of £900 per annum. I have no sort of feeling about the gentleman who, I understand, has been appointed, because I do not know him ; and I submit an amendment merely as a protest against what seems to me unnecessary extra military expenditure. The point I take is that for the work required in the administration of the Defence department, more especially from the centre, all that is necessary is a clerical staff of very modest dimensions indeed. It does not seem to me that there is anything like the necessity for a secretary to this department that exists for an under-secretary to any other department. The military administration will be worked for the most part through the commandants, and the clerical work, in my opinion, can be efficiently done by the chief clerk, whose salary is set down here at £540 per annum. I would draw attention to the fact that, in addition to the Minister, there are no less than twelve officials provided for in this Defence department. There is the secretary at £900 per annum ; the chief accountant at £600, the chief clerk at £540 ; five clerks, one at £310, one at £235, one at £200, one at £160, and one at £80. The last-named, I presume, would be a junior. Then there is a senior messenger at £132 per annum, a messenger at £96, a junior messenger at £42, and a caretaker at £110. This, it seems to me, is setting up a large department to attend to the correspondence that comes from the various heads of departments in the States, and to act as a go-between the Minister and the commandants. In New South Wales at the present time there is a military secretary who is paid either £750 or £800 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- What is his salary? Mr.WATSON. - At present he receives £900 per annum. My object is not to dis- possess him of his salary, but to prevent his transfer to this post - and the appointment to his former office of another man - at a considerably higher salary than there is any justification for paying. My contention is that there is no necessity for the first two officers mentioned in this schedule., namely the secretary and the chief accountant. They are quite unnecessary for the carrying out of the work of that department. There is a danger it seems to me of spending too much in departments of this character. I suppose, sir, that I had better move to reduce the total vote by the amount set clown to the secretary, namely £900 ? </para>

No doubt the- Minister is correct in saying that he must have- a secretary, and; if we- strike the item out altogether, that necessary office will be done away with. I think it would be better if we proposed: a reduction! of £500- in the total of . the administrative- items, leaving it to the. Minister to allot the reduction in whatever way he thinks fit. Whilst the Minister tries to impress this- committee with the fact that there is no great growth of expense* in connexion with the Defence' department, I contend that all the advocates of federation' impressed! it upon the people that the Defence ' department was one of those in which; great savings were to be effected. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt we should; under the Commonwealth have a very muck more efficient service at a lower total cost than we have been incurring in. the- several States,, under- separate Defence systems. Although the Treasurer- has told us that we shall have plenty of- tune to discuss- these questions when he- has made his financial statement, and honorable- members are in full possession of the details, I say that if the committee intends to make any stand in the direction of economizing in the Defence department, now is the time. We are placed in a very serious position, because, although it is stated that there is to be a saving here so far as Victoria is concerned, as the leader of the Opposition has said, we are all at sea in the matter. If the Commonwealth has taken over the defences of Australia - as in fact it has done - all these divisions, so far as the States are concerned, should be done away with, and the Commonwealth itself should consider what officers are required for the central administration, as well as what officers may be necessary for local administration in the various States. We cannot impress it too strongly on honorable members opposite that these expenses in connexion with the Defence department must be cut down, and there should be no party voting at all in this matter. I hope that the honorable member for Bland will withdraw his amendment and allow mine to be substituted. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we might leave it to the Minister to allocate the various items after reducing the total by £500. The committee will do a good thing if it only shows its determination to have these items under the head of defence cut down. We should get a much more adequate system of defence for a lower total outlay than has been incurred in the past. I think the Minister for Defence might have given us a little more information when he was moving the second reading of the Defence Bill to-day. We got nothing more from him than the bare reading of the clauses of the Bill, and I did hope that on so important a subject he would at least have risen to something like the region of statesmanship and have told us what ideas were actuating the Commonwealth in formulating our defence system. </para>

                    McMILLAN (Wentworth). I think the right honorable gentleman who has charge of the department we are now dealing with might give us some information that would obviate a good deal of this trouble. We all understand that when we have one central administration for defence, the defences of Australia as a whole should be more cheaply provided for I take it that we are simply forming a central department for the administration of the whole of Australia, but that it does not follow that because we are allocating these people to certain offices in the central administration, there will not be a considerable cutting down in the various States.

                        <para>- That will be all right. I think a great deal of this, discussion has arisen out of a misunderstanding of the actual position. I take it that before the Minister tackles the different States with a view to economy, and the reconstruction of the administration, he has first to construct his own central administration and I look forward to enormous economies in the different States when this new central administration is once established. If the Minister would give us . that assurance, there would not be so much trouble, but honorable members naturally look with alarm at officer after officer with, high salaries being provided for in this department,if a similar class of officers is to remain in the different States. The committee do not want to cramp the Government in any way in the administration of this great department, and if the Minister gives us the assurance that by the time the Budget speech is delivered large economies will have been introduced into the whole service, I think it will be satisfactory to the committee. </para>

                    <para>- One of the principal items that was referred to during the Commonwealth campaign - in Queensland, particularly - was our Defence expenditure. I came down from the north nearly 2,000 miles to hear the Prime Minister deliver an address in Brisbane, and that was one of the items which he particularly referred to. He told us that the Defence system of the Commonwealth would be a considerable improvement upon the present system, both as regards efficiency and the general administration. Now what do we find ? That we are to have a Secretary at £900 a year, or £200 ra year more than our commandant in Queensland is paid. Then, again, if we take the whole of the salaries of the officers who are to administer the Commonwealth defences, they amount to very "nearly as much as -we are paying in Queensland for the whole of our little standing army. </para>

                    <para>- Of course the idea is to have, eventually, one Secretary for Defence, but it is impossible to achieve that result at once. It is intended to have a centralized administration, so that instead of having six departments the Commonwealth will only have one. Eventually there will be a great saving, but it is impossible in the first year or two to thrust out into the cold men who hold positions and leave the States to pay them pensions or retiring allowances. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot do that. Defence has been taken over by the Commonwealth. The consequence is that Captain Collins can no longer be Secretary for Defence in Victoria. The honorable member must realize exactly what he is doing. I am sure the members of this committee are anxious to do no injustice to any person so far as it can be avoided. We do not want to have a number of men thrust out of the service so long- as they are able to be useful; nor do we want to have a number of officers claiming retiring allowances, or compensation, or pensions. I am not sure whether this officer is entitled to a pension or not. </para>

                        <para>- That officer retains his £800 a year. I would suggest that those who are responsible for the proposal to reduce the item of £900 should put in black . and white what is to be done. It is quite true that Victoria is relieved from the payment of this salary, but at the same time the officer's services are hereafter to be given to the Commonwealth, and therefore it is the Commonwealth that should pay for them. Of course, Victoria will have to pay her share according to population. </para>

                    (North Sydney).I quite agree with the honorable member for Bland in his desire to object to extravagance such as we have seen in connexion with some of our Defence departments in the different States, and I look with some alarm at any unnecessary defence expenditure. The outlay already incurred by the States has not, as is generally admitted, given an efficient defence to Australia, and that means that a considerable additional expenditure will be forced on the Commonwealth especially in the direction of fortifications.

                    <para>- And armaments also, no doubt.If, in addition to that, we have to multiply the extravagances of the State services it will be an unfortunate thing, for the Commonwealth, and the Estimates for defence will be largely increased. But while I would join with the honorable member for Bland in impressing on the Minister for Defence the necessity for reducing the cost of the Defence forces of the Commonwealth, I am not in favour of doing away with the permanent head of the administrative branch. The better the man we get for the position the more will be saved to the Commonwealth. There should be at the head of the department some officer who can pursue a continuity of policy ; who will not be, like the Minister, here to-day and gone to-morrow, but will be responsible for the success of the policy and for the economical administration of the department. Therefore I do not think that it would be wise to give the position to a subordinate clerk. I am not in favour of the blind reduction of £500 which the honorable member for South Sydney has proposed. If we impress our views upon the Minister, and he promises to attend to the matter and to strive to make a reduction in the expenditure, we ought to be satisfied with that. We should not cut down the item by £500 without knowing how the saving is to be effected. It has been stated that the secretary is to be paid £900 a year, because he has been receiving that salary in the State service. I quite admit that if he is taken over that salary will have to be paid to him ; but at the same time it would be well for the Minister to fix the salary of the position. If not, we know what will occur. This salary will be passed as the salary for the office without anything appearing in the Estimates to show that it is an exceptional case, and it will certainly become the permanent salary for the post. </para>

                        <para>- If the salary is to be £700 or £800, or whatever the Ministry decide is a fair remuneration, why not set it out in the Estimates, and intimate that extra remuneration is given to raise the salary to that which the officer was receiving at the time of transfer? In that way we should have the opinion of Parliament expressed, and we would get rid of any difficulty there might be in the future in reducing the salary to what may be considered a proper level. It must be remembered that if we fix salaries at rates which are considered by the Ministry to be unnecessarily high, merely because of certain conditions or undertakings that have to be carried out in favour of a particular officer, they will regulate all the other salaries in the department, and in that way we shall get a very considerable addition to the expenditure. I consider that the committee ought to know what is supposed to be a proper salary for this position, and when we know that, it might as well be expressed in the Estimates in the way I have pointed out. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence is appealing to the committee on the ground of his little knowledge. Is it that he does not know his department, and that he must have the experience of this officer? It is one of those cases in which a little learning is a dangerous thing. The Minister has informed us that the real reason why he wants the present occupant to continue in office is that he knows too much for the military. I think myself that the present occupant of the office does know too much for, the military. While the Minister points out that every time he makes an order the military people say " That is Collins," I would draw attention to the fact that whenever there has been any gross and disastrous interference with the military and naval forces, and even when the Minister's name has been put t0 that policy, the officers have also had an equal right to say " That is Collins." </para>

                        <para>- It is because a gentleman with a naval title has been able to occupy the position of secretary to the Minister that he has gained the Minister's ear, and has created for himself a power which is really above the Minister. It has been quite unnecessary, therefore, for us to get expert knowledge from England. Time after time this official has interfered, and always will interfere, with the men whose expert knowledge is sought ; he has interfered with the advice they give, and with the naval and military administration of the department. I appeal to the committee to strike out this item altogether. I do so on grounds altogether different from those given by the honorable member for Bland, who does not believe in the office because he thinks some other official could discharge the duties attaching to it. If we are to get expert military advice we should follow that advice, and if the committee support the Minister he ought to have a right to address himself to the expert whom he brings out from England, and to address his military advisers generally, without having to obtain their advice through the channel of the Secretary for Defence. </para>

                        <para>- The Reclassification Board of Victoria, which went into the whole question of salaries, recommended the State Government, of which the Treasurer-was the head, to reduce the salary attached to this office. I think it should also be remembered that when a little while ago we transferred a State officer to a position in the Commonwealth service as one of the clerks of this Parliament, he agreed to take a reduced salary. We should look at the fact that the Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs is only paid £750 a year. If the proposal of the honorable member for Bland is defeated we might make a provision similar to that made in another case where a Clerk of Parliament was taken over at a reduced salary. </para>

I had not that honour, but during the absence of the Minister for Defence I acted for several months. I understood the honorable and learned member to say that I had led him to think - I think he said, I would bear him out, in the statement that Captain Collins had on many occasions interfered unduly with the military commandants. If I recollect the conversation rightly, all I said was that in certain little details, very small sums of money indeed, the. secretary for Defence would give his opinion to the Minister. He never acted as if he was the Minister, and I am not aware that on any occasion the present secretary for Defence guided the policy of any Minister. However, I know it to be a fact that he acted as financial adviser to successive Ministers for Defence, and I am quite sure he saved the State of Victoria thousands of pounds. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think we have in the State of Victoria a more efficient servant than Captain Collins. The Government will have done well if they secure his services as secretary for Defence for the whole of the Commonwealth. I am not now stating whether the salary of the office should he £900 a year. I am very much inclined to agree on that point with what the honorable member for North Sydney has said, that it would be well if the Ministry could state what they think the salary should be, and then, if there is any extra sum, that could be paid to Captain Collins as the new secretary for Defence. I would like to emphasize what I have said with regard to Captain Collins, because Minister after Minister has had the same opinion with regard to him. His position has been a most difficult one ; he has had to act as a sort of buffer between the Minister in his desire to be economical, and the officer of the service, whether military or naval - and I think I might say they were more military than naval in their natural tendency - to be, from a layman's point of view, extravagant. He did not really lay down the policy, but he was simply called upon by the Minister for Defence, perhaps new to the work, and asked if he could effect some economy. </para>

With regard to Victoria, I may tell the honorable member for Maranoa that during the time when we were very short of money indeed, we cut our defences down to as low as we could possibly do. </para>

                    <para>- I think the honorable member for Bland will defeat the object he has in view if he insists upon his attempt to carry the motion. -I take it that his desire is somewhat' similar to my own, and that is not to enter upon a system of complete military control of the defence force. It has been found in other States to be expensive, and, more than that, extravagant. It has been found in Victoria that thousands of pounds yearly have been saved to the Government through the civil system of administration being adopted. I have had some experience in this matter, for I belong to the defence force. Before I had personal experience of the Secretary for Defence I was strongly impressed with the idea that it would be well for the defence force and for the State of Victoria if he were to vacate his position. But later on my eyes were opened, and I frankly admit that my previous opinion had been conceived in ignorance of the duties he had to perform, and also of the circumstances surrounding his position. It is absolutely necessary, in order to keep down expenditure, that the Minister, and not a commandant, shall have control, and the Minister cannot possibly have control unless he has at his service a responsible officer, who has had experience and has proved that he is acquainted with both arms of the service, and is imbued with that spirit of loyalty to the country which is really essential when retrenchment has to be effected. The retrenchments which were effected in Victoria during our time of depression would never have been made had the Minister not had at his elbow, aiding and assisting him, man of very strong personality, who was prepared to do his duty, never mind what the consequences might he. At that time I did blame the Secretary for Defence, and feel that he was exceeding his duty, and that he was not treating fairly the military part of the service, but, on a more intimate acquaintance with his work, I must frankly admit that my first opinion was absolutely wrong. I feel that Victoria had no more loyal, more self-sacrificing, more able servant than that gentleman, and 1 congratulate the Commonwealth upon securing his services. I feel that no one here who has seen the away in which I have spoken and voted on matters of expenditure will accuse me of desiring to see any of the high salaries perpetuated in the Commonwealth. I want to see economy, but in order to get economy we must have men who are capable of administering in an economical fashion. I know from experience that this gentleman is capable of doing so. I do not think we ought to traverse his capacity, because, really, after all, it is the office which the honorable member for Bland is aiming at. He does not impugn the necessity for such a position ;. but I can assure him from my own experience, and from the experience of a large number of men who have occupied the position of head of the Defence department in this State, that it is absolutely necessary, if we are to have due economy, that we should insist upon a certain amount of civil control of the Military department. I am one of those who believe that the people should be prepared at all times to defend the country to which they belong. I believe in a system of citizen soldiery, and I would cut down the standing army or permanent force to the narrowest possible limits; and, in my desire to do that, I would insist upon the Secretary for Defence holding a civil appointment and being an officer who is capable of doing the work which I have indicated has been done so successfully in this State. The Minister has told us that he contemplates the appointment of a commandant from the Imperial Army. What will be the first thing that the Minister will have to do ? He will have to resist the demands for increased expenditure which will be made upon him by this officer, and if he is left at the mercy of a clerk - even though that clerk may be in receipt of £500 a year - he will not be able to do this, and to cope with the responsibility which will be thrown upon him. We must have some one who can advise him, and assist him to offer the necessary resistance. If we do away with the civil control of the department we shall be under military control, and shall be launched upon the sea of extravagance. </para>

                        <para>- I know that that has been the custom. The honorable member for Bland wishes to check the growing spirit of militarism, and to encourage the establishment of a citizen soldiery ; and I therefore wish to impress upon him that to do this, and to prevent extravagant expenditure, we must maintain the civil control of the department by having at its head an officer who is capable of assisting the Minister in keeping down expenses. 1 hope that the honorable member will withdraw his amendment, because I feel certain that he will be able to justify his action in supporting the establishment of this office as an absolute safeguard of the civil rights of the people. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable member for Bland will not press his amendment. I can assure him that I am as fully impressed with the need for economy which exists as is any member of the committee. It is because I believe that the civil control of the defence forces is much more economical than the military control that I support the item. I was very pleased to hear from the Minister for Defence that all the high-salaried positions in the department are not yet filled, and I hope that he will pause before filling them. Indeed, I strongly advise every member of the Government to exercise the greatest care in regard to the filling of new offices. I understood the Treasurer to justify the increased expenditure upon some of the transferred departments upon the ground that there was a corresponding increase in the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- We have not 3-et dealt with the Tariff question, and until we have dealt with it, and have had some experience of the operation of the Tariff, we shall not know what our revenue is to be. Therefore we are at present legislating in the dark, because we cannot take the Customs revenue of the various States as a guide. In my opinion there are more high salaried positions provided for in the schedule than there is any necessity for at the present juncture, and that is notably so in the Department of Defence. I do not think there is any need for three officers at salaries of £900, £600, and £550 per annum each, and I believe that at least one of the offices could be dispensed with. I would impress it upon the Government that, although the committee may vote the items upon the Estimates, a great many of the salaries seem very large to most of us. When I saw that over £1,000,000 was required to meet the expenditure of the ensuing three months, and that some very expensive departments, such as the High Court and the Inter-State Commission, had yet to be created, I was startled ; but in the absence of the fuller particulars which the Treasurer has promised when he makes his Budget speech, I do not feel that any member of the committee is in a position to say where economy can best be exercised. As a word of warning to the Government I would say - " Do not spend £1 more than is necessary in establishing new offices, until we know more as to what our future revenue is likely to be." </para>

                    <para>- I hope that effect will be given to the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney, and that a certain sum will be put aside for this office, and an additional sum voted for the present occupant of it, because it will be incongruous to have public officials receiving salaries of £900 and £1,000 a year, while they are under the control of inspectors receiving only £800 a year. I think that it would be better if we made the salaries something like that which .is to. be paid to the secretary for the Minister for Home Affairs - £750 a year, or even less - and to vote as a separate amount the sums necessary to make up the money now received as salaries by transferred officers. I understand that the chief accountant and the secretary for the Defence department are transferred officers, and that the salaries now being voted for them are only what they have been receiving in the State of Victoria, but I think that it would be better to make provision for them in the way I have suggested. With regard to the other officers in the department, I would point out that probably there are State officers who will not now be required, and whose services could be utilized by the Defence department. I do not want to see new men get these commissions,' if there are public servants of the States who are now drawing State salaries, and who could do the work. The honorable member for Bland has been informed that if Captain Collins does not receive this position he will still draw £900 a year from the State of Victoria ; and if there are other men in the service of the States who will be in a similar position, I think that it would be well to obtain their services for the Defence or some other department. I make these suggestions to the Government, or to the department, hoping that they will be made use of in the appointment of new officers. There is one officer down for a salary of £540 a year, and surely some other officer in the department may well do this work, without bringing in another. </para>

When the honorable member for Bland moved his amendment, I think he stated it was with a view to economy, but it seems to me that his proposal would have quite an opposite effect, for we have been told by the Minister for Defence that if this officer be appointed, similar officers throughout Australia will be dispensed with. </para>

It will be noticed that the amount of increased expenditure involved in the proposal of the Minister is very small indeed compared with the amount of saving that will be effected. A saving of £1,800 will be effected while we shall have to spend something like £900. In New South Wales we shall not have to pay this £900, and the proportionate contributions of the States to that amount would be New South Wales one-third, Victoria two-sevenths, Queensland one-sixth, South Australia one-ninth, Western Australia one-twelfth, and Tasmania onetwentyfourth. </para>

New South Wales will be saved as I say this £900, and I take it that if the honorable member for Bland is faithful to his constituents, he would rather see this one appointment made, which would be a charge on the whole Commonwealth, than keep the New South Wales officer unnecessarily in his place, in order to satisfy an idea that this secretary should not be given to the Minister for Defence. If the honorable member is sincere in his desire for economy he would do well to withdraw his amendment. Something was said in the course of his remarks about an outcry in New South Wales in regard to the.amount that would be expended on the Commonwealth defences. I followed the course of the federal election campaign very keenly, and I do not think there was one word said about the amount of the defence expenditure in accordance with the estimate known as the Adelaide estimate. What was the cause of the outcry in the </para>

                    <para>- I trust that we shall have something more definite from the Minister than we have had up to the present in connexion with this expenditure. I do not' wish to hamper a Minister in his department, but this is the. proper time to speak. The more one looks at these Estimates the more one is struck with the want of uniformity. We find that in one department there are a number of clerks -with salaries ranging from £100 to £200, while in another department the salaries range from £3 2.0-down to £ 1 20. In the Defence department there are five clerks, one at £310, another at £235, another at £200, another at £160, and another at £80. When looking, over these amounts I was very much reminded of the remarks of the honorable member for Gippsland, when he stated from his experience as a member of a Royal commission, which sat in Victoria, that one of the great difficulties was that wherever' a department was created, an effort was made to get as many officers into the deportment as possible so as to give it more importance. That seems to be the trouble from which we are suffering here, each department seemingly differing in importance from the others. What the committee want is an absolute assurance from the Minister for Defence that this is not going to be an increased expenditure - that a corresponding saving, at least, is to be made under the State expenditure. </para>

                    <para>- I have mentioned once or twice that it is not intended that an office shall necessarily carry with it the salary which an officer takes over with him. With regard to this particular office, I think that £750 per annum would be a very fair remuneration. I am not prepared to say that £.750 would be a fair remuneration for the Comptroller-General of Customs, and the same remark applies to the secretary of the Post and Telegraph department. Honorable members might allow this item to pass, however, on my assurance that when I bring in the principal Estimates. I will place in them the salaries which we propose to allot to the various offices. Those salaries, of course, will be subject to the revision of the Public Service Commissioner when he is appointed. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. There is a good 'deal of force in the argument used that if we put down the salary of the secretary to the Minister for Defence at £900, our action may be taken as an intimation to the commissioner that we desire the salary of" that office to be fixed at that.amount. That is not a desirable position, and upon my assurance that when the principal Estimates- are submitted we shall fix what is a fair salary for the various offices, and show the extra amount allowed as extra payment in the case of transferred officers, I think that the item which has been challenged should be allowed to pass. </para>

                        <para>- This £900 must be spent under any circumstances. It really makes no difference whatever. I have suggested a way of getting over the difficult}'. Of course it does not deal with the question which has been raised by the honorable member for Bland, but on reconsideration I am sure he will come to the conclusion that the Minister for Defence must have a secretary. Let me give him my assurance that I believe the retrenchments made in the Defence department in Victoria could not have been made if we had not had the services of an officer who looked at military expenditure from an entirely different stand-point to that of a military officer. We were spending £160,000 in Victoria, and we reduced that amount to £120,000. This year 1 am aware that the expenditure has risen to £220,000, although that is accounted for to a large extent by the number of rifle clubs which have sprung into existence. There is a great outcry that we must have full and efficient defence, but the moment we come to spend money there is trouble about the various details. I have never been carried away with the idea that we must spend an enormous amount upon defence. A large sum of money in my opinion is absolutely wasted, but unfortunately we. have the men permanently in the positions, and it is not so easy to cut them down. The honorable member for Northern Melbourne was right when he suggested that the reduction must be spread over a few years. In New South Wales we have a military secretary and a large ' staff, and we cannot walk in at once and say, " Out you all go." The only way is, when vacancies occur, to transfer some of these officers to other positions, and by that means to gradually make a saving. In Victoria we reduced our military service by nearly one-third. We held out inducements for men to retire, found positions for them in South Africa and Western Australia, and by that means gradually reduced our expenditure. I have had before' me a copy of the departmental Estimates, which I have sent back to the departments with the instruction that they must be largely reduced. Whey they come back to me they will probably suffer another very large reduction. In the meantime, I hope that the honorable member for Bland will not press his amendment to a division. I trust that he will allow this item, to pass, and then when we have the whole Estimates before us, we can deal with the question of what retrenchments should be made throughout " the service. </para>

                    (East Sydney).- I think that the statement made by the Treasurer clears away a great deal of the difficult)' that attends this subject. I am quite prepared to fall in with his suggestion. But the discussion has been a very useful one in throwing light upon one of the greatest difficulties ahead, in view of the scheme propounded by the Minister for Defence to-day. It is evident that the Minister himself really intends to be the commander in chief of all these forces. At the same time he scorns the modern . notion of intercepting buffers between responsible Ministers and great public departments.

                        <para>- I knew it referred to himself, because I know the modesty of my right honorable friend. But although the right honorable gentleman scorns the idea of having any buffer between the responsible Minister and a large public department, it seems that the unfortunate Captain Collins is to be the buffer between himself and the other commanders in chief. That is evidently the position which poor Captain Collins is to occupy. I do not know what will become of him between the different commanders in chief, the Secretary for War and the illustrious general who will come out to be instructed in the art of war, by my right honorable friend, with the help of Captain Collins. I really view the future with some apprehension. But </para>

                    (Bland). - I quite sympathize with those honorable members who say that we ought to have civil control over the military department, and I did not wish, in moving the amendment, to deprive the Minister of expert advice. However, the position when I moved the- amendment was that the Minister had given no indication of his intention to do without expert advice on the civil side in each of the States. Since the amendment was moved, he has given the assurance that he intends economizing on the fines put forward by the honorable member for Wentworth, and, for one, I am satisfied with that. The great objection I had was that there was no indication given, either by word of mouth or in the Estimates put forward, that there was going to be any alteration in the system that at present obtains, but I am quite satisfied with the statements now made, especially with that of the right honorable the Treasurer, that when the Estimates come on we shall have an opportunity of going into matters in more detail. I trust that when the Estimates in chief do come before us we shall find that the office of military secretary in New South Wales has disappeared, and that a number of smaller offices on the civil side have also been done away with. I notice that the Queensland Estimates for this year show that the whole, of their defence administrative work has been carried out by about five or six men, "the head of them getting a salary of £300 a year, for which he acts as chief clerk, accountant and paymaster for a department in which they have an expenditure of somewhere about £100,000 a year. It is shown that they have been able to carry on the civil administration in an economical way. Of course, I am obliged to the honorable member for Robertson for giving me advice out of the vast store of his political experience, and I trust that with all his doubts as to my genuine desire for economy, when the Estimates come on, he will not look with such large equanimity on the military vote. There are 'a number of honorable members who, whilst being strongly desirous of securing increased efficiency in the Defence forces, will not be favorable to any increased expenditure.

                    (North Sydney).- I think that when the Minister for Defence came down with a salary designed to suit, not the position but the officer appointed to a position, he should have been prepared to tell the committee the salary which he thought it desirable to attach to the office. As the Minister did not do so, it was my intention to give him . an opportunity of fixing the amount by moving that the sum of £750 be inserted as the salary for the office. It might even yet be advisable to indicate that to the Minister by motion, but I understand from the Treasurer that he has "undertaken, when, the Budget comes on, to give the salaries for the offices, not only in this case, but in all other cases where the salary of the occupant differs from that attached to the office. Under the circumstances I am quite prepared not to move an amendment; but I think we ought to see, in fixing these salaries in the first place, that honorable members understand what is to be the salary for the office altogether independent of other circumstances.

                        <para>- I think the right honorable learned gentleman will find that he has no right to do that. Inquiry will satisfy him that these officers came over to the Commonwealth upon no such stipulation, and that they came here expecting that they would be put on the same footing as officers from other States where there is no superannuation fund. </para>

The Government has transferred to the Commonwealth from the New South Wales service some officers who, although they were paying into the superannuation fund in New South Wales, claim that they entered the Commonwealth service on the supposition that they would not be obliged to have deductions made from their salaries for this purpose, and would stand on the same footing as the gentlemen who were transferred to the Commonwealth service from the Victorian service. </para>

                    <para>- This is a very useful clause, and one, indeed, that will be absolutely indispensable. When the matter was last before the committee, however, the honorable member for Indi raised a very important constitutional question, which had not occurred to me in drafting the Bill, as to whether this particular clause could in any way be construed as an infringement of the sections of the Constitution Act relating to Appropriation Bills and Money Bills generally. The Attorney-General has been good enough to give consideration to the point, and he has come to the conclusion that it is doubtful. That being so, it is not wise for us to place any clause in this Bill which might give rise unnecessarily to constitutional disputes between the two Houses. The object we have in view can be gained just as well by putting this and the following clause into a separate Bill, and dealing with it before the necessity arises for the Bill to be made law. Under these circumstances, I think it would be wiser to omit both clauses, and later on in the session, I will bring in a short Bill dealing with the subject. I ask the committee to negative this and the following clause. </para>

That would practically be issuing it to the public. As the clause stands, even honorable members cannot obtain that report if it has not been laid on the table, and thus if the House is in recess, information which it is the right of the public to know may not be available for six months after it is ready. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think it would be wise to omit those words. Where sums are voted for salaries or wages, Parliament will pass such votes on the understanding that those amounts, and those only, shall be paid, and that no increased amounts shall be given without its authority. These transfers are generally in relation to small items, where, for example, we have "stores" in one item, and, perhaps, "travelling expenses" in another. If we have a saving in one, instead of having to swell our Supplementary Estimates, with all these odds and ends, we simply transfer that excess to another item in the same subdivision. </para>

                    <para>- I observe that this is the clause which provides that the report shall be transmitted by the Auditor-General to Parliament. If Parliament were not sitting at the time at which it was ready for transmission, the result would be that the Auditor-General would delay the transmission of the report until the House met. That might have the effect of keeping the public and honorable members in the dark for months as to the nature of the report. I want to see a proviso, or words added to this effect - </para>

In the preceding clause the word "statement " is used as referring to a statement of facts, while the word as used in clause 54 evidently refers to the statement to be prepared and signed by the Auditor-General. As the clause is to be reconsidered, I suggest that that matter ought to be attended to. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to support what the leader of the Opposition has been saying on this matter, and also to urge upon Ministers the desirability of circulating other reports. From time to time we get public reports coming to us after the session has opened, when we have other matters to attend to. They do not then get the consideration they deserve, and the country does not get the benefit of the consideration which honorable members might give to them if they were circulated earlier. A complaint of this kind is, I think, made in all Parliaments. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is that the Government cannot well circulate an official document until it has been presented to Parliament. Unless there is an understanding that no objection will be taken to that course, honorable members who are very jealous of their rights may get up and ask why we circulated a report before it was laid before Parliament. </para>

                    <para>- I think the suggestion made is a very good one, and personally I should be glad to have some way of publishing valuable and interesting reports. When the House has risen perhaps for a recess of five or six months, such reports to be delayed and brought forward immediately Parliament meets when honorable members have not the opportunity to study them, as they have their parliamentary duties to attend to. I think the Prime Minister will probably take that into consideration, and unless he has some strong objection to it, he will see the force of issuing copies of the reports to honorable members and to the press in order that publicity may be given to them. I feel that there would be no objection by Parliament to that course being followed. </para>

I can understand that, so far as regards loans taken over by the Commonwealth in the first instance, there is no intention to affect the arrangements of any particular State j but after a loan has been taken over by the Commonwealth it is a Commonwealth debt, and the Commonwealth has to pay the interest. </para>

                    <para>- I thoroughly agree with the proposal which is embodied in the clause that the interest payable, perhaps on the first of a month, in respect to a previous period, should be charged to that period. But since the matter has been mentioned I should like to explain that I was put in a difficulty in New South Wales in two ways ; in one way because my predecessors had always charged interest to the succeeding period, and if I. had altered the practice the effect would have been to make me pay eighteen months' interest in twelve months against the year's revenue, which would have been a very unfair proceeding, and the finances did not admit of it being clone. And further, our Act had not this provision, but had a provision that it should be charged to the period in which it was paid. If I had not done as I did, I should have been first of all taking eighteen months' interest on the shoulders of twelve months' revenue, and then I should have broken the law. The interest is not payable in respect to the first half-year until the 1st July, and the coupons are not presented until then, consequently the actual payment is on the first day of a new financial year and is chargeable to that year. The difficulty arose from the fact that this had been done for a great number of years before I took office, and I had to follow what my predecessors had done. I should otherwise have had to charge my revenue for twelve months with about half-a-million more than it was entitled to bear. I might have done that if we had had a million or two to spare, but we had not. ' </para>

                    (East Sydney). - I wish to refer for a moment to clause 58, if I may. It is with reference to the use of the provision that it shall not be lawful for the Treasurer to expend any moneys standing to the credit of the' loan fund except' under the authority of an Act of the Parliament, which would be an Act specifying certain works. That is a very proper provision in one way. But let us suppose that the Treasurer has in his loan fund a balance, of, say, half-a-million, which he does not immediately require, and that money is extremely dear, and that he wishes to use the money for revenue purposes.

                    <para>- I would like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to a statement in the newspapers to-day in reference to the title of His Majesty the King, and to ask whether the Imperial authorities have requested or have invited suggestions from the Commonwealth Government as to that title. If such a request has been made, and the Government have made any suggestion, will the Prime Minister inform us what the suggestion is? </para>

                    <para>. - -Some months ago, I think in January, a communication 4vas received on the subject. I shall be only too glad to satisfy the justifiable inquiries of honorable members if I find these des-. patches are not marked private. I will see to that to-morrow. If the despatches are not marked confidential, I shall be able to inform honorable members of what has passed. If otherwise, I may ask leave to say -what has passed. </para>
