                    <para>. - I stated to the committee last night that I would draft an amendment to meet the objection taken to that portion of the second sub-clause which refers to the allowance or disallowance of rates aud charges. The objection was urged that the clause did not make it sufficiently clear that the veto of one House would be sufficient to prevent, in whole or in part, rates and charges laid upon the table under Executive authority from taking effect. A further objection was raised that from the present form of the clause it might he thought that a veto of portion of the schedule of rates would be as effective as a veto of the whole. I think I have met both objections in the amendment which I drafted last night, and with regard to which I have since had an opportunity of conferring with the parliamentary draftsman. I think it is wise to adhere to the principle of the clause, and to modify its application. I therefore propose to move - </para>

This proposal is an encroachment upon the rights of the people, which should not be tolerated for a single moment.

                    <para>- I desire to join with those honorable members who have pressed the view that the question of. rates for the carriage of letters and telegrams ought to be dealt with by Act of Parliament, and not by regulation. Regulations, as we understand them, ought to be confined to mere matters of procedure, and not to matters involving taxation, either direct or indirect. The rates for the carriage of letters, newspapers, telegrams, and cables especially, may involve very important questions of policy. For instance, it has already been mentioned that the question of the price to be imposed for the carriage of newspapers will shortly have to be decided as a federal question. I should like to know whether that very important question is to be decided by the Cabinet as an Executive act. I contend that it ought to be determined as a matter of legislation, to' be thrashed out in Parliament. I cannot conceive that any Ministry would take the responsibility of dealing with so important a question merely as a matter of administration, without consulting the Legislature. There may be urgent matters which should be dealt with by Executive regulation, but questions involving the placing of burdens on the people ought to be dealt with by Act of Parliament. I therefore join with those who have already pressed on the Ministry the desirability of reconsidering this clause. It is evident that it has not been reconsidered by the Government, because the Prime Minister has not come down prepared to make any statement, although, I understand, that last night he promised to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It does not. The pressure is always to reduce and not to increase rates. It is not conceivable in these circumstances that a Government would resort to raising postal and telegraphic rates. If there be any doubt about that I shall not have the least objection to making it perfectly clear that these rates shall not be by way of increase. </para>

                        <para>- The experience of countries which have reduced their post and telegraphic rates is that, although there may be an immediate loss, that loss is generally made up in a very short time. That has been the recent experience of New Zealand. I do not say, because of that fact, that we should be justified, in the present financial position of the Commonwealth, in making an Australian penny postage apply immediately. I do not want my words to be misunderstood, simply because I have made that statement. Such a reduction could not be made at the present moment. We must see our financial way much more clearly than we do now before we can make such a change. At the same time, the whole tendency is in favour of reduction, and the result of experience is that these reductions, so long as they are not absolutely too extensive, are at no long period recouped out of extra receipts. A progressive Post-office will keep these matters in mind ; a. congealed one will not. I am not so blind to the signs of the times as not to know that the tendency of officialism is rather towards the crystallization of these matters than in the direction of rapid progress, and if there is a tendency "one way or the other to be guarded against it is the tendency to stagnation. I think this provision. goes in that direction. Reverting to the postal provisions of New South Wales, I would point out that the postage is not to exceed the rates set forth in the schedule to the Act except in certain cases, where arrangements are made with the Postmaster-General of the United Kingdom, or the proper authority of any British possession, and so forth. As far as that is concerned we do not care in this case about the prohibition of any excess, because the tendency is not towards excess. The schedule to the New South Wales Act of 1867 provides that the postage rate upon letters, not exceeding ^ oz., shall be Id. for town addresses, 2d. for country addresses, and 6d. for foreign ; upon letters and packets containing gold, not exceeding 4 ozs., 2d. for town and country addresses, 4d. for foreign and so on. This is the old schedule. Many alterations have been made since by way of reduction. I simply mention the rates for letters so that honorable members will see how the rates stood at that time, and how they have moved since. Section 6 of the New South Wales Electric Telegraph Act 1857, makes it lawful for the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council to fix the fees and dues to be received for the transmission and delivery of every message, and to make all necessary rules. It gives power to recover the fees and dues, and provides that - </para>

But his references to the New South Wales Act were scarcely accurate, because he spoke of many changes having been made in the schedule. The rates for town and country letter's for New South Wales, which form the bulk of the business of the Post-office, have remained at the rate which is in the schedule. </para>

                        <para>- That is a different thing. The New South Wales Act practically fixed the rate at two pence per half ounce f for country letters, and one penny per half ounce for town letters. That was the policy of the Parliament, .and that has remained in force ever since, except that the town radius has been, defined differently. According to the growth of population in different parts of the colony the town charge has been extended to these localities. I regret that the Prime Minister introduced into his statement a remark with reference to clauses 54 and 55 about which I believe there will be a very serious discussion. I, cannot understand the confusion of thought which must have led him to say that he regards those clauses as vital clauses in this machinery Bill because of the constitutional issues involved. It strikes me that some persons may raise constitutional questions as 'to the power of this Parliament to pass such clauses ; but in committee the practical point will be not whether the clauses are within our powers, but as to the policy of introducing them as a matter of machinery into a machinery Bill. , How the Prime Minister can say that he will regard the clauses as vital clauses, does seem to me rather puzzling. It satisfies me that there must be a majority iri the committee in favour of them. It clears up the atmosphere most materially. I see now that the clauses will pass, and personally, I have' no objection. I may not perhaps be here when they come on, and, therefore, I should like to be allowed to say that, so far as I am at present advised, I acknowledge that there is a constitutional power in Parliament to do this, and after giving the matter very serious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the exercise of the power in the manner embodied in the Bill is one which, upon the whole, will be an the best interests of the community. </para>

                    <para>- This provision is a copy of existing legislation - and it is very well understood throughout the States - that loose letters which are posted on steamers and which are not prepaid, shall be surcharged. It gives power to deliver such letters, even though they may not bear postage stamps of the country from which they are sent. This provision has been in existence not only in New South Wales, but in every State I know of for a considerable time. It has been the practice for a long time in Tasmania and elsewhere. Sometimes honorable members may not see the full effect of a clause, but, seeing that this provision has stood the test of time, it is well to insert it. </para>

For example, in Victoria all the agricultural returns which are demanded by the Government Statist, ballot-papers, and votes by post have been sent without prepayment of postage, and I believe income tax schedules too. I would urge that on returns which are demanded by the Government for statistical purposes - agricultural returns, friendly society returns, or matters of that kind - prepayment of postage should not be demanded. I do not know whether it is provided for in another clause; but apparently there is an omission. </para>

                    <para>- The purpose of the Bill is rather to restrict the privileges which have been exercised over freely by various departments, but in restricting those privileges surely honorable members will give to Ministers the latitude which they ask for, in order that under clause 93 they may be able from time to time by regulation to fix the charge or freedom from charge as to various papers and documents which it may be represented to them should be allowed to pass free or at a lower rate. I have numerous letters on this subject from bankers and others who have been in the habit of transmitting a pass-book or other documentary evidence of account, as well as from other persons such as the honorable member has just named. It is desired by the Government that any latitude of that kind should be well considered, and acted upon according to the conditions which may present themselves when the claim is made. So far as it is practicable, there will be a diminution of the- freedom to send free telegrams and free letters. Any special representation to the Postmaster-General will be considered on its merits, as will all other matters which may be necessary in the carrying out of the Act and its efficient administration, and such regulations as will be found necessary from time to time will be promulgated by him after due consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill whether he has taken the power to make such regulations as he has alluded to. In glancing through clause 93 I have not been able to discover that he has taken that power. It would hardly cover an explicit provision to reduce the rate of postage, which I under-( stand he contemplated would be in the power of the Postmaster-General. If he intends to take such a power he ought to expressly ask for it. This clause does not provide for an exemption from postage. It simply says that the sender of the parcel or packet shall not pay the postage, and that it shall be payable by the officer by whom it is received. The request which was made by the honorable member for Bourke, and some others which I think will be made presently, might be very well acceded to. Every facility should be given to those who have to send in statistical, agricultural, or other returns to do so without being obliged to pay the postage. The postage. should be paid by the department to which the return is sent. The sender is asked to do something which it is not to his personal interest to do. A duty is laid upon him by law, and he ought not to be made to pay for discharging that duty. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Postmaster-General will give this matter consideration. The friendly societies are very closely interested in it, because they have to furnish certain official returns every quarter. As their funds available for the payment of contingent expenses are very limited, it will be a serious matter for them if they have to pay postage in every instance. I do not believe in franking letters where they ought to be paid for, but I certainly think that these returns should be forwarded to the Government free of expense to the friendly societies. </para>

                        <para>- It will be evident to honorable members who read this clause that it is the outcome of an effort to restrict the passage of matter through the post without the payment of postage. One instance might be cited of a most extravagant arrangement. In the local courts - not the Commonwealth courts - under certain regulations of the Judges remittances.of sixpence or a shilling may be sent through the post-office under franked stamp, and a, letter purporting to be an acknowledgment of the receipt of the money may be sent also under franked stamp to the person who made the remittance. The purpose of the honorable member for South Australia seems to be to throw the whole responsibility on the Commonwealth of carrying on the work of the local Governments. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the suggestion of the honorable member for Bland will be adopted. I can quite conceive that a number of returns will have to be made in connexion with the statistical branch of the Commonwealth by municipalities and other bodies, and there should be full power given to the Postmaster-General to allow such information to pass through the post without the prepayment of postage. I hope the amendment will be modified in this direction. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to see this clause amended in a liberal way, so that it may provide for the many returns that have to be sent in under the laws of the States, and also for remittances of taxes in the various forms which they assume in the different States. At the present time these are carried free, and why in the name of common sense should the taxpayer now be called upon to pay postage by reason of the Commonwealth having taken over the Post and Telegraph services. Are the taxpayers to bear the charge, or is the State Government, which receives the benefit of the ta.x, to pay the Commonwealth so much on account of the services rendered ? I hope that the clause will be all embracing, and cover every possible return prescribed by law that is now carried free. </para>

I should think it would be extremely difficult to prove in a court of law whether that provision had been complied with or not. . I should like to know the intention of the Government in having these words inserted. There must be some explanation of a definition so wide and possibly so elusive as this appears to bp. . </para>

                    <para>- When a newspaper has been registered as such under clause 27, that will be a safeguard in regard to the transmission of all newspapers through the Post-office hereafter, and the further definition which is given in that clause is to amplify the words "known and registered as a newspaper." I suppose that all of us know and recognise what is a news sheet or a newspaper. When it is once submitted to the Postmaster-General, and a fee of 5s. for registration has been paid, there is the licence for its being so recognised. Then the clause goes on to define what a newspaper should be. The honorable member for Bland, on a previous occasion, gave us evidence of newspapers which were not what he termed wholly or in part newspapers ; but if he will read the clause he will discover that the provision that it shall consist principally of political or other news, together with or without advertisements, governs the whole purpose. The reading of the clause is not that because there are 74 columns of advertisements and 72 columns of news matter, it is not a newspaper, but that because with such a combination of news and principal matter, political or otherwise, it becomes a newspaper. </para>

                    <para>- It is advisable that we should have some definition of a newspaper, and the safest definition is that a newspaper is a publication substantially for the purpose of conveying news to the public. Probably, the words which follow, referring to political or other news, will be sufficient, and the words which are objected to might be omitted ; but I think that some words ought to be retained for the purpose of indicating that newspapers, and not mere advertising sheets are meant. There are a large number of institutions and firms who would like a definition which would include mere -advertising sheets or publications. The committee ought to protect the revenue to the extent of not altering the definition to admit of the wholesale transmission of mere advertising sheets. </para>

                    <para>- Even to meet the objection of the honorable and learned member for .Bendigo, the striking out of these words will carry all the weight which he proposes that the clause should carry, because the paper has to consist wholly or principally of political or other news. It cannot consist entirely of advertisements, and, therefore, I think his objection cannot be sustained. If the Minister in charge pf the Bill says that these words were inserted for a purpose, I would like to know what other purpose they have than that of limiting the definition which is contained in the words "principally political or other news." </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for Bland that it would be infinitely better that these words should come out. The generally accepted sense would vary with different persons. Some publications, for instance, monthly scientific publications, are not known to a great number of persons. The clause merely provides for the Postmaster-General, with no good reasons whatever, saying - "I do not recognise that as a newspaper j it is not a newspaper in the generally accepted sense of the word." The further provisions are the real safeguards, and I think one of them, at any rate, is amply sufficient for the purpose. The first is - </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member or the Barrier has quite unintentionally raised an issue which no doubt ought to be considered in connexion with this Bill, but which I venture to submit ought not to be dealt with here. The clause we have now before us is a definition and nothing else. Its object is one and one only - namely to define what is, and therefore by negative what is not, a newspaper, so that when we come to deal with newspapers hereafter in regard to their registration in the next clause, and in a variety of other clauses, and when we come to determine the postage they are to pay, we may know what is meant by a newspaper, it is here defined. I have not a word to say now in opposition to the remarks made by the honorable member for the Barrier on the general question. There is a great deal to be said in support of his contention that, so far as technical journals are concerned, every consideration should be extended to them by this House; but it is quite unnecessary to call them by any other name or to cause confusion by extending a definition which ought, within reasonable limits, to be as strict as possible. That is why the honorable member for Parramatta, in the light of his experience as a Postmaster-General, was able to see what was desired by this clause, and that there was necessity for the words to which the honorable member for Bland has taken exception, apparently for the good old conservative reason that they are not to be found in existing Acts. </para>

As was pointed out by the honorable member for Parramatta, the object of introducing these words is to provide an additional safeguard so that those publications which are not newspapers shall be referred to under their own names. Then, if this House adopts any special treatment for them, it will know what it is doing. But if we enlarge the term "newspapers" to cover every class of desirable publication, the rest of the Bill will need to be altered accordingly. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the clause deals with coloured supplements proves conclusively that the honorable gentleman has a hazy idea of a trade circular supplement. If we exclude coloured supplements we will not do a very grave injustice to the newspapers of Australia. I certainly think that while it is a good thing to define what is a newspaper, it is also a good thing to define what may be carried on the same conditions as a newspaper. If weight be a consideration, and I agree that it is, let a certain weight be fixed as a maximum, and let us provide that payment shall be made for anything over that weight. </para>

                    <para>- As the Attorney-General has pointed out, this is a definition clause, and one great difficulty is to define what is and what is not a newspaper. I am very much afraid that the words to which the honorable member for Bland takes exception do not define it very accurately. In New South Wales we have had for many years the advantage of free ' newspaper postage. Those honorable members who come from that State and decry the great advantage of the system are gentlemen who, unlike myself, do not hail from the back blocks. They obtain their newspapers in the streets. If they had to live, as I have done, where the postman only comes at irregular intervals, and where we prize our newspapers almost as much as we do the written communications that we receive, they would not cry out against free newspaper postage. It is one of those things that make life bearable in the back blocks, and I should like to see the system continued under the. Commonwealth. The great difficulty in New South Wales has been that a great deal of printed matter not generally recognised as newspapers has obtained this concession, because the publishers have succeeded in complying with, the definition of what - is a newspaper. In Sydney we. have a lot of big business firms who have withdrawn their advertisements from the regular newspapers and are issuing publications of their own, which they have succeeded in making of interest to the country people, and no doubt in a cheaper way than they could do under the old method. Some of these advertising mediums contain very valuable literary matter. Most of them cater for farming requirements, and produce a farming and family magazine, which appeals very strongly to the settler in the back country. No doubt they serve a good purpose, but whether they could come within the province of a newspaper, as regards the rate of postage, is another question. Again, nearly every religious body or political body lias its own organ, which for the purpose of winning adherents is circulated through the Post-office as a newspaper. I do not see how we are going to define what is and what is not a newspaper in such a way as to give general satisfaction. It is a matter which must be left largely to the discretion of the Postmaster-General, but to that suggestion the objection has been taken that Ave may get an interpretation which may be purely political. More completely than any Act of Parliament can make him, the Postmaster-General is its servant, and if Parliament is not satisfied with his administration of that department, it has the remedy in its own hands. I do not see that there is anything to be gained by retaining the words to which exception is taken, because they really :mean very little. </para>

                    <para>- I think that this discussion discloses what little basis there is for the whole thing. We ought to have proceeded with the Bill on purely business lines. If we had done that we should not have to define a newspaper at all, nor should we need the other clauses which deal with newspapers. If the Bill had treated all printed matter alike we should not have all this discussion about trade circulars and newspapers. As a mere matter of common fairness to a large number of the citizens of the Commonwealth, whatever is carried through the post : should be paid for. There is a principle underlying that. But what Ave have been talking about for nearly two "hours has not the ghost of a principle i underlying it. It used to be said at </para>

                    <para>- I would point out that provision has already been made that all foreign newspapers which are duly posted shall be delivered. But if New Zealand likes to send a large number of newspapers for distribution to some agent here we should, in the absence of the paragraph under discussion, enlarge the orders of our postal contractors very considerably. In some of the existing Postal Acts provision is made against the free carriage of stale newspapers. We merely wish to transmit under our postal arrangements newspapers which are printed within the Commonwealth. If a bale of newspapers sent from New Zealand, Fiji, or elsewhere were to enjoy the same rights as are conceded to newspapers posted within the Commonwealth, a great deal of additional work would be thrown upon the Postal department. I do not know whether the committee are seised of the fact that a very large number of our postal contracts cost much more than need be the case by reason of the facilities which are given for the transmission of parcels or newspapers. Many of our inland postal contracts, which might otherwise be undertaken on foot or upon horseback, have - because of the large mass of printed material which is to be carried - to be undertaken with carts, and in some cases a two-horse vehicle has to be employed where a one-horse vehicle would have sufficed. I hope that the committee will prevent more leakage in this respect than has hitherto taken place. We should look forward to the time when the Postal department will pay its way better, in order that increased facilities may be given for the carriage of postal matter at a lower rate. That is the purpose which is aimed at by the PortmasterGeneral. </para>

                    <para>- It is apparent to me that the free carriage of these publications is undertaken in the interests of their proprietors, and not for the benefit of the general' body of the community. The honorable member for Tasmania mentioned that a bale of newspapers might come in from New Zealand, and said in effect that the Post-office would stagger under that sort of blow. This shows the absolute folly of allowing anything to be transmitted by post free. I am not in favour of the amendment. If it is simply in the interests of the proprietors of these publications that they shall be carried free, we ought to acknowledge it, and to say that it is only another form of that protection to which a great many honorable members upon this side of the House are opposed. </para>

                        <para>- Will the honorable member consider this : that the tendency is not to make the carriage of newspapers absolutely free, but to treat them on certain special terms, because they are vehicles of information.If the honorable member takes these other papers, and puts them outside the pale of newspapers, he throws them into the ordinary category of mail material, and he will find that they will thus be charged a great deal more. </para>

Seeing that it has been the law in two or three States for some time, and seeing that it gives a certain amount of encouragement to local writers, the Ministry consider it desirable that the amendment should be made. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Minister ought to decide not to accept the amendment. The Opposition have made no factious interruption of Government business, but have endeavoured to assist Ministers in the passing of their measures. It is not fair to the Opposition under such circumstances to introduce a fiscal proposal into a Post and Telegraph Bill. Under these circumstances, it is not dealing properly with the committee for the Minister to accept a protective provision in a Post and Telegraph Bill where there is no occasion to have any provision of the sort. If the Government desire to deal in their Tariff proposals with this question they can, and that is the proper place to do so. . It will not facilitate the final passing of this Bill.

If the Government choose to make use of their majority to introduce fiscal provisions into this Bill, and force their opinions down the throats of honorable members they will be responsible for the consequences. </para>

                        <para>- One thing at a time. We are providing in the Bill that certain tilings which are deemed newspapers shall be printed and published within the Commonwealth. It would be an absurdity to attach this consequence - that, whereas the paper which is the body, is to be printed and published within the Commonwealth, the supplement which is the tail can come from anywhere else. That has nothing to do with the question whether it ought to be printed on paper made within the Commonwealth. Let us leave that for a little while, and consider it in due course ; and I have no doubt that when it is considered my honorable friends will derive great satisfaction from its consideration. </para>

I am astonished that he should attempt to sneak in pro- . tection under a guise of this character. If the newspaper has to be printed from type set up within the Commonwealth, why should it not be printed with ink made within the Commonwealth ? I might go a bit further and suggest that the wrapper and the mucilage which is used on the wrapper shall be made within the Commonwealth, and to go right back to the. base of protection that the articles shall be written by aboriginals. </para>

                        <para>- I have looked, at the latest Act - the 1893 Act - and I have not found any such provision in it, although that Act was passed when a Ministry was in power which is known in the history of New South Wales as the Ministry which sneaked in protection. If it is right to provide that these stereotypes and electrotypes shall have been made from type set up in the country, why should it not also be provided that the printer's blankets, the printing paper, the ink, and the mucilage on the wrappers shall have been made in the country? I could understand this and similar proposals if we were dealing with the Tariff now, but I object to the sneaking in of a policy to which I am opposed, under the cover of a Post and Telegraph Bill. It might as well be proposed that no parcel should be carried by the parcels post unless it contained goods manufactured in the country, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports might equally well move that the men employed in setting up the type and working the machinery shall receive the minimum wage. I believe that the mover of the amendment is a prominent member of the Australian Natives Association. To carry out his views to their logical conclusion he should insist that all the men employed in the newspaper offices shall be Australian natives. Another objection that I have to the proposal is this : In matters of art we cannot confine ourselves to local productions ; but, if the amendment were agreed to, the proprietors of provincial papers, who, to make their publications attractive to their readers, from time to time issue illustrated coloured supplements, would be compelled, as they could not afford to buy the plant to print them for themselves, to confine their purchases to the productions of the Australian market. I suggest to the Ministry that this matter should be allowed to stand over until the Tariff is dealt with. Victorians are always credited with having their eyes open, but in this instance they did not see that the Opposition were equally wide awake, and would understand the object of the amendment. We are not being treated fairly in this matter, however, because a number of the members of the Opposition are away, thinking that only machinery provisions were to be considered. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable member is not serious in regard to this matter. I protest against the time of the House being taken up with motions that can lead to no good result. It is time that those honorable members who feel that they are enduring a long absence from home took a little part in this discussion. The honorable member for Parramatta has referred to the absence of Ministers from this Chamber. In this connexion I hardly think that Ministers have been fairly dealt with on many occasions. If honorable members will recollect the difficulties which beset the. Government when they took office, and will bear in mind that they had to conduct an election, besides attending many ceremonies and State functions, they will see that more allowance ought to be made for them. It would have been better if this Parliament had not been summoned for six months yet. Then there would have been ample opportunity for Ministers to get their measures in a more: forward state than they could reasonably be expected to do under the circumstances. Until recently they have had no assistance in the preparation of their Bills. I trust that we shall get on with the business because this motion can only result in waste of time. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable member for Parramatta will withdraw the motion, which is practically one of censure of the Government. We had a debate the other night in which as strongly as we possibly could word our language, we deplored the absence of Ministers from the House. We have made our protests, but we cannot compel Ministers to attend in their places, and I think the procedure proposed would be a very unwise one at present. I ask my honorable friend to reconsider his motion, with which I have no sympathy. </para>

                        <para>- How does the honorable and learned member, know that ? Is this a Bill to restrict the distribution of supplements, or is it not ? We do not want to stop newspapers having supplements, but this is simply proposed in order that all the work may be given to local type setters. This is a most extraordinary provision. I do not know why the honorable member if he did not do it for fiscal motives, should have introduced his proposal in this form. The designing work which would give infinitely more work to the States can be done abroad, but before the newspapers send out such supplements they must take care to print something on them. What object is there in that? If the honorable member who has moved this amendment can give me any good reasons, other than fiscal ones, for the adoption of it I may be prepared to support it. If they are only fiscal reasons then what is the position of the Ministry ? Have they not asked us to treat this measure as a non-party one ? Has not that request been responded to ? Have not honorable members on both sides of the committee been seen intermixing in every division? There has been no attempt to make a party question of it, nor has there been any attempt at obstruction on the part of the Opposition. There has been as much criticism from the opposite side of the House as from this. Under these circumstances has not the Opposition responded to the very proper request made to the committee that the measure should not be treated as a party one ? When we have responded in that way why put in a provision in support of which no good argument can be brought forward except for fiscal ones % In these circumstances I think that the Ministry might well see that they are not acting in a fair manner to the Opposition. The honorable mover of the amendment has interjected that this provision is in the New South Wales Act. </para>

                        <para>- I am not particularly concerned with what has been done in New South Wales or any other State. I am endeavouring to do something which, I think, will assist the workers and authors within the Commonwealth. We have been told that we should deal with this question on the Tariff. How can we deal with a postal matter on the Tariff? This is the time to deal with it. Other States have dealt with this question in precisely the same way in similar circumstances, and, as a matter of fact, in precisely the same words. Under all these circumstances I am at a loss to understand the heat and vigour which has been put into the objections raised by the other side. I had no intention to raise the fiscal issue. I had no intention to take an unfair advantage of honorable members opposite ; but because it is raised, and because honorable members choose to take that view, I am not going to withdraw the amendment. I am going to rely on the strength of the Government to help me to cany it. Of course it is always unfair when the minority protest, and it is always right when the majority can carry the proposal. I am with the majority on this occasion, and I believe the proposal is a right one. </para>

                        <para>- What we are seeking to do in the clause is to give special postal facilities to newspapers, as distinguished from other printed matter. But, while we may be willing to give these facilities to newspapers which are printed from plates made in our own country, and therefore, presumably, contain matter of special interest to our people, it does not follow that we should give them to foreign newspapers ; so that, in the ordinary sense of the term, I do not think the amendment affects the fiscal question at all. The carrying of the amendment will not place any extra burden on the people who buy newspapers containing these supplements. </para>

                        <para>- That appears to me to be questionable. In illustration of the statement that the reduction of the cost of production does not guarantee a reduced price to the consumer, I would point out that, although the New South Wales Parliament took off the excise duty from tobacco some months ago, the price of tobacco there has not been reduced. </para>

                        <para>- Not quite. If honorable members object to the stereotypes coming here, they should also object to the paper coming. The honorable member is not qualified to pose as an authority on the printing and publication of newspapers. Of what use is the amendment, unless it is anticipated that large numbers of foreign supplements will be imported into Australia in the future. If the Ministry are well advised, they will recede from the position they have taken up in regard to the amendment;. Even if the committee accept it, is this protectionist morsel likely to be swallowed in another place? We are bound, as practical men, to consider whether another representative Chamber, whose members were elected on the widest franchise possible, will accept a pill of this kind. Honorable members all round the Chamber have hitherto helped the Government with these machinery Bills, and therefore I appeal to them to withdraw their support from the amendment. I have voted frequently with the Government on this Bill, and I hope to do so again whenever they are right. But if they are going to make this question a party one, a good many honorable members who have supported them may have to change their attitude. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the Ministers will adopt the very excellent advice offered by the honorable member for South Sydney. He has pointed out - justly enough - that if Ministers would adhere to their Bill the_amendment would be withdrawn. I cannot but commiserate with the Minister in charge of this measure for having been got at so completely by a protectionist move on the part of the honorable member for Bourke. He seems to have dropped into the trap in the most innocent way. He pleaded that the treason he welcomed an amendment of this : sort is because it would reduce the weight of the matter to be sent through the post. T hope, however, that honorable members by a majority will resist it, and allow us to deal with the fiscal question as a plain straightout issue when the oft-promised Tariff is submitted. I feel strongly that we should do everything we possibly can to secure the circulation amongst the people of the best form of illustrated literature. I believe with the honorable member for Barrier that the homes of the settlers would be made all the happier by the introduction of such literature. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has absolutely condemned the Ministry for the waste of time. We naturally looked upon this amendment as anticipating the Tariff. Who would be the best judge of what was intended in that connexion ? Surely it would be the mover of the amendment, and did he not confirm our attitude when he stated that he moved it for a protective purpose? That being so, there is a breach of faith by the Ministry in stating that this was a non-party question, and allowing an admittedly party issue to be introduced, and standing to it when their own supporters say that it makes no difference at all. There is no justification for the attitude which the Ministry has taken. It is not a proper return for the manner in which they have been treated by the Opposition. We having raised the objection that the acceptance of the amendment was a breach of faith, the Ministry, knowing that this matter could be dealt with in the Tariff, should have withdrawn their support from it. </para>

                        <para>- Is it to be said that Parliament could not1 impose a prohibitive duty upon supplements not printed in Australia? The amendment is a protectionist, move ; but, if I were a. protectionist, I should be ashamed of stopping short where it does. All the protection secured to the Australian workman is in regard to the setting up of a few letters on a supplement. There is no prohibition of the importation of expensive lithographic work which employs so much labour. </para>

We know why they have been carefully omitted from the protected list in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That Act was introduced by a protectionist Ministry for protectionist reasons, but we have been asked to treat this Bill as though it were not a party measure. It has been stated that the free-trade Ministry which held office in New South Wales after the passing of the Act did not repeal that provision, but that was because it had many other important matters to deal with, just as the present protectionist Ministry there finds itself unable to reverse the free-trade policy of its predecessor. I have not dealt with Government measures in a party spirit, but have tried to improve them, and have supported where I could, and spoken as briefly as possible; but the only consideration this side gets is that the fiscal question is allowed to be raised in a machinery Bill, which we have been honestly and fairly treating as a non-party measure, by an amendment which the Prime Minister should have requested his supporter to withdraw. </para>

                    <para>- The views of honorable members opposite seem to vary very much. The Minister in charge of the Bill has told us that he accepted the amendment in order to carry out the intention that the postal service should be conducted on commercial lines, but the mover of the amendment said that he moved it in order to encourage the Australian worker, by which he appears to mean the artisan who sets the type, and not the man who has the brains to compose the literary matter which is printed. Then the honorable and learned members for Northern Melbourne and Tasmania say that there is nothing in the amendment. But, as it has come from a member who sits directly behind the Ministry, the Government apparently do not like to reject it. The Opposition have been twitted with having raised the fiscal question, but we were told by the mover of the amendment that his intention was to raise the fiscal issue. </para>

                        <para>- I do not desire to prolong discussion, but I may point out that the House is responsible for its own standing orders, and that I am compelled in the performance of-my duty as Chairman to see that the standing orders are complied with. The two standing orders dealing with this subject are Nos. 267 and 268. Standing Order 267 provides - </para>

                <para>Standing Order No. 267 clearly provides that a report of any speech during the current session shall not be read, and I take it that the honorable member for Macquarie having assured me that he intends to read a report of such a speech that has been taken down in shorthand, his proposed action comes clearly within the scope of this standing order. The honorable member for Macquarie would be quite in order in referring to anything that the honorable member for Bourke may have said during his speech, and he can reply to him in any way possible within the limits of the standing orders ; but when he proceeds to read directly from a report of the honorable member's speech he is out of order. </para>

                <para>I do not think that that applies to a shorthand note taken by an honorable member himself - that is neither a book nor a newspaper. If. the standing order did so apply it would be absurd and against all usages, and the House would be stultifying itself by assenting to any such proposition until all means are exhausted of coming to some contrary decision. The practice of taking a note either in longhand or shorthand of remarks during a debate to which it is desired to reply, is one which, I am sure, every honorable member in .the State Parliaments and in this Parliament has frequently followed, and I am sure that you will not take umbrage at something like an authoritative ruling being obtained upon this point by referring it to the Speaker. </para>

                        <para>- If we are to go by the literal meaning of these standing orders, the reference which has been made to Standing Order 228 seems to have some point in it. I refer to this because, as leader of the House, I feel myself bound not to take any party side upon a matter of this kind. That standing order means that the committee decides when the Chairman of Committees decides. It seems clear, therefore, that the matter must be settled in the committee, and by the committee itself. Standing Order 227 seems to confirm that view, because it says - </para>

An honorable member cannot bring up a question which Parliament has decided, just as in many Parliaments he cannot introduce the same BUI twice in the same session. But here is a question upon a debate which is pending. The point involved here is whether an honorable member is entitled to get, in any way he chooses, the exact words of a speaker, so as to be able to rebut his argument. </para>

My impression was that you ruled that an honorable member could not quote from a speech which had been made during the same debate. That is the statement with which I disagree.

Upon their face these standing orders appear to provide that no extract can be read from a debate in the same session, even if it were from the same debate. We are told that no honorable member shall read from a printed newspaper or book the report of any speech made in Parliament during the same session. That applies no doubt only to printed newspapers or books which were-the foundation of the original rules of- the House of Commons. Those rules were founded upon the old theory that strangers were supposed to take no part in the debates of the House, and therefore were not to report them.

For the sake of greater accuracy I read a true and correct account of what the honorable member for Bourke stated. I may have used the word " report," but a report is really a statement of what took place. I pointed out that if we are to be debarred from making any reference to the speeches made by honorable members on the question then before the committee, it would place us in a very awkward position. Honorable members, I take it, are only anxious to know the truth of this matter. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members know that I have been, very anxious to make progress to-night, but a discussion, has taken place which has prevented us from doing so - and I say that without casting any blame on members of either party. This important point having arisen, I think it is worthy of the utmost attention, and I am about to propose that we now report progress, although I do not wish honorable members to infer that I am taking that course because I am satisfied with the progress which we have made. I have endeavoured to take a non-party attitude with regard to this point of order, which, in my opinion, hinges upon two of our standing orders. In my opinion, Standing Order 26S refers to extracts from newspapers or other documents commenting on debates, and, therefore, I think we must look for guidance to Standing Orders 266 and 267. The first of these refers, I think, to previous debates, because it says that - </para>

I call attention to the fact that the motion which has been submitted by the honorable member for Bland does not state really the gist of the Chairman's decision. As I understood it, the gist of the decision was that an extract or a report was read, purporting to be a shorthand record, which had not been made within the walls of this chamber, but which had emanated from an outside source.

                        <para>- lam not stating that the honorable member did. The Chairman's I ruling was with respect to a report which emanated from an outside source, and he did not rule that an honorable member could not, read a note of his own or a note taken by another honorable member. The honorable: member commenced his speech by a flourish, of a report, and it was quite open to the inference of the Chairman, as well as the inference of every other honorable member present, that the honorable member had procured that report from an outside source. I think it was quite competent for the Chairman to rule that an honorable member has 'no right to go outside the Chamber for records or reports, and then come down and use them authoritatively. "What I am submitting is. that when this motion dissenting from your ruling is put from the Chair,, care should be taken that the ruling is properly expressed. </para>

                        <para>- Before you put the motion that the committee report progress, sir, I will ask you whether it is competent for you to put it. I understand that the usual practice in discussing dissent from a ruling of the Chairman is to refer the matter to the Speaker, and it may be competent for progress to be reported for that purpose. ' Now you, sir, are clothed with the same authority as the Speaker, and you have a motion dissenting from your ruling. You propose now, on the suggestion of the Prime Minister, to take another motion, which is really an amendment, if it is anything at all, to report progress. If the committee like to allow the Chairman's ruling to stand without interference, that will only follow out the Prime Minister's statement that the House of Commons in the last analysis has the right to overrule the decisions of both the Chairman of Committees and the Speaker, though in practice the House does not exercise that power. We have the power to dissent from the ruling of the Chairman, and the honorable member for Bland has moved that one of the Chairman's rulings be dissented from. Now we are asked to report progress. I am only putting it whether it is in order for the Chairman to report progress when there is a distinct motion before the Chair that the Chairman's ruling be dissented from. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt in my mind on the subject at all. Standing Order 238 makes provision that a Minister can at any time propose a motion that progress be reported. I do not think there is any honorable member, no matter on which side of the House he sits, but will say that in a question of this kind there should be full opportunity for consideration. It is a question of the interpretation of the provisional standing orders. I wish, not only for my own sake, but for the sake of good order in the future, that a little more time should be given for the consideration of the matter. Before putting the motion I wish to repeat - as a misapprehension evidently exists in the mind of the honorable member for Macquarie - that had the statement been made at the time that has now been made by the honorable member I should have ruled differently. I did not far one moment attempt to take up the position that any honorable member was. precluded from taking notes either in shorthand or in any other manner, and quoting from those notes during a debate upon any question. </para>

The telephones are all, or nearly' all, connected with the local exchange, with the result that honorable members desiring to become connected with the central exchange have to wait for long periods until the telephone attendant at the House, who is also the telegraph operator, is disengaged. This sometimes involves a delay of half-an-hour or even an hour. I brought' this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General two months ago and pointed out the inconvenience resulting to honorable members who desired to communicate with the public departments in Melbourne. After the lapse of two months I to-day received a letter from the secretary of the Post-office saying that, after having bent their immense energies to the subject for that period, the departmental officers had discovered that the exchange at Parliament House is connected with the central exchange. They say further that any suggestions 1 may have to make with a view to improving the service will receive consideration, but as I made several suggestions two months ago with the result I have already indicated, I do not feel disposed to take up the time of the postal officials with any more suggestions.

We are told in New South Wales that the Postal department authorities have no funds with which to carry out ordinary works of maintenance and repairs ; but the Treasurer here tells mo that there are funds, ashe has given the central Federal department £9,000 for that very purpose. Notwithstanding this, I have received a letter stating that the department will be pleased to carry out the very urgent repairs required at a post-office in my constituency when there are funds for the purpose. I think that Ministers might strain a point with a view to insuring that the ordinary every-day requirements in connexion with the post-offices shall be met. </para>

                            <para>- The matters that have been referred to will receive attention. With regard to the telephone service at the Houses of Parliament, I have a good deal of sympathy with the complaints that have been made. It is not for me to say in what condition these matters were before this Government came into office, but I cannot help thinking that a good deal is needed to bring tilings up to date. I need say no more than that, because 1. do not want to be unjust to officials. I promised some information last night, which I forgot to give in moving the adjournment of the House. It is this: That on the 2nd August last I caused the following memorandum to be sent by the Secretary for Defence to the military commandant of Western Australia. </para>
