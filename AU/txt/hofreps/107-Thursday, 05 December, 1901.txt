                        <para>- The Government are anxious to give the House the fullest information upon this subject, but the honorable member must realize the great difficulty in obtaining detailed information from the various States in regard to the operation of a new Tariff. A week or ten days ago I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs to let me know upon a Treasury form, which divides the sources of revenue into fifteen or sixteen heads, what amount of Customs revenue has been obtained from the various States, and I hope to get that information in a few days. When I receive it I shall place it at the disposal of honorable members. I have received a promise from the Minister that in future this information will be supplied to me on the second or third of the month, and I shall then be glad to make it public for the information of the House. </para>

That is an error. The understanding under which I left the House was that I was prepared to vote in favour of the 20 per cent. duty as originally proposed. There was a proposal to increase the duty to 25 per cent., but I was not in favour of more than 20 per cent. on any article included in either group of item 57, as was well known to several honorable members. </para>

When one speaks of blankets one generally means something that has wool in it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but only of the very lowest quality. There is a tremendous mixture of articles under this item. I quite recognise the common character of blankets, blanketing, rugs, lap-dusters and rugging, carpets, mats and so on, although even from a protectionist point of view the grouping of these goods together is rather inconvenient. Many of these articles are not manufactured in Victoria, or if they are, only in very small quantities. Then we come to curtains, copies, cushions, furniture, drapery and coverings, bed coversandfurnishings,frillings, rufflings, tuck-lawns, pleatings, and ruchings. From the beginning to the end of this item a tremendous length has to be travelled, and I think there should be some more natural division of the various articles. </para>

                        <para>- I find that £11,959 worth of them were British and foreign produce, and that only £1,666 represented Australian produce. It is quite obvious therefore that this duty is intended to kill revenue and promote the interests of the manufacturers of the eastern States. The men in Western Australia who produce gold, silver, copper, wool, and pearl-shell - who sit on deserted logs, as the Minister for Trade and Customs so humorously pointed out the other night - are to be still further penalized by the imposition of this duty. But the pioneer, who sits on a log without any milk for his tea, and who at night gets into a rug which is taxed to the extent of 20 per cent., may, at the next election, remember the kindness of the right honorable gentleman to him. </para>

                        <para>- I doubt whether he will continue to do so. The right honorable gentleman went over to Western Australia prior to the recent federal elections, and attempted to influence the miners by a very artful appeal. That appeal, however, did not have much effect, seeing that it resulted in the return, by the very men to whom he appealed, of four free-traders. When the Treasurer tells the committee that he must have revenue, it is my duty to point to items such as this in regard to which he is deliberately sacrificing revenue in order to assist some manufacturing monopolists in. the eastern States. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Tasmania does not seem to understand the true significance of the figures which I have presented. I pointed out that£ll,959 worth of the blankets and rugs imported into Western Australia last year, came from Great Britain and foreign countries. Under the proposal of the Government these goods would pay a duty of 20 per cent., whereas the rugs and blankets manufactured in the eastern States would pay no duty. That being so, is it not clear that this impost is intended to give the local article some advantage in the Western Australia market? Why should the Western Australian miners pay 20 per cent. upon this article ? </para>

                        <para>- I have taken the figures supplied by me from the Library. At any rate a duty of 10 per cent., after making all the allowances which the right honorable gentleman would wish to be made, would yield about £13,000 annually. But I submit that blankets are an article of common use, and that in a very severe climate like that of Victoria, it would be a gross wrong to the poorer class to tax them so heavily. Once more I enter my protest against the practice of this Government in burdening at every point the pioneers who are opening up this country, without giving them any compensating advantage. </para>

                    <para>- I must confess to some surprise at finding an amendment in favour of reducing this duty to 1 0 per cent. moved by any honorable member of this committee. It is well within the recollection of all, that only a few hours ago we had a long debate, and a series of divisions, with respect to woollen piece goods, which resulted in the fixing of a duty upon those articles of 15 per cent. It seems to me that blankets and woollen piece goods stand upon precisely the same footing. If an honorable member upon the other side of the Chamber had urged that as a consequence of the action of the committee in respect of woollen piece goods the duty upon blankets should be reduced to 15 per cent., I should not have been so desirous of kicking against a stone-wall as to say that that was not a proper thing to do. But when honorable members deliberately go beyond that, and propose a reduction to 10 per cent. - which furnishes an example of the spirit of compromise that we have seen exhibited in this Chamber upon various occasions - I say that they are unreasonable. If honorable members are going to fights-- </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member asks me if I will agree to a 15 per cent. duty. In other words, he wishes me to allow him to continue fighting, and to stop fighting myself. If both sides of the committee agreed to a reduction of the rate upon this item to 15 per cent. as an amendment consequent upon our action in respect of woollen piece goods, I do not think I could rise in my place and offer any objection. Last night I voted against a reduction of the duty upon woollen piece goods to 15 per cent. If we fight over this item of blankets, I shall vote against the reduction of the rate upon it from 20 per cent. But if a reduction to 15 per cent. is accepted as a necessary result of last night's division in regard to woollen piece goods, I shall not quarrel with that decision. I regret exceedingly last night's decision, and I am satisfied that a reduction of the rate upon blankets to 10 percent. would make it a purely revenue duty, and have the effect of destroying the industry of blanket-making, which is assuming large proportions within the Commonwealth. It is not fair to move a reduction of 10 per cent., and then ask me to consent to 15 per cent., when the honorable member who makes the request is not prepared to abide by the decision. The blanket industry is assuming large dimensions, and so far as first qualities are concerned, we can beat the world price to price, it being in the cheaper qualities that our local product is beaten. It is fail to abide by the decision of the committee, arid we who believe in the higher duty are justified in fighting for our position. </para>

                    <para>- One of the main reasons which induced the States to enter into the Federation was that we were to be customers of each other, and by that means have competition in a large market and secure reduced prices. Under such circumstances the industry could do with less protection, as the larger output would relatively increase profits. We must not assume that, because this article was admitted free in one or other of the States, the Commonwealth should admit it free, or at a mere revenue duty. A peculiar position taken up by the honorable member for Coolgardie is that, by putting on a 20 per cent. duty, we shall sacrifice revenue. That can only mean that the home-made article is going to be used instead of the imported article ; and yet the honorable member tells us that in consequence of the heavy duty the miner will have to pay more for his blankets than otherwise. </para>

We fought the matter out last night, and a decision was arrived at by the committee ; and if the honorable member for Coolgardie is prepared to accept 15 per cent., the Government are prepared to abide by the decision of the committee. We have already decided that woollen goods shall be 15 per cent., and it necessarily follows that blankets must be at the same rate. If that is the feeling of the committee I shall not attempt to discuss the question any further. </para>

                    <para>- It is all very well for honorable members on the Government side who have made up their minds to cry out " Yes," but neither they nor I am supposed to know the minds of honorable members on this side of the House, or the information they may possess. A compromise is a good thing as a rule,, and I thank the Government for making this suggestion at an early stage of the debate. It will no doubt facilitate discussion, and bring it within short limits, but it is not fair at this particular moment for the debate to end. </para>

                    <para>- When we are dealing with an item calculated to bring in £70,000,which will fall on the bulk of the poorer population, it is unworthy of Parliament to rush the item through committee. The suggested compromise is all on one side. We are contending that these articles should be free, and the Government propose a 20 per cent. duty ; and I do not see that it is any compromise to suggest that the duty be 1 5 percent. Unless the reduction is prompted by a sense of the public interest, the Government have no right to suggest it, nor have we on this side any right to accept it merely to save ourselves trouble. On matters affecting the public interest, I know neither fear nor favour, and on behalf of one-third of the people of Australia, who have never had any such duty, I protest against this high impost. I shall have great pleasure in supporting the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie. </para>

By the admission of honorable members, it is impossible to manufacture here low-priced blankets which would compete with the English article. They say that here we can manufacture only the higher priced article, and to protect the manufacture of that article they wish to place a duty of 20 per cent. upon the blankets used by the poorer classes of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I have a recollection of the leader of the Opposition stating at Wellington that his free-trade theories would have to disappear as the price of federation. A duty of 15 per cent. upon an article such as blankets is a distinct compromise between a revenue duty of 10 per cent. and a protective duty of 20 per cent. It may increase the price of blankets temporarily to some extent, but it will also give some encouragement to the local manufacturers of blankets. The Government are to be praised for having let us know how far they intend to go, and thus taking an attitude which should have the effect of shortening debate. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member for Wentworth, when speaking just now, referred to me in language that was very offensive, and which I think he will, in his calmer moments, regret. I have been for over 21 years in politics, and so whatever my shortcomings as a politician, I have been fairly successful ; I cannot say the same of the honorable member, because in the New South Wales Parliament he for a long time represented a party of one. With regard to his remarks upon the question before the Chair, I would direct his attention to what happened in regard to an importation of blankets made on behalf of the New South Wales Government. These blankets were imported under a free-trade policy. Hearing that they were inferior to Victorian, I obtained two sample ones supplied to the Victorian Government, and compared them with the New South Wales imported ones, also submitting them to experts. The unanimous opinion was that the Victorian made were the much better value, and these were manufactured here under protection. The imported English blankets were indeed so bad that, as I interjected just now, they were scarcely fit for black fellows, and, as a matter of fact, were largely given to the blacks. I recognise that no long debate should come from this side of the Chamber, and therefore I shall not say anything further on the matter ; but, considering the attitude which the Government have taken, </para>

                    <para>- Recognising that the Ministry are in a somewhat repentant and conciliatory mood, and that it is desirable to perform our work with expedition, I shall content myself with a very short protest against the proposed 15 per cent. duty on blankets. My policy throughout the federal electoral campaign was in favour of a reduction of duties. The 15 per cent, duties which have hitherto been levied in South Australia have proved a burden to the people, and have not encouraged the manufacture of blankets in that State. Out of the total importation of £13,428 worth of blankets into South Australia, £12,962 worth came from the United Kingdom. Not only has protection been a failure in South Australia, so far as the manufacture of blankets is concerned, but also in Victoria, otherwise Victorian blankets would have been found figuring very largely in the imports into the other States. It has been argued that because we have imposed upon woollen piece goods a duty of 15 per cent., we must levy a similar impost on blankets, but I fail to see any relation between the two articles. The protectionists asked for a duty on woollen piece goods on the ground that the duty would result in the reduction of the local price. If such be the case the necessary margin between the price of the raw material, woollen piece goods, and the manufactured article, blankets, would be created by the lowering of price which, according to the protectionist theory, would take place. But it is very evident that it is not anticipated that there will be any reduction in the prices, because they now say no margin is allowed by the relative amounts of the duties. The two protectionist theories, therefore, are destructive of one another ; and for that reason, and because a duty of 15 per cent. has been found burdensome in South Australia, and has failed to encourage the local industry, I shall support the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Government has met the matter very fairly. There is one piece of information which may be of some use to the committee and which may influence them in coming to a decision. Only lately a proposal came to me from my representative in London that he should supply ship's blankets for the use of our steamers, because he would be able to send out fairly good blankets at such a low rate that we might allow the passengers to take them on shore with them. To my mind, that is an indication that the industry here deserves some protection, and I hope the Government proposal will be agreed to. </para>

                    <para>- An honorable member has remarked to me that he does not understand why Western Australia should take any particular interest in this item, but I may tell honorable members that there are very few nights throughout the whole year in Western Australia on which blankets are not absolutely necessary for comfort. Whilst I am prepared to accept the Government's proposal for a 15 percent, duty with regard to the better quality of blankets, I think they should consider that a very large number of people, and particularly those scattered throughout the remoter parts of the country, use the commoner brown and blue blankets and bushman's rugs, and that the duty on these articles might very well be reduced or remitted. If this were done it would be welcomed by a large proportion of the people of Australia, and would tend to adjust fairly the incidence of taxation. I shall endeavour to have this particular description of blankets placed on the list of exemptions. </para>

                    <para>- But I think it was chiefly the blankets subject to the high duty that were imported. With a reduction of 5 per cent. in the duty, the Treasurer calculates that the importations into Victoria will be just one-third more than they were under a 25 per cent. duty. The Government anticipate that there will be an importation of blankets and rugs into New South Wales to the extent of £45,000 per annum, into Queensland of £11,250, into South Australia of £7,900, and into Tasmania of £5,675, notwithstanding the fact that good blankets are made from one end of Australia to the other.' It is apparently admitted that the imported article is superior to that manufactured locally, because, if it were not, such large importations would not be anticipated. Further than this the Treasurer's estimates imply an admission of the truth of what we have urged, namely, that the lower the rate of duty the greater the importation. </para>

I am also assured by the operatives that our decision means disaster to that particular industry. I wish further to urge that there is nothing in the contention that blankets will be made dearer by the imposition of this duty. At the present time blankets can be bought in Victoria just as cheaply as they can be in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- I would point out to the committee that the duty upon carpeting, floor cloths, and mats is practically a revenue duty. Coir and jute mats, which would be included unless specially provided for, are made in some of the States, and therefore I have expressly excluded them. But practically this is a revenue duty, and I have fixed the amount at 20 per cent. for revenue purposes. </para>

                        <para>- But if we lay this rule down in regard to carpetings, we shall be bound by it in, at all events, a large portion of the items where we have pro? posed a duty of 20 per cent. We have tried to distinguish between carpets, fixing some at 20 per cent, and some at 15 per cent. The carpets on which 15 percent, is imposed are mainly used by the masses of the people. No one can tell whether a 15 per cent, or a 20 per cent, duty will give more or less revenue, but my own opinion is that 20 per cent, will give high results, because at the -lower rate there will have to be considerably greater importation to raise the same amount. I admit that there is a class of carpeting which we might fairly deal with in a different fashion. That is felt carpeting, which is used by people in poorer circumstances, and I should have no objection to fixing the duty in this instance at 15 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; I am not disposed to support very high revenue duties, though if it were a question of protection, I should advocate a higher impost. In the event of 1 0 per cent, not being proposed, I shall support the amendment now before the committee. I would suggest that carriage mats - which may be regarded as articles of luxury - ought to be charged 20 per cent. An exception was made of these articles in the State Tariffs, and we might very well follow that example. I should like to ask the Treasurer whether rush mats, such as are made in blind asylums and by the aborigines, are included in this item, because I think we might protect the one industry which is carried on by the original native Australians? </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I may be allowed to try to end the discussion. As I said before, it is very difficult to tell in regard to a purely revenue duty whether 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. will bring in the larger revenue, seeing that a considerable increase in imports is required at the lower rate to make up the amount. I quite admit, however, that there is a fair probability of the same amount being derived at one rate as at the other. With regard to coir and jute mats, I must ask that there be a duty of 20 per cent., because these articles are made here, and, as regards them, I regard this as a protective duty. Regarding the other articles under discussion, however, I am prepared to accept the proposal to make the duty 15 per cent. </para>

                    <para>- I think it would have been better if linoleums had been specially mentioned. I suggest that instead of selecting felt carpets for the lower duty, it would have been advisable to have selected linoleums, a course which would produce a good revenue, and confer a boon on the whole people of the Commonwealth. One of the most objectionable articles in the houses of the lower, middle, and poorer classes, is felt carpet, which is allowed very often to remain on the floor until it becomes a medium for all sorts of diseases. Many people are giving up the use of carpets altogether for the sake of cleanliness ; and in my opinion it would have been a good idea to put linoleum on the free list. Many medical men have referred to felt carpets as hot-beds of disease, and if we cheapen linoleums we shall enable people to have more comfortable and healthy floor coverings. </para>

The Government say that they are ready to go nine-tenths of the way towards meeting the honorable gentleman, by accepting a duty of 15 per cent. upon everything except coir and jute matting; and if he is sincere in his desire for a compromise, I am sure he will go the rest of the way, and accept the terms offered to him. </para>

I have previously mentioned that the other articles which we have been discussing were not made in Australia, and that we were dealing with an entirely revenue duty. Coir and jute mats are made here largely, and there is no reason why they should not be so made. The raw material up to the present time has had to be imported, and therefore the carriage upon it to a very great extent counterbalances the carriage upon the made-up article. One is probably about as much as the other. Indeed, I do not know that the freight on the raw material is not heavier than that charged upon the made-up article. Therefore, we regard it as a protective item, and accordingly I move - </para>

The manufacture of these articles is carried on by a large number of people, who, without the intervention of middlemen, are able to find a market ; and these are the very class of persons who ought to have the benefit of protection. There are homes in the Commonwealth maintained almost entirely by the manufacture of such articles, and we have here an opportunity presented of helping those who are trying to help themselves. Cosies and similar articles afford employment for a considerable number of women and invalid and infirm persons, who ought to be protected from the cheap articles imported from Germany and other countries, where they are manufactured under conditions which we do not desire to see introduced here. </para>

                    <para>- The proposed duty is very much too high, and it cannot be regarded as protective in its incidence, because such articles as frillings and rufflings are not made to any great extent within the Commonwealth. The compromise offered by the acting leader of the Opposition is a very reasonable one, although I should have been inclined to support a duty of 10 per cent. The articles enumerated here are used principally for making up children's pinafores and aprons, and they should not be subjected to a very heavy tax. </para>

                    <para>- For once I find myself thoroughly in accord with the Government. I wish that they had gone a little further than they have. I think that the honorable member who has just spoken holds a brief for one or two persons who are interested in this industry. It seems to me that if we are to raise revenue at all this is a very proper item upon which to levy a duty. When we impose duties upon the commonest necessaries of life, it is scandalous that we should have a proposal submitted to the committee to allow these valuable furs to come into the country by paying a tax of 3d. per lb. We have already placed enough burdens upon the poor, and I am sure that anybody who can afford to import valuable furs is in a position to pay the duty which the Government propose to collect, and even a much higher duty. Seal skins are not imported very largely. They usually come in in the form of made-up articles upon ladies backs. We ought to get all the revenue that we possibly can from this article. I am aware that the Government anticipate realizing only £1,500 from this duty, but I am convinced that we shall derive a much larger sum from it. Instead of lowering this tax in the way we have endeavoured to lower other duties which bear heavily and harshly on the consumer, we should raise it another 10 per cent., and if the Government make a proposal in that direction I shall support them. </para>

                    <para>- I promised the Prime Minister that I would not speak on this item ; but he will allow me to say that the only question is, what rate will give the most revenue? If the Government think 15 percent, will result in most revenue, this is a class of articles which ought to bear a high duty. I doubt whether 15 per cent, is not too high, but I should not object to the duty if the Government adhere to the proposal. </para>

                    <para>- It is difficult to please everybody, and the Government are not going to try. I am very much amused to hear a suggestion from the acting leader of the Opposition, that it is doubtful whether this duty is not too high, when, if I recollect rightly, on a famous occasion, in an indictment which was made against the Government, an eloquent comparison was drawn, and our iniquity condemned in fixing the duty on furs not so high as the duty on blankets. That was the strongest point in a weak indictment against the Government. The point the Government take, is that the duty which they propose ought to be adopted, or that there should be no duty at all. It is absurd to talk of a duty of 2d. per lb., or1d. per lb., in view of the fact that there was a duty of 2d. in Victoria, with the result that on furs, valued at £4,000 or £5,000 only £39 or £40 was collected. A duty of 2d. would mean only 11/2 per cent. ; and, under all the circumstances, the Government have come to the conclusion to adhere to their proposal.. The Government sympathise a good deal with what has been said by the honorable member for North Sydney. No doubt furs are a luxury, and, while we do not desire to destroy any industry, we think we ought to exact a fair toll on importations. To admit free these undoubted luxuries, which are chiefly or almost entirely used by the rich, is absolutely impossible. As to the idea that if we do not import furs free, there will not be enough business, even in regard to local skins, to keep local tradesmen going, that shows the difficulty some people have in justifying their proposals for special remissions. In regard to the manufactured article, we are allowing a protective duty of 25 per cent., the special definition given to woollens at the conclusion of the division relating to apparel, including all furs. If under these circumstances, the local preparer declares that it is impossible for him to carry on his business unless furs are absolutely free, it seems to me that he is endeavouring to maintain an impossible position, and the Government will adhere to their own proposal. We believe that there will be importations, and that we shall collect a fair amount of revenue ; at any rate, a much larger amount than we would under the rate which has been suggested. </para>

                    <para>- I would specially urge the Government to put a duty of 25 per cent. on seal skins. In South Australia, seal skins are bought from Kangaroo Island, and many years ago I shipped a number which were no larger than one's hand. These were worth 30s. each, but they could not be prepared in Australia. Very recently I priced a lady's sealskin jacket in Melbourne at 70 guineas, and 25 per cent. is the duty on such jackets, so that there is an inconsistency in allowing the sealskin to come in as suggested, or even at 15 per cent. It is only wealthy people who can afford to buy such articles, and there should certainly be a duty of 25 per cent. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree that sealskin jackets are articles of luxury, and ought to bear a very heavy duty ; but I ask that a difference should be made between the made-up article and raw material. In the making up of the latter about 200 people are employed in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Furs of all kinds, but mostly foreign furs. We must have some regard to those engaged in industries, however small their numbers may be. I do not want to shield the rich, and would be willing to impose 50 per cent. on the made up article; but if there be a duty of 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. on the raw material there will be no revenue. All the goods will come in manufactured and, revenue or no revenue, the industry in the Commonwealth will be ruined. </para>

                    <para>- I am a little bit confused by the arguments from the Ministerial side, and I am not quite sure which to accept - those of the Minister for Trade and Customs, or those of the honorable member for Bourke. If the latter honorable member is correct, he does not seem to have made out a bad case from the protectionist point of view. He has. shown that furs are, divisible into a great many classes, some of which are low in. value and form the raw material of certain industries. Furs of high value are used by only the rich, and I do not think the rate proposed by the Government is at all excessive. I did expect to hear from the protectionist side that the duty on furs ought to be still heavier, seeing that importations would thereby be largely diminished, and a demand be created for the skin of the Australian rabbit. </para>

Thousands of working girls have to wear gloves, and, with the low wages which are paid to them, they are likely to feel this tax very severely, amounting as it will to at least 42 per cent., when all the charges are paid. If I thought there was any chance of carrying my proposal I should move to have gloves placed upon the. free list ; but as I consider that hopeless, I move - </para>

                    <para>- It is a pity that no distinction is made between women's and men's gloves. The cheap cotton gloves, worn by the poorer class of women, should be admitted free, or be subject only to a very low duty, but men's gloves should bear a duty of at least 25 per cent., because they are distinct luxuries and are used by the classes best able to bear taxation. </para>

                    <para>- I think gloves may fairly be considered luxuries, and it is not necessary, according to my view, to vary the rates so as to lighten the duty on the cheaper class of article. In the past, Victoria has levied a duty of 20 per cent. on gloves ; Queensland, 25 per cent. ; South Australia, 15 per cent. ; Tasmania, 20 per cent. ; and Western Australia, 15 per cent., and I think our proposal is a fair one. </para>

                        <para>- I shall not enter into that question, but I think we have pretty good evidence that very often a large proportion of the duty is paid by those who sell the articles in the country of export. While the rate may appear somewhat high with regard to the lower-priced goods, I would ask honorable members whether they imagine for one moment that that rate will be operative? Do they imagine that any of the lower-priced goods -will be imported ? And will any honorable member say that lower-priced goods are not sold here at a fair and reasonable price ? </para>

                        <para>- That is the old cry which has been answered time after time. We are told that we must do away with protection, and let the foreigner, after getting possession of the market, raise prices in the absence of competition. We know that foreign manufacturers will not hesitate to spend a few pounds in order to get possession of the Australian market. "The acting leader of the Opposition says that the only object of the composite duties is to cover up the real rates, and throw dust in the eyes of the people. There is no truth whatever in that statement. </para>

Whenever we try to impose revenue duties of 20 per cent., we are asked -to reduce them to 10 per cent., and, when that is found impossible, a request is made to make the rate 15 per cent. In the case of nearly every revenue duty of 20 per cent., attempts have been made to reduce the rate to 15 per cent. This duty cannot be said to be prohibitive, because we expect to receive from it £47,.000 a year. </para>

                        <para>- The purchaser does not bother his head about the rate of duty, but only desires to get a good hat at a reasonable price. The acting leader of the Opposition referred to some hat manufacturing company which he said is paying 10 per cent., and making enormous profits ; and I wish the honorable member would give us a little more information with regard to this particular company. I have been trying to work out the balance-sheet of the Denton Hat Mills Company, to which I think he refers ; and, while I do not pretend to be an expert with such documents, that which I hold in my hand appears to be certified to, under the stringent Victorian laws, by the directors and by the auditor. So far as I can make out there does not appear to be very large profits carried to a reserve fund or hidden away, and I should be glad if the acting leader of the Opposition, who is something of an expert, would give us more information if he possesses it, so that we may know whether this company is really in the position he alleges. Looking over the balance-sheets of this company for the last two or three years, I find that, while there has been an increase in the assets, the liabilities have increased by approximately the same amount. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The Treasurer also said that their average wage was £2 5s. per week. These facts indicates that in Victoria there is already the machinery for manufacturing a larger number of hats than are at present made. When the Pelt Hatters' Association points out that there is scope for the employment of capital in the other States to the extent of £150,000, what it really means is that the manufacturers of Victoria have a capacity for turning out a number of hats, of which, up to the present, they have not been able to avail themselves. The output of four days, or four and a-half days per week is sufficient to supply the market of this State. Consequently, under this Tariff the factories would be able to work full time and increase their output by some 30 per cent. The opinions which I am expressing are apparently held by some honorable members who sit behind the Government. I notice that during a discussion upon this item in 1892, the honorable member for Mernda said - </para>

                    <para>- I know that if an industry happens to be confined to Victoria it offers a splendid opportunity for honorable members upon the other side of the House to attack it. If it pays good dividends they are disposed to give it a harder knock, and if it happens to pay good wages they would wipe it out altogether. They gather their information from goodness knows where, though I am informed that it is made in Germany. I know that statements have been advanced by honorable members opposite during the course of this debate which are absolutely fallacious. We have been told that manufactories have been started in New Zealand, and have succeeded with a 25 per cent. rate. I have the honour to be a member of the Felt Hatters' Union, which is, perhaps, one of the best organized in the world, and I know that never up to the last three months was a felt hat manufactured in New Zealand ; but there have been imported hats, or what we call "bodies," on which two-thirds of the work has been done. There is one factory in New Zealand at the present time which employs three journeymen, who went there in response to an advertisement which was published in the newspapers of Victoria j and I have no doubt that within the next twelve months there will be half-a-dozen skilled artisans employed in that colony. The imports of New Zealand, under a 25 per cent. Tariff, have increased from £46,785 in 1894, to £68,000 last year. There is no wool hat manufactured which does not contain 2£ ozs. of wool, or 2 lbs. of wool in a dozen hats. If it be a fur hat, so much the worse for the arguments we have heard, because fur is worth 9s. per lb. Three or four years ago, the company which has come under the lash to-night, paid the top price of 2s. 6d. per lb. for the best wool at the Geelong sales ; and if 2 lbs. of wool were used in a dozen hats, it is evident that at the prices which have been mentioned, from 5s. 3d. per dozen, labour, trimming, dye, and other material were to be given for nothing. If there are hats sold at the prices which have been quoted - and I doubt the accuracy of the statement - I should like to see the invoices in order to learn whether they did not consist of surplus, stock at the end of the season. I hope I shall not be accused of egotism when I say I have held the highest position in the Felt Hatters' Union in this State prior to entering this House, and, in addition to holding an important position in the English association, I have also been a member of the American union ; so that I have worked under existing conditions in the two countries which produce the greatest number of hats. The English union is so well organized that if we had a protective policy there, and could prevent the importation of hats whenever there was industrial trouble, we could make the wages equal to those which prevail in Victoria ; and that, would mean to the English workman an increase of 100 per cent. That being so, I claim the support of those honorable members who have said they are willing to make the duty equal to the difference in the wages ; and I support the Government proposal, or a higher one, if possible. In the United Kingdom, the minimum wage runs. from 30s. per week in Warwickshire and Leicestershire, to 32s. and 33s. in Lancashire, for 56| hours per week, or an average of 6 dor 7d. per hour. </para>

                        <para>- I happened to be assistant to the general secretary of the English organization in 1894, and lam in correspondence with him now, so that what I say may be taken as absolutely correct. In Victoria, the minimum wage is £3 per week of 48 hours. The Treasurer was wrong when he said that the average wage of felt hatters was about £2 5s. per week. I have the factory inspector's report for last year, and from that we see that the average wage for adult males over 21 years is £2 12s. lOd. per week. </para>

                        <para>- The average wage for an adult female is 19s. lOd. per week. Some honorable members, because the hatters work only four days and a half a week, assume that that condition of things is. peculiar to this State. Rut I can inform the committee that in the Denton district, in England, where the most hats are made, the average this season has been from three or three and a half days in the very best shops, while in others it was as low as two days for month after month. There is a rush before any holiday season, when work is done at high pressure. In Victoria there is the eight hours' system, but this being a season trade, overtime has to be worked at times, just as in England. When the season is over in England no manufacturer will keep his hands employed, because he does not know what shape or colour of hats may be in demand next year. The honorable member for West Sydney asks whether manufacturers are always going to have surplus stocks to send to Australia ; but he must be a very shrewd manufacturer who can run his business to within one week of his turnout in a season. In a shop in which I worked in England, where they turned out 1,000 dozen hats a week, the proprietor counted himself fortunate if he had only 1,000 dozen over at the end of the season. The merchant, . with the usual consideration for himself, returns stock to the manufacturer, who is glad in many cases to get rid of it at less than the cost of making. From one shop there used to be sent every November and May about 1,000 dozen hats to Sydney at a price less than cost. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know ; but there are 21 members of our union there. Honorable members opposite seem to think that the industry could be successfully carried on with lower duties, and the honorable member .for West Sydney said that the Felt Hatters' Association, when it was proposed to reduce the Victorian duty, prophesied that there would be a large increase in the importation of hats. Their prophesy was fulfilled, because the importation of felt hats increased considerably the year after the duty was reduced ; but when the duty was raised to 30s. per dozen it decreased again, though the price of hats was not increased. No honorable member has attempted to show that hats cost more in Victoria because of the duty. Comparing quality with quality, one can get a hat as cheaply here as in any other part of the world. In 1895, the importation of hats was 1,109 doz., but with the reduction of the duty, it increased to 2,708 doz. I find that the average cost per dozen, instead of being that quoted by some honorable members, whose highest figures were £2 9s. per doz., was £3 13s. 4d. per doz., so that, unless the people of Victoria use better hats than the people of the other States, importers paid very dearly for what they brought in. It has been stated that a duty of 15, 20, or 25 per cent, would afford adequate protection for any trade, but, as I have shown, it is possible for manufacturers in other parts of the world to send their surplus stock here for less than cost price, at the end of their season, which is the beginning of ours. But honorable members opposite voted for a duty of 100 per cent. upon an item which concerned New South Wales chiefly. </para>

Most persons think that if they buy hats branded with the name of Woodrow, Christy, Tress, or Lincoln and Bennett, they are getting hats made by those firms, But' the two last-named firms do not manufacture all the felt hats they sell: they purchase them from others. I was offered employment by the firm of Woodrow and Co., but I declined as the minimum wage for the district was 32s. a week, whereas in Victoria the minimum wage for adult male workers is . £3 for a week of 48 hours, the average wage, making allowance for stoppages and holidays, being something like £2 12s.10d. per week. </para>

                        <para>- If you start from nothing, and employ one man] for the first year and five men for the second year, you record an increase of 500 per cent. in the two years, and yet the total result is not worth mentioning. I believe that as the result of duties similar to those now proposed by the Government, hat factories will be established: in the other States, and as hat makers use as their raw material two of our principal products - namely, wool and rabbit fur, we should do everything we can to encourage them. We have been told that a 25 percent. duty added to the natural protection is sufficient to encourage the hat-making industry ; but, I would ask, why is it that not a single hat has been manufactured in Queensland, where they have a 25 per cent duty? A duty of 25 per cent. is not sufficient, and I trust that honorable members will not be misled by figures taken from invoices, probably cooked for the occasion. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for West Sydney has admitted that this is an industry which is worth per serving. It is paying interest upon the capital invested in it, it is providing good wages to its employes/and the conditions under which they work are all that can be desired. Yet the honorable member has gone so far as to say that he will consider the advisability of voting for a protective duty up to 20 or 25 per cent. That is an admission that protection in this instance has done a very great amount of good, because otherwise the honorable member, who is an extreme free-trade representative, would not be prepared to abrogate his principles and vote for a 25 per cent, duty. I desire to know from my honorable friends why they have not such a hat industry in New South i Wales as exists in Victoria ? It is simply because competition without an adequate duty is absolutely impossible. That is borne out by the fact that there have been" no exports from Victoria to New South Wales. The very fact that there is no hat industry in New South |- </para>

The hat I have exhibited is made by machinery from wool, and there is very little hand labour, so that there is no fear of competition from the outside world. We need the duty because we are so circumstanced in Australia - at any rate in Melbourne, and, I believe, in Sydney,. though not to the same degree - that eight or nine |- houses do the distributing for the whole of the State ; and it is well known that unless these houses are compelled by an effective duty to buy from Australian mills and Australian workmen they will go in for indenting and importing. </para>

If the mills were closed tomorrow by a reduction of the duty, every distributing house would import as many hats as possible. We have to fight against narrow, silly, unpatriotic prejudice, and against the preference of distributing houses for dealing in imported hats. It is a fact that the hat industry has not been established in any State of the Commonwealth, or in New Zealand, without an adequate duty. In Victoria there are as many hundreds employed as there are units in New Zealand, or dozens in New South Wales. </para>

The constitution and circumstances of this House are such that I cannot get the duty I would like. This is a fact I recognise in regard to every item, and as to this being a protectionist Tariff, the suggestions of the protectionist conference have only to be looked at in order to realize that they are bitterly disappointed by the Government proposals. Compared with the suggestions of the protectionists' conference, this is neither more nor less than a revenue Tariff. I am convinced, however, that when experience has been gained of the operation of the Tariff in a number of lines, the duties will have to be increased, or the industries will be injured. </para>

                        <para>- I have not said so, and the honorable member knows I do not support deception of any kind. At any rate, so far as I am concerned, I sell nothing but Australian hats, made by union labour. It is argued that these hats are not of ordinary value, and cannot be purchased in the ordinary way. J have nothing to gain by attempting to bolster-up this in- . dustry. I have not a penny invested in the local hat mills, but I know that this is an industry worked by trade unionists, and an industry in which female operatives are paid a minimum wage of 25s. per week. It is because I believe that this country wants more industries of the kind that I advocate adequate duties, though as a matter of fact it might be better for me in my position if the duty were not so high. New South Wales has never attempted to establish the industry by means of duties, but in South Australia they make a common wool hat, never attempting to make fur hats. The fur hat which I exhibited to the committee is made almost exclusively by men who are paid the highest rate of wages and work under the best conditions. </para>

If we have a sufficient duty to insure the home market to the home manufacturer, and we have internal competition, the effect is not enhanced cost, but enhanced value, while work is given to our own people. We have five hat-mills in Victoria, all independent of one another ; and this independence secures good value. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give such an assurance, because I believe that the whole tendency of modern industrial life is towards the formation of trusts ; but I know that the wages paid under trusts are better than the wages paid where there is unbridled competition, and, therefore, in the interests of the workers, I would rather see an industry carried on under a trust or combination than under conditions of unbridled and unchecked competition. I do not think, however, that there is the faintest danger of a trust being formed here. In my opinion, an effective duty will lead to the employment of hundreds of men in the hat industry, both in New South Wales and in Victoria; and it will be to the advantage both of those engaged in the industry and to the purchasers of hats. It does not follow, because hats, boots, ' or other articles of clothing are imported at low rates, that the purchaser benefits. Two years ago a large retail importing house had a large consignment of ladies' mantles sent out from Berlin. I saw a telegram which was sent to the head of the firm, stating that 150 dozen of them would be placed free on board at a price less than the cost of the material, and a letter later on indicated that it paid the people in Germany to send the mantles out here at the end of the Berlin season to prevent them from coming into competition with the next season's goods. But the people who bought . those mantles obtained no advantage, the importer getting 250 per cent, profit upon every one of them. If yo;i compel these' large distributing houses to purchase Australian-made articles, or to make for themselves, they will do so ; but they will never, of their own accord, establish a factory so long as they can import. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Melbourne Ports says that honorable members on this side grudge the profits made by Australian manufacturers ; but that is not so. No one grudges a manufacturer his profit, so long as it is not made at the cost of the State, or of the people of the State. So far as I- am concerned, the hat factories of Victoria or any other place may be as prosperous as possible; and, so far from wishing to injure them, we are attempting to give them full consideration. But we do not wish to give them duties so high that they will be able to levy toll upon t£e people of Australia. The honorable member also said that no importer who had a free port would think of establishing a factory ; but when, during a recent debate, it was stated that three of the largest boot manufacturers in Sydney do not desire a duty, the honorable member declared that those manufacturers were also importers. </para>

                        <para>- The statistics laid upon the table by the right honorable gentleman show it to be so. The honorable member for Yarra complained that honorable gentlemen on this side make incorrect Statements, and found their arguments upon them. But, if I accept the statements of honorable members opposite and deal with them, surely he will have no cause for complaint. The Treasurer has not explained bow much these composite duties amount to per cent. According to the figures of the honorable member for Yarra, who said that the average price of imported hats is £3 13b. 4d. per dozen, the duty0 would amount to about 30 per cent. But it would be very much higher upon cheaper hats, which according to the Treasurer are never imported, the market being - supplied by local factories. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports admitted that the duty on one class of hats is 100 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- That would be 25 per cent. Surely such a lesser duty should be sufficient to guarantee the continuance of the existing factories. It is claimed that the local manufacturers can sell their goods at lower prices than are charged for the imported hats, even without a duty, and if they are sheltered by a duty of 20 per cent., surely they should be able to sell their hats just as readily as at the present time. The Treasurer has asserted that there is a danger of the Australian market being swamped with English goods, and he has stated that Sydney has been swamped because no duties are levied there. "If, however, we impose a duty on hats, there can be do danger of swamping. </para>

                    <para>- We are very much indebted to honorable members for the information which they have given to the committee, and the honorable member for Melbourne Ports is to be congratulated on the way in which he has presented his case. We have to consider what is the proper thing to do under all the circumstances. We find that the duties proposed by the Government range from 37£ to 150 per cent., without taking into account the import charges, which average about 30 per cent, more. Over the greater part of the Commonwealth the duties on hats have hitherto ranged from 15 to 25 per cent., whilst in New South Wales' there has been no duty at all. Under Inter-State free-trade the hat making industries which are established in Victoria will have an extended market for their products, and, whilst I am prepared to avoid doing anything which would unduly hamper them in the carrying out their work, which they have brought to an admirable state of perfection, I cannot consent to the imposition of rates which will give them such a large measure of assistance as the Government propose. It is stated that the hat-making industry has not prospered to such a great extent as it should have done. I have been looking at the balance sheet of the company, which has been previously referred to, and I find that it discloses a thoroughly sound and healthy state of affairs. The balance-sheet appears to have been honestly prepared, but I was somewhat surprised to find that the factory building, which is of large dimensions, is valued at only £1 1,000, and that the whole of the machinery is set down as being worth £4,000. Either the company have been very fortunate in securing their buildings and plant at such a low cost, or they have applied some portion of their profits to the writing down of values. They certainly have made a very good beginning, and if they receive a protection .of a 25 per cent, duty they should be able to profitably exploit the extended market which will now be open to them. That is all the help that I am prepared to give them, and I shall oppose the composite duty proposed by the Government ? </para>

                        <para>- But when hats are imported, which cost only 8s. per dozen, it is impossible for our manufacturers to compete with them and live. I think that the debate which we have had in this connexion has been most interesting and instructive. At various tunes in connexion ' with the question of freetrade and protection theories have been advanced and disputed. The suggestion is that if we impose protective duties the local manufacturer at once raises the price, and the public are plundered. What have we had to-night ? In one of the most important industries we have had men speaking with absolutely accurate knowledge of the subject, assuring every one who heard them that they were simply deposing to actual facts. What is the result ? In Victoria where this industry has been effectually protected, it has been shown that so far from there being any imposition by the manufacturer upon the consumer, good hats are produced at prices which astonish honorable members - prices which by their reasonableness must establish the fact that if we give Australians generally the power which Victorians have had and wisely exercised, we shall have a most important industry' in our midst. If we give to Australia a measure of the protection which has been given to Victoria we need have no fear of the result, because it has been to the intense good of this State in that it has established a most important industry, and the consumers have procured their goods at prices which we could not possibly desire to see modified. We have often heard comparisons instituted regarding different States. I do not wish to indulge in them unnecessarily. But we should be doing worse than wasting our time if we did not institute a comparison between New South Wales and Victoria in regard to this industry ? There can be no doubt that in Victoria the industry has been protected. In New South Wales there has been absolute free-trade. What has been the result? Some honorable n- embers have said that there is not a hat, manufactory in New South Wales, and I am inclined to think that they are about right in the ordinary sense of the term. Certainly they have not a hat manufactory of the character of those which exist in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to think that there is no doubt about it. It is the result of the Tariff and nothing else. If we turn to the official records, we see that even grouping to the credit of New South Wales manufactories, which are really not hat and cap manufactories, but are places of a different character, there are altogether employed in the industry 93 males and 183 females, or a total of 276. On the other hand there are employed in Victoria 430 men and 540- females, or a total of 970. New South Wales requires to import to the value of £220,000 ; while Victoria is satisfied with £150,000. New South Wales has no exports to speak of, £100 representing the export of local manufacture, while Victoria exports between £14,000 and £15,000 worth, of which £10,000 represents local manufacture. Thus we see that there are 700 or 800 people more employed in Victoria than in New South Wales in this particular industry. In Victoria none of those employed are sweated, but they are enjoying the very best of wages. The consumer is not injured, and honorable members have been startled by the facts laid before them by persons connected with the trade. We have been shown that the consumer gets the best article at as low a price as could be or should be obtained in any part of the world. What are the advantages of continuing the system which obtains in Victoria ? If we continue the industry, we continue the employment, and we continue the enjoyment by the public of cheap goods. On the other hand, if we take another course, what will be the effect upon the industry? I do not, perhaps, take quite so gloomy a view as some honorable members ; but when it is proposed to cut down the protection, independent of the fixed duty, by at least two thirds of that which obtains in Victoria, and we are met by the assurance that we are thereby imperilling the industry, I venture to put it that we should not be giving effect to our policy of endeavouring to secure "revenue without destruction" if we did not ask the committee to pause in the interests of the large number of people directly employed, and of those dependent upon them. I do not propose to say anything more upon the subject at this particular moment, but in view of the importance of the question I should, not have been justified in saying less. </para>

The Minister for Trade and Customs tells us that he has put on this duty as an absolutely prohibitive duty. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs said that, although the foreign commodity is shut out, we are getting this particular article cheaper than we should get it if there- were free importation, and he has asked us whether that is not a good result. Now, I should like to know from, the Prime Minister where is " revenue without destruction?" The Minister for Trade and Customs has unblushingly told us that which it was scarcely necessary to tell us, namely, that he has proposed a duty with the absolute intention of, as in Victoria, making impossible the importation of a. certain class of goods. This duty runs up to 134 per cent.; but 1 will take it at 50 per cent. In 1889 there was imported into New South Wales £180,000 worth of hats and caps, which at 50 per cent. would yield a duty of £90,000, whereas the Government expect to receive under this Tariff £20,000. The estimate of the Government shows that 78 per cent. of the importations into New South Wales will be stopped, and, in view of that fact, how much more will be stopped with duties of 100 per cent. or 150 per cent.? This is the most unblushing thing that has been done in the whole course of the Tariff. Never before has a Minister had the temerity to say that the Government have, by this ingenious mode, put on a duty which, instead of being a compromise, absolutely ignores the other States, particularly New South Wales, and shows that Ministers are determined, not merely that certain manufactures in Victoria shall have moderate protection, or not be destroyed, but that the whole of Australia shall be bound absolutely to get their goods from those particular manufacturers. </para>

We could not do anything of the sort. Under the Victorian Tariff, there was £50,000 worth of hats and caps imported, and considering that the. Victorian rate was three times that which is now proposed, I do not see how we can be charged with advocating prohibition. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but if a satisfactory amount of progress is made before that hour I shall not object to an adjournment. When I said that we. should probably have to sit late, I was speaking from a calm retrospection of our proceedings hitherto. If we can adjourn at four o'clock I shall be very happy. </para>
