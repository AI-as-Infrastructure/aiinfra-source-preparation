                        <para>- The State of Queensland is in a very unfortunate position to-day, and will doubtless suffer inconvenience for some years to come, through the great error of judgment which was made by the Ministry of the day in not allowing her to be represented at the second great Convention which drafted the Constitution under which this Parliament has been elected. Many of the inhabitants pf Queensland, and, indeed, many of her public men and the writers in her press, are to-day in comparative ignorance as to what transpired at the Convention, and at the meeting of Premiers which was held subsequently. Western Australia, by being represented in the Convention, was able to obtain concessions which are of vast importance to her, and if Queensland had been represented she also might have done so, and secured the existence of her great sugar-producing industry by maintaining, for a time at least, the existing conditions of labour. We were, however, placed at a disadvantage, because the head of the Government of the day determined that we should not be represented at the Convention, primarily - and </para>

                            <para>- PATERSON.Tasmania is not very much interested in this matter; but all the States which are interested should be represented. It is quite time that the InterState robbery and thriftlessness to which I have referred should cease. The railway authorities of the States have in the past been carrying produce at rates lower than the actual cost of haulage, in order to compete for the trade of their neighbours; and I hope that the Government will take steps to appoint an Inter-State Commission to carry out the purposes for which that commission is provided for in the Constitution, and will see that all necessary powers and authority are vested in it. A minor matter to which I wish to refer is the choice of a site for the federal capital. It has been suggested that the federal capital should -be built somewhere out in the wilderness, amongst the gum-trees which surround Mount Kosciusko; but I think we should not be in a hurry to choose a site. When the Premier of New South Wales was over here the other day, I and other honorable members had a conversation with him about the matter, and we ascertained that he did not regard it as one which should be unduly hurried. It has been contended that the question of climate is a strong reason for selecting a particular site ; but I hold that nearness of population should be a much more important consideration. Most of us come from warm latitudes ; very few of the members of either the Senate or the House of Representatives come from cold climates. ' If Providence spares me to continue a member of this Parliament, I do not want to be sent to a cold climate. I should like the federal capital to be situated somewhere near the sea- - -within an hour or an hour and a half's journey, by the most modern and expeditious electric tramway from some lake or harbor - so that our families may live near the sea when the severe winds of summer are blowing. We all acknowledge that the population of Victoria is at a stand-still. To use the phrase of a squatter, Victoria is stocked up ; it cannot carry any more people. But Victorians need not grumble at this, because their sons and daughters are almost countless in Queensland, and it is their energy and capital which have been the means of making Queensland a second Victoria. In Queensland we have the men and women and the money too. They have valiantly battled with the wilderness in Queensland, as the people in the mallee scrub have also battled with adverse conditions. They are the right sort of people for Queensland. With their capital and their indomitable enterprise and perseverance they have contributed largely to establish the position Queensland at present occupies among the Australian States. As to the federal capital, there is a beautiful piece of land available near Armidale, not very far from the Queensland border. The climate is lovely, and there is every comfort, with plenty of fishing and shooting for those who are fond of sport. It is a moderate distance from Port Macquarie. I think that land should be reported upon before we finally adopt any site for the capital. Though Victoria is alleged to be. standing still in the matter of population, New South Wales has not taken such a very big jump after all. One honorable member last night went back 30 years, and spoke of the early condition of Victoria. I never heard anything so nonsensical. There is no comparison whatever between the position of "Victoria now and then. The comparison was founded upon a most unjustifiable juxtaposition of circumstances. Take the condition, of Queensland when, on leaving Victoria, I entered it in 1861. I do not think that State had 35,000 people then. She now has over 500,000, thanks to Victoria, and to her liberal system of immigration. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not say they would work for that rate of wage. The crassest ignorance prevails concerning the kanaka traffic. Take the evidence of the Royal commission, of which my honorable friend the member for Darling Downs, the ex-Speaker of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, was chairman. The evidence brought before that commission showed clearly that the planters would rather employ white men, and that they employed the nigger or the islander only because they lost by the white labour. </para>

                    <para>Mi:. MACDONALD-PATERSON.- How can this House be a Royal commission ? Is it not the duty of the Government towards members of this House to place us in possession of the latest information from all sides, and to throw all possible light upon the question? We ask that daylight may be let into it. I am not afraid of that, and if that course were taken all Queensland would be prepared to abide by the result. Every planter in Queensland would be quite willing to abide by the result of such an inquiry, and I strongly urge upon the Government that that course should be taken. </para>

                            <para>- The fiscal question occupied no mean position in the discussion by press, public, and politicians, in Queensland, notwithstanding the statement of the leader of the Opposition that the Tariff did not move that State. The question, has moved Queensland very much, indeed, but in a strong silent sort of way - very strong, notwithstanding, the apparent want of agitation and public prominence'. One of the principal reasons for this is that we have- had a drought in some of our regions for from five to seven years. Where there were millions of sheep and cattle, there are now none. Even native dogs and rabbits have diminished, and the people have fled to the coastal regions to wear out their old clothes and live on credit. Year after year we were hoping, against hope, and having been a commercial man for many years, I have invariably felt the strongest interest in every movement connected with commerce and shipping in. Australia. I have had particular sympathy for those with whom I have been so long associated in Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales. The cloud that is over us just now indicates a terrible disaster. As to how it has been brought about, I quote several merchants with whom I have had conferences within the last six or eight weeks. Those merchants have stocked up as usual, thinking the volume of business would, when the rain came, be as before ; and so they have been going on from year to year. Their stocks are now immense - far and above what are commensurate with the wants of the country. Hence they are in great difficulty, and I suppose the renewal of bills and continuation of credit has been resorted to ; but in the meantime they are in very great straits. They are over supplied, and I had a letter this morning expressing anxiety as to what the federal duties may be, and the fear that if the Tariff be less than the existing Tariff in Queensland, it will operate most disastrously to holders of stocks in that State. I am in favour of the Tariff being promptly dealt with, and I am also of opinion that the Government should adopt a half-yearly date as from the 1st July next, or thirty-three days hence, when the duties shall begin, or else leave the matter over until next session and let the duties commence on the 1st of January. The merchants of Brisbane and others who have large stocks in the provincial towns and on the coast, do not want the Tariff for years if they can possibly prevent it. They wish naturally to be able to clear their stocks. Their fear is that the duties will be less than those imposed at present in Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- -I am giving reasons for the early operation of the uniform Tariff. I do not believe it is going to be a very low Tariff - I know it cannot be a low Tariff- - and there will be a good free list, or I misjudge the Government and this House. Pig iron, for instance, is an item on which a duty cannot be put, seeing it is the bed-rock of all industry ; and there are a host of other things which must be on the free list. Any idea of a uniform Tariff of 10 per cent., or 12^- per cent., or 15 or 20 per cent., is nonsense. The Tariff must be a graded Tariff. I remember trying to obtain a copy of the American Tariff, and ultimately I borrowed one from Colonel Bell, United States consul at Sydney. It was as thick as a family bible, whereas the Queensland Tariff could be put on a sheet of foolscap, and so, I believe, could the Victorian Tariff: But I was very much impressed with the manipulation and scientific mode of dealing with certain articles in the American Tariff. For instance, a log of timber which comes into the United States is charged a certain duty, but if that log be squared, the original duty has to be paid, plus a duty on the labour of squaring it. If the log caine in as flitched timber, the duty has to be paid on the original log, plus duty on the labour which brought it into a flitched state. I hope, however, we shall have nothing of that kind in the Commonwealth Tariff, and that the clause on this subject in His Excellency's speech fairly represents the decision of the Cabinet. I am sure they do not want to mislead us. In the speech we read : - </para>

                            <para>- It would increase the business very little indeed, because we have not the distribution of population that they have in Canada and the United States of America. Our telegraph rate in Australia is not one-third of that charged in the United States ; and the charge is lower here than on the Continent of Europe, where it is impossible to get telegrams sent any distance for 3s. the ten words and 3d. per extra word. Indeed, you could not get such messages sent in Europe for twice the money. As to penny postage, I would beg the Government to give the Post and Telegraph department a run of a couple of years at least, and watch the result of Commonwealth administration before any attempt is made to alter the rate. The telegraph rate should be altered and modified, but the postage rate should be twopence. I remember when the postage rate was 4d. between the States ; but my reason for adhering to the present rate of postage is that I think the accounts, if not false, misrepresented the facts. When Postmaster-General for some years I tried to get power to alter the system of accounts, but I was not able to do so. I called attention, however, to the fact that the interest on loan moneys expended by the department - I do not know how it is in other States - are not debited at all. In regard to the railways of Victoria, or those of any other State, the Government can say - " Well, we have earned 3? per cent., and we know that these railways cost 3^- per cent, on the average." But in the Post and Telegraph department of Queensland, I have not found any debit of interest on the cost of the thousands and thousands of miles of telegraph lines and the buildings in the capital and provincial towns. Although the cost appears on the general vote of the Treasurer, the interest never appears on the departmental accounts, so that any honorable member looking at the report of the Postmaster-General or the Under-Secretary, can see only a statement that the loss for the year had been, say, ?166,000, the further loss that lies in the background, represented by the total interest on the moneys expended, being omitted. If we work out the Commonwealth Post-office returns and accounts in the same way as is done in Queensland, the Commonwealth will be building the fabric of cheap postage on an unreliable foundation. This brings me to the great Inter - State railway, which is projected by the member for Swan, and I think I can deal with that measure almost in a sentence. In my opinion, the proposal is fatuous folly, and I wonder the Government have not kept it in check. I suppose it is because the member for Swan has not got used to the collar team, and because the Premier was good enough to overlook the impetuosity of the honorable member's manly character. I believe the cry for a transcontinental railway has done very well in Western Australia, serving, as did the cry about kanaka labour in other colonies, like a trumpet to tickle the ears of the voters. But sane financiers who understand this country will simply say the member for the Swan may blow his trumpet as long as he pleases ; he will not get Parliament to approve of the project. </para>

                            <para>- PATERSON.- I am talking of a principle. I wish it to be distinctly understood that my conviction and the conviction of many others is that the Commonwealth must not begin to make railways at this period of its history. If the construction of this railway is to be the price of Western Australia coming within the Commonwealth arena, then I have a proposal to make on behalf of Queensland. </para>

                            <para>- PATERSON. - That is not the topic under consideration at the present moment. The argument of the Minister of Defence is that the railway will give us our mails so many hours earlier ; but, in these days of cheap cable rates, merchants and others are not so particularly anxious about saving 48 or 50 hours in the delivery of their letters. The importance of such a saving has, to a great extent, vanished during the last ten or fifteen years. But, in coming from Brisbane to Sydney, a person travels twelve hours in the train before reaching the border ; and, when he gets there, he is farther from Sydney than when he started, so that, if the object of the proposed line be to connect the principal cities of two States by a direct route, then Brisbane must have a trunk line also. One travels from Brisbane for nearly fifteen hours before one gets within the distance from Sydney that Brisbane is travelling by steamer through the southern passage. There is a railway that will never carry many passengers. It h a wearisome journey-- </para>

                            <para>- It is not an argument for it. If the primary purpose be to facilitate speedy transit by the shortest route between the capitals of the various States, the work I have suggested is equally - indeed, it is more - entitled to consideration than is the Western Australian line, because it would pass through far better country. It would go through a settled country with plenty of population. I shall conclude my observations with a reference to the Federal High Court.. Some honorable members have decried the early establishment of a federal High Court. I look upon it - and I am sure the great majority of the common sense men of this country also regard it - as essential that this Court should be established as early as practicable. The people look to its establishment as an essential, and they want it established early. I hope, therefore, that when it comes to a question of voting, the Government will have a good majority in support of their proposal. In conclusion, I wish to express my grateful thanks to honorable members for the kindly attention they have given to my somewhat disjointed observations, but being somewhat out of health, I have treated the various points as they occurred to me at the moment. I think, however, that what I have said will give scope for thought, and I trust that my remarks will not be productive of want of harmony between myself and any honorable members who do not quite agree with my views. On the contrary, we are all here, I trust, as loyal Australians - loyal to our own respective States, but essentially loyal to the Commonwealth of Australia - and I hope that the result of our deliberations will be creditable alike to the Commonwealth of Australia and to the various States that have sent us here. </para>

                            <para>- In 1898 Queensland exported to New South Wales 49,000 tons of sugar, and under the New South Wales Tariff a duty of ?3 a ton was paid upon that sugar, producing ?147,000 of revenue. Queensland in the same year exported to Victoria 49,000 tons of sugar, which, with a duty of ?6 per ton, produced ?294,000 of revenue. She also exported to South Australia 15,000 tons of sugar which, with a duty of ?3 per ton, produced ?4.5,000 of revenue, so that the revenue produced by the importation of Queensland sugar into the other States of the Commonwealth amounted to ?486,000. This is no trifling matter, and should not have been passed over without remark by the Prime Minister when he was dealing with such an important question as the fiscal policy of the Commonwealth. I have concluded that at the time of making his speech he had no intention to impose an excise duty upon sugar, though sugar must be considered by free-traders as a fair revenue-producing article.

That the Prime Minister, when speaking at Maitland, had no intention to impose an excise duty upon sugar, appears to me to be manifestly proved by the fact that in his calculation of the financial necessities of the various States he included a sum of a little over ?1,000,000 as the amount which would be lost by the establishment of intercolonial free-trade, and included in that amount is the whole of the sugar duties. The Commissioner of Customs is indulging in one of his characteristic smiles. </para>

                            <para>- When the Prime Minister told us that the loss of revenue by the establishment of intercolonial free-trade would amount to ?1,000,000 per annum, he included the amount of revenue derived from the duties now imposed upon sugar, and that shows me that, however much he may have tried to disguise his policy in regard to the question of excise, it was not his intention to propose an excise duty upon sugar. That fact was probably an inducement to our friends in Queensland to enter the Federation. I put it to the House whether it is a wise or a fair thing to admit Queensland sugar duty free, when at the present time it contributes nearly?500,000 to the revenue of the various States. </para>

I do not say that there should be a heavy excise duty on colonial wines ; but the time is fast coming when our revenue from duties on wines, spirits, and intoxicants generally, will be greatly diminished by the operation of intercolonial free-trade and the increased production of colonial wines, and it will then be absolutely necessary to place excise duties upon colonial wines precisely in the same way as we now place excise duties on colonially brewed beer. What argument is there against the imposition of excise duties on colonial wines, from a revenue stand-point, which would not apply equally to the excise duties we now levy on colonial beer? </para>

                            <para>- It is not a question of protection, but of revenue. It is a question of not losing the revenue upon your Queensland sugar, and the same question will arise as colonial wine becomes more largely used. It will be a matter of not losing the revenue on colonial wine as the consumption of imported wines and spirits decreases. The reason we put on an excise duty in South Australia was that the revenue was falling off, owing to the consumption of colonial beer, and having brought the import duties on spirits and wines almost up to breaking point. The first thing the Government of the day did, having to make up the deficiency in revenue, was to impose an excise duty of 2d. or 3d. per gallon upon all beer brewed within the State. That brought in a revenue of some ?13,000 or ?14,000 a year. In the same way the excise on colonial wine will have to be seriously considered at the hands of this House, unless we are to get into a terribly difficult position with our State finances. </para>

                    <para>Mr.V. L. SOLOMON. - I did not know that beer and wine were regarded as necessaries for the breakfast table in the State the right honorable gentleman represents. It is difficult to know what are the absolute necessities of life. I have heard some argue that sugar and tea were absolutely necessary, and I have heard others say that whisky and soda were more necessary. I will leave the Minister for Defence to decide that point. I know there is an enormous revenue in his State from wines and spirits. I think the revenue per head of the population is something like three times that of the other States of the group - excepting perhaps Tasmania. </para>

                            <para>- That has something to do with it, no doubt. The question is one that can be dealt with in detail when the Minister for Customs brings down the Tariff. I have observed that a question has been raised as to the legality of imposing duties immediately the Tariff resolution is introduced in this House. I very much regret that such a point has been raised. It is absolutely necessary, to prevent trouble, that we should have some means of imposing the duties immediately the resolutions are introduced, even though the payments may have to be made after the Tariff is passed. That has been the course of action adopted in many of the States. Certainly it has been the practice in South Australia ever since I have had anything to do with parliamentary life there, and it is a course of action which must commend itself to any reasonable man. Now, one word as to the time when this Tariff is to be introduced. I think it must be admitted by honorable members on all sides that the sooner the question is settled the better it will be for commerce throughout the whole of the States. Commercially everything is in a state of disorder. Business men are not stocking up as they usually would. The revenue from Customs in many of the States is falling off slightly, owing to the fact that the business community are waiting to know what rate of duty they will have to pay on the various commodities in which they deal. It is, there1 fore, of the very utmost importance that this Bill, which, I believe, the Minister of Customs has been busily engaged upon since the 1st of January, should be introduced at the earliest possible moment. I do not think it is possible for this Parliament to give proper attention to the various other matters included in the Governor-General's speech until the Tariff issue has been settled. I am hopeful that when the Bill is introduced it will be brought as closely as possible to the ideal of the revenue Tariff advocates on this side of the House, and removed as foi- as possible from the ideal of the Victorian protectionists, who have not yet ceased to clamour for further assistance for their local industries. </para>

                            <para>- I am about to deal with that point. Under such circumstances - and I quote this as an illustration of the point I want honorable members to consider - I think the Inter-State Commission would undoubtedly have a right to declare whether it would be fair for New South Wales, having constructed a line from Cobar to Broken Hill, to take the traffic which now travels over 200 or 300 miles to Port Pirie, and divert it over a route of 600 or 700 miles to Lithgow, or any other place in New South Wales, at a freight which would absolutely not pay the Railway department, and would, at the same time, be a distinct injustice to the State of South Australia, which has already developed the border district, and provided the natural channel for its traffic. If so, our federation on this point is a delusion and a farce. </para>

                            <para>- With all clue respect to the right honorable gentleman, I invite the special attention of the Attorney-General and other legal members of the Government - and there are enough of them surely - to the particularly difficult point which has been raised by the honorable member for Northern Melbourne. I now come to a question mentioned by one or two previous speakers- - first of all, I think, by the honorable member for East Sydney - as to the right of the Government to include in its numbers and its deliberations two members other than the seven provided by the Constitution. I have carefully looked into this question, and I have arrived at the conclusion that no such right exists. If outside of this written Constitution - which is a very definite one, and is not like some of the Constitutions in the States - the Government are entitled to appoint two honorary members of the Cabinet to assist in their deliberations, but who hold no portfolio and are not in any way responsible, who cannot be questioned by this or the other House, and whose position is a mere sinecure - why can they not increase their present majority by the appointment of another half-dozen. Some years ago in South Australia, under a provision of the Constitution very similar to that of the Federal Constitution in this respect, there was a similar case in which the Government chose to appoint additional members in the Legislative Council ; and I think I can recall the memory of the Minister for Trade and Customs to the fact that he was one of those who speedily assisted in putting a stop to such appointments. </para>

                        <para>There seems already to be a widespread opinion that every appointment in the Federal Public Service is to be made from the ranks of the public servants in the different States. That is not a good doctrine. There may well be cases in which there are strong and good reasons for appointing persons outside the existing public service. I know of no principle or precedent which limits the appointments in a new public service to those who already hold positions under the various States. </para>

                            <para>- It was suggested by some honorable member yesterday. It has been suggested both inside and outside this Chamber. I am inclined to think that that would involve a very large expenditure, and if we are to study the solvency of the different States we have to consider the question of economy in such matters. I think it would be quite sufficient if a reasonable number of members of both. Houses were appointed a commission to investigate the question. I have no desire to visit these beauty spots myself. Judging by the photographs of them I might be induced to stay at one of them. A reasonable number of members of both Houses might be appointed a commission and might place before this Parliament recommendations as to the best site for a federal capital. Many questions will have to be considered in looking into this matter, and as to some of these a large body of men, say 100, could not obtain information, whereas a small committee could obtain all the information necessary. </para>

                            <para>- Of the advantages or the disadvantages of the projected railway I do not intend to say much. The principle is laid down that Western Australia is entitled to the line asa means of defence. Defence from what? As a means by which to carry bodies of troops when Western Australia is assailed by a foreign power? Surely Western Australia, with her population of 180,000, who, as we have seen recently, are capable of sending fine bodies of troops to South Africa to assist the mother country; with her enormous number of male adults, strapping fellows, on the gold-fields, capable of being enlisted at any moment - does not want the assistance of a few regiments of soldiers to be carried over a railway line for a thousand miles from Port Augusta. The arguments relied upon on the grounds of defence are absurd. I do not care what military authority first thought of it, I say it is an absurdity to build a line of railway to cost, at the very lowest estimate, ?5,000,000, over a barren sandy tract of country. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to dispute about the track now, but I say that if there was any justification for this line, apart from considerations of defence, you should take it over a tract of country which might possibly be developed for its mineral resources, and from that point of view might make the line pay. But the course proposed to be taken is certainly a great deal further to the north. It is proposed to construct the line on a direct track from Port Augusta, taking in. the Tarcoola country, and so on to the Western Australia border. But I am not going to discuss that until we have areport from those capable of reporting upon it. If, as the Minister for Defence says, this country is capable of development- </para>

                    <para>It is difficult to make even an approximate estimate of the revenue to be received ; but after discussing the matter very fully with the General Traffic Manager and Controller of Accounts, and on this assumption that the Western gold-field will prove fairly permanent, I think that if the West Australian Government would continue the line from the border to connect with their system, the receipts would probably amount to ?85,000 per annum, and the existing lines would benefit from the increased traffic to the extent of ?27,000 per annum, less ?9,000 for working expenses, equal to ?18,000. If the line was to stop at the border, of course the expected revenue would not be anything like as here anticipated, but with a through line to the gold-fields there is every reason to think that not only a large passenger, but a good traffic in merchanise and live stock would result. </para>
                    <para>Then he goes on a little later to say - </para>
                    <para>As regards the working expenses, the revenue estimated for could be earned by the running of four trains each way per week, and on that basis I put the annual expenditure at ?50,000. It will thus be seen that the excess of earnings over working expenses on the new line represents 1.84 per cent. on the capital cost, or if the net additional on the old line is included, the revenue is ?53,000, representing . 2.79 per cent. on capital cost. </para>
                    <para>Then he puts it that the interest at 3 per cent. would be ?60,000, so that the general revenue would be taxed to the extent of ?7,000 by the construction of the line. </para>

                            <para>- The proposal is to continue the line from the Port Augusta line, which has a 3ft. Gin. gauge, and join it with 'the lines of Western Australia, which are also of 3ft. 6in. gauge ; but if this transcontinental line is for passenger traffic, it will have to be constructed on 4ft 8 1/2in.. gauge at least. It will be necessary for the rest of the line in South Australia to be brought to the same gauge, and, under these circumstances, the estimate of ?2,000,000 for the 553 miles of railway is very much under what it ought to be. </para>

But recognising the financial position of the State I represent, I am not, at the very inception of federation, going to countenance any public works which are not likely to become reproductive, or, at least, return sufficient to repay interest on the cost of construction. </para>

It is a question I have studied very closely since the Maitland speech of the Premier, and when it is placed before us by the Government as a national undertaking, I am rather inclined to compare it with another and a truly national undertaking, that would merit the consideration of Parliament. I am inclined to make the comparison, and give members of the House a little certain information about another district which should be served. </para>

                            <para>- I alluded a few moments ago to the desirableness of the Federal Government taking over the Northern Territory, and I pointed out that South Australia as a State had very reasonable claims to consideration in this matter. I also pointed out the danger to federation of South Australia being forced into the position of abandoning the Northern Territory, or handing it back to the Imperial Government. When honourable members talk about a railway as a national work to join all parts of this great federated continent, I venture to think they have forgotten there is a line of railway constructed from Adelaide in the south, to a point called Oodnadatta, in the centre of Australia, or nearly so, and that at the northern end of the State there is a line of railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek, a distance of 150 miles, and that a line of railway between these two points, for a distance of 1,100 miles, would serve to join the whole of the southern portion of the continent with' the northern territory of South Australia. I have heard nothing to recommend the tract of country to be tapped in Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>-Mostly Chinamen, as the right honorable member says. Over the whole tract of country there have never been more than about 2,000 Europeans, and yet during the eighteen years from 1881 to 1898, gold to the valueVof ?.1,487,000 has been produced by this handful of population. In addition there have been produced ?48,000 worth of silver, 23,000 worth of tin, and ?55,000 worth of copper - a total of ?1,670,000 worth of mineral in the period I have mentioned. These figures are from the sworn records at the Customhouse, and do not account for the tens of thousands of ounces of alluvial gold taken out privately by individuals when there was an export duty on that mineral. </para>

                            <para>- No, I have not; but I believe the return for last year was ?60,000 or ?70,000 worth. But population in this tract of country has been gradually decreasing, and naturally the output of minerals has also somewhat decreased. In regard to the difficulties in the development of those minerals - the reason for winch the member for Swan is so anxious to know - I would say that; while to his particular country - and I say "his." advisedly - European labourers and others can get from any of the other States to Western Australia for a charge of two or three pounds, and reach a place where there is ample opportunity to obtain employment, any man seeking to get to the Northern Territory has to choose between travelling. 2,000 miles or overland travelling nearly 4,000 miles by sea, at the lowest cost of about ?1 2 ; and, should he have any bad luck, he cannot get from the North under another ?12. Then, again, the distance of the northern, mining district from the directors and shareholders in the various companies which have provided the capital, has proved a very big drawback. When they get to water-level, about 250 feet deep, the inflow of wetter is very much like an underground river. When I tell honorable members that, with a 60-in. rainfall in the tropical portion of that country, at 300 feet from the surface it requires at least two 12-in. draw lift pumps to cope with the water, they will understand what expenditure is necessary in machinery to enable that country to be developed. </para>

This tract of country is 500 miles in width, and I may here remind honorable members that from Adelaide to Port Darwin we have our duplicate telegraph line by which the whole of Australia obtains its European: intelligence every morning. At Port Darwin we have a harbor with a rise and fall of 26 feet high-tide springs, a harborsome- 6 miles in length by 4 miles in width, capable of sheltering the whole British fleet, and manoeuvring, them, too, without the slightest fear of a collision. On the shore of this harbor we have the two cables landed connecting. Europe with Australia. Some honorable members talk about the defence of Western Australia with its 160,000 or 180,000 people. Is it not more of a national undertaking that a railway should be constructed across this tract of country to join the southern half of South Australia with the northern, so that we may be in a position to protect that telegraph line which is of vital importance to the whole of Australia, and to protect those two cables on the shore ? </para>

The cables landing at Port Darwin are also worthy of protection.

Within six or seven days' steam of that port is China, within seven clays' steam is Japan, and within four and a half days is the Malay archipelago. Will honorable members say that a railway to this port for defence purposes, for our interests in telegraphy communication, and to connect Pout Darwin, which is nearest to the position from whence we may expect trouble and danger - the East - is not more justified and more entitled to a place in the policy of the Barton Government than is this railway to Western Australia? </para>

                            <para>- So far, coal measures have not been discovered,, but the Rev. J. Tennyson Woods, a very noted geologist, many years ago, when visiting this country, reported upon the extreme probability of the discovery of coal measures in the Victoria River district, where the sandstone formations are very- similar to those in some portions of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Like other honorable members who have spoken, I feel a certain amount of diffidence in presenting any views I may have in regard to the matters referred to in the Governor-General's speech to this House. I also feel a high sense of the honour it is to be a member of this first Commonwealth Parliament, and to take part in this its first debate. I join with the honorable member for Parkes in congratulating the House generally upon the tone of nearly all the speeches that have been delivered. We have had some of very marked ability, and very few indeed which have been characterised by any acrimony or bitterness in tone. We are making therefore, I think, a very excellent start, and I trust that as honorable members become more acquainted with each other, and get a greater knowledge of the different States, we will improve even on the good start we have made. The matter which dominates me as a member of the House, is one upon which I feel a very great and keen sense of responsibility not only to myself, but to the House generally. We are here starting a new nation, with a territory of 3,000,000 square miles - as large an area as Europe - and the immediate future must depend very largely indeed upon how we make a start. Therefore, I feel that we need all the wisdom we can possibly have, we need consideration for each other, and we need moderation in the expression of any views we may put forward ; we need toleration ; and for myself I feel that I need a very great deal of education in regard to the various matters which will be discussed. We do not want any cocksureness. Speeches have been delivered by honorable members sitting on the opposite side of the chamber who seem to be cocksure in their opinions. These honorable gentlemen do not seem to think that there can be any modification or refutation of their views ; but I hope that if they listen to what is said by honorable members on this side they will see that there is a very great balance of truth in the views which we hold. We must recognise that a very great responsibility has been laid upon the shoulders of those who compose the Commonwealth Ministry. If our responsibility is great, a still greater responsibility has been laid upon them. We should recognise that they feel this responsibility, and should give them our generous assistance. I would, therefore, very strongly deprecate any carping criticism. These gentlemen have a great task to perform, and I hope that honorable members will give them their hearty and generous support, and that there will be no party or personal squabbling. It seems to me that the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor-General is a very honest one. Its statements are .to some extent indefinite ; but has any honorable member ever known a speech of the kind which was more definite. These speeches contain only the outlines of the proposals which are to be made by the Ministry, and, as they have a good many fathers, they must express a good many views. Ex-Ministers who have prepared similar speeches know how difficult it is to frame them, and will probably agree that the speech before us is quite as definite as any they have heard before. It seems to 7ne that, looking at the present position of matters in the various States, our first duty is to reconcile the interests of the States. We are practically all of one race and. of one religion, and, though our interests are somewhat diverse, we have this great advantage, that we have no feuds, and nothing in the shape of racial hatreds or enmity between one part of the Commonwealth and another, to deal with. We have no past wrongs to right, and there should be no bitterness between the residents of the different States. When we consider how other federations - the federation of the United States, of Canada, and of Germany, for instance - were formed in the face of conflicting interests, bitter racial hatreds, and differing religions, and remember how much better situated we on this continent are, we should be ashamed not to try to make this the greatest federation on the face of the globe. But that can be done only by translating the term " Commonwealth " into action by recognising the rights, the interests, and the duties, not only of our own State, but of all the States of the union, both great and small. The great duty which devolves upon the Government and upon Parliament is the duty of developing our country. We have an enormous territory - some 3,000,000 square miles, nearly one-sixth of the globe - we have good soil and a genial climate, and we have within our borders resources which should lead us to the very highest point of development. Our advantages are as great as those possessed by the United States when they federated, and we have not their drawbacks. We have a country of magnificent distances and opportunities, and I hope that the House, instead of wrangling over theories and abstract questions, will apply itself as soon as possible to the development of our territory. We have our land to cultivate, our rivers to lock, our mines to develop, and we must give employment to our people. But I noticed that a very important omission was made, both from the Prime Minister's Maitland speech, and from the Governor-General's speech, nothing being said about this need for development. I communicated my views about the Prime Minister's Maitland speech to the Attorney-General, so that he knows what mv mind is on the subject. We must develop our country. AVe are going to impose upon the people a certain amount of extra taxation, and we must do all we can to let them earn as much as, and a great deal more than, will make up for this extra charge. It is stated in the Governor-General's speech that inquiries will be made with reference to the practicability of certain railway proposals ; but there is another question which has not been referred to during this debate, and which should have the early attention of the Government and the Parliament, and that is the utilization of our great rivers, our streams, and our water-courses. I represent a district in the northern part of this State, where the people have been suffering for seven or eight years past from a serious and prolonged drought. One can scarcely estimate the losses of stock and crops which have occurred through the drought, or the loss which the colony has sustained by the removal of a large number of people beyond her boundaries ; and when we go further north, and consider the condition of things which has prevailed in the western districts of New South Wales for the last five or six years, we find that what has occurred there is, if possible, even worse than what has occurred in our own State. During the "last five years over 30,000,000 sheep have perished in New South Wales for want of water, and the losses of stock through drought during the last fifteen or twenty years must have been so great that I am sure they would have paid, five or six times over, for such works as would have absolutely prevented them. Therefore I say that this matter should have the early attention of the Government. I do not say that we should start at once to construct water conservation works; but we should immediately set about making inquiries as to the possibilities of the utilization of our streams. We have streams in the north which for a great part of the year are noble rivers. They arena navigable for five or six months in the year, but, for the rest of the time, the steamers are laid up, and the men are idle. There are no natural obstacles to the locking of these rivers, so that they may be made nanavigable for the whole year, and will give us a supply of water for the irrigation of the surrounding country, and I think that the Government might at once take in hand the collation of all the information that has been gained on the subject by the various States. I am speaking now not only for the State of Victoria, and the State of New South Wales, but for every State in which water' conservation can be carried out. Both States have already done a great deal in this matter. They have sent engineers through the country, and have collected an enormous amount of information. This information could be tabulated, and the gaps filled up, so that when the time comes for the Commonwealth to take action, as it must surely come if we are to develop the country, no time will be lost in carrying out works which will be of incalculable benefit to the community. </para>

                            <para>- I am not sure how far the Commonwealth can go in the matter, but I think we shall have to follow in the lead of the United States in regard to it. There they have been for years fully seised of the enormous value of their streams and water storage areas, and have utilized them to the fullest extent, making thousands of miles of desert to bloom and blossom as the rose. In the United States they have been carrying on a hydrographic survey over every portion of their territory. They are getting the fullest information with regard to every point, and they are taking advantage of this information as fast as they can. In this way they are settling their people on the land, and are creating what we require in this country, absolute permanence of occupation, because they give the settlers a good permanent water supply. I do not know how far the Commonwealth can go in that respect. </para>

                    <para>Of meat preserving, sugar mills, sugar refineries, saw mills, smelting works, and docks and ship workers, and I do not think that any of these industries owe anything whatever to the Tariff. Meat preserving in New South Wales employs 1,509 hands, as against 747 hands in Victoria ; the sugar mills in New South Wales employ 1,038 hands, as against 240 hands in Victoria; the refineries employ 450 hands in New South Wales, as against 307 here ; saw mills employ 3,004 hands in New South Wales, as against 1,467 here; smelting works employ 3,339 hands in New South Wales, as against 71 here ; and the docks. and shipping yards employ 1,240, as against 110 in Victoria. In those six industries there are employed in New South Wales a total of 10,580 hands, as against 2,942 hands in Victoria ; and when we add this difference in favour of Victoria we find a total of 4,326. It is shown that Victoria has in purely manufacturing industries 1.1,962 more hands employed than are employed in New South Wales. These figures are from the New South Wales statist, and there is no -going beyond them. Honorable members from all parts of Australia must have been .greatly struck by that magnificent Eight Hours' Day procession of workmen a week Or 'two ago. Nothing approaching that procession could have been shown in Sydney ; and when we remember that in the same procession the friendly societies brought out their thousands of members, numbers of whom would otherwise have been with the workers, it may be imagined what a magnificent gathering it would have been, had it been a trades' procession only and representative of the manufactures of this city. New South Wales has had other advantages beyond those enjoyed by Victoria. As the honorable member* for Gippsland pointed out New South Wales for the last ten years has had from land, loan revenue, minerals, and wool, ?100,000,000 over and above the sum Victoria has had from those sources, and she has been bolstered up in her finances by the way in which she obtained loans and by the way in winch she used the money. During the term of office of the present leader of the Opposition as Premier of New South Wales - and I think the honorable member for Parramatta was associated with him in. his Government, and, therefore, I am not chary of making reference to the matter in the absence of the leader of the Opposition - that State obtained in loans ?9,500,000 as against ?1,350,000 obtained by Victoria. New South Wales received in rents and purchase money for land ?12,000,000 as against ?2,700,000 received by Victoria. But the worst feature was that the New South Wales loan money was not spent on productive works, but on works of an unreproductive character, thus saving the pockets of the people in regard to taxation, and making it appear that New South Wales was in a very fine financial position. </para>

                            <para>- No. From 1895 to 1899 New South Wales used loan money for unproductive purpose to the amount of ?3,485,497 -my figures come from the New South Wales statist - while Victoria during the same term used for the same purpose - a bad purpose I admit, and we were offenders to some extent - the sum of ?724,920 only. Members on the other side, knowing that no extreme policy is possible, endeavour to drive the Government to extremes, and twit them with not standing out for protection, and with not showing their faith in that policy by putting on heavy protective duties. But do the members of the Opposition not recognise that they are on the horns of the same dilemma themselves, because they are not prepared to stand by the policy of free-trade, but are sheltering themselves under the title of " revenue tariffists?" The leader of the Opposition said he had come to Victoria to give us some plain speaking, and that he was going to give us the naked truth only; but honorable members will get as much plain speaking from the Government side of the House as from the other. The leader of the Opposition boasted here of the financial position of New South Wales under his regime, and of the condition in which he had left the finances when he resigned office. I have shown the way in which New South Wales loan moneys were used, and though I do not know the whole details of the transactions which took place in New South Wales during the regime of the right honorable gentleman, I do know that the leader of the Opposition presents the only case of a Treasurer of an Australian State being called to account, and having a committee of public accountants, quite disassociated from politics, inquiring into his finances and bringing in a damaging report. We need safe men in the Commonwealth, and especially we need safe men to guard our finances at the present time. I believe we have those safe men. We do not want Micawbers, and will not have them at any price. The leader of the Opposition, and those who think with him expressed great sympathy with the farmer, and proposed to knock off the "shackles" which they say are fettering the farming industry. But in what way did the honorable member's Government treat the farmers of New South Wales? They knocked off the modest 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. duties, which had been imposed by the previous Dibbs Government, and called upon the farmers to pay a land tax instead. For the three years 1897-8-9, there were imported into New South Wales no less than ?6,800,000 worth of farm, dairy, and orchard produce, the great bulk of which could have been produced by the farmers of that State, but which they did not get the chance of producing, because of the fiscal policy. On fourteen articles of ordinary farm products in common use - potatoes, oats, barley, onions, hay, chaff and straw, butter, cheese, flour, preserved milk, oatmeal, dried fruits, currants and raisins, bran and wheat - which any farmer could grow, there was imported into New South Wales in three years ?3,939,951 worth. That was the friendship shown to the farmers ; that is the way in which farmers were assisted by the leader of the Opposition and his Government. </para>

We hear free-traders talk free-trade at random, but we have never yet, in any Australian State, had a free-trader with the courage to put his principles into practice. Without having regard to. existing conditions, protectionists are asked why they do not insist upon protection if it be a good thing ; but why have free-traders, in all these years, not had the courage to put their principles into practice in the form of pure, unadulterated free-trade? Because they knew that the people would not stand it, because they knew it would spell ruin to their various States. </para>

                            <para>- Another fallacy which, like all free-trade statements,, is constantly repeated, despite the logic of facts, is that protection increases the price of every article to which it is applied. That is not a fact. Although protection increases the price of some articles, it does not increase the price of- other articles: Where protection is -applied reasonably .and- wisely to the manufacture of articles the raw material- of'- which is produced within- the State, the result is to cheapen those articles to the consumer; but if duties are imposed without discrimination, for the advantage of every one who chooses to ask for them, you must have a state of affairs which would justify. the statement which I am refuting, </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The debate on those duties did not conclude until the Government had promised to appoint a Royal commission to inquire into the state of our industries and the working of our Tariff. To show how justifiable were the protests made by the Attorney-General, myself, and others, who considered themselves sound protectionists, I may mention that when, after sitting two years, that commission, a majority of its members being protectionists, brought in its report, it recommended that 31 duties on the Tariff should be left as they stood, that 25 duties should be increased, and that 86 should be reduced. After a long and protracted discussion, extending over several months, when every item in the Tariff was carefully reviewed and fought over - more carefully, I think, than the items in the proposed Commonwealth Tariff will be dealt with - 81 duties were reduced, 21 were increased, and 23 new duties were imposed. We have been told that in Victoria protection has run mad, and though it did run mad here for a year or two, we have come to our senses, and are now clothed and in our right minds. It is a policy of reasonable and moderate protection that I intend to support in the settlement of the Commonwealth Tariff. To show that we have not an unreasonable Tariff in Victoria, I may state that out of our ?1S,000,000 worth of imports ?12,000,000 come in free. Would not an all round 15 or even 10 per cent, duty tax the people infinitely more than an average of 14-4 per cent., which is the amount of our present duties ? It is difficult to account for the venomous antagonism to manufacturers shown by some free-traders. Men come to a new country like this ; they put their money into industries ; they run the risk of those industries not being a success ; they have no guarantee from the State that they will succeed, but all they ask is to be put under fair conditions with regard to those engaged in the same industries in, other parts of the world. Yet they are hounded down as robbers who are imposing burdens on the people of this country for their own sole benefit. I have not found those manufacturers of ours to be so enormously wealthy as has been said. They have made a living, but that is about all. I do not know that they live in mansions or palaces. The people who live in such places are the bookmakers and the' merchants. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. We know that the importers as a body are not particularly favorable to protection. The merchants want to buy a thing for a shilling, and sell it for ls. 9d. Then their minds are easy and they have their stocks to fall back upon. Our manufacturers have been spoken of as " marauding bands," and the employes in our factories as paupers. That is the language of honorable members who come to this State to endeavour to arrange a Tariff that will be satisfactory to all. classes in Australia. It seems to me that this country will not grow if we are to be content with simply making raw material. Surely, if we can take the raw material which we produce, and make it worth ten times its original value by working it up into finished articles, it is better that we should do that here than send the niaterif.il to other parts of the world to be manufactured ? </para>

It seems to me the height of absurdity to send raw material from this State to be made up, and then import it back again for our use. Suppose that in a certain district we raise produce to the value of ?100,000. For raising that produce we need implements and other tilings. If we send for these things to foreign countries, what is the effect? We get them, but we lose a portion of the ?100,000, which goes to build up the industries of other places, and which finds employment for the people there. But if we can supply the goods for the raising of that ?100,000 of produce from the labour of our own people, if we have those goods made up in our own country, "we have two capitals working; we have two sets of men engaged; and we have two profits making. We keep the capital in the country, make the double profit in the country, and we are enabled to send out of the country for goods which we cannot produce here, to a larger extent than we could otherwise do. </para>

                            <para>- It seems always a puzzle to free-traders that under a protective Tariff imports do not decrease. They do not decrease because the country is making more wealth, keeping its money within its borders, and sending out more goods than it otherwise would do. The honorable member for West Sydney said in his speech last week that protection in America cannot have been a success because they are importing ?137,000,000 worth of goods of one kind and another. The reason is that they are wealthy enough to import and pay for those goods. Another reason why we should endeavour to encourage industry is that we are thus enabled to keep control over our own trade conditions. In this new country, we do not want to have our working men beaten down to the rates of wages that are received in other countries - England as well as elsewhere. If we have free-trade we have no control over labour - no control over the production of the articles we use. But if we produce them in our own country, we can fix a fair rate, we can control the market and the trade conditions, and regulate the employment of labour so that men get a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. I hold that no country in the world is so prosperous as where the people are fairly remunerated for their employment. My honorable friends opposite would ask what competition it is that we have to fear. A friend of mine, who is well known in commercial circles in Melbourne, desired to open up business with Japan. We know there are hundreds of thousands of cotton spindles working there. The Japanese are taking up the various branches of western industry. They are adept and clever, and will, before many years, under their new conditions, prove formidable competitors to all their western rivals. My friend instructed his agent to make inquiries as to the rates of pay in Japan as compared with those for corresponding positions in Victoria. He found that engineers in Japan received lis. a week for doing work for which from ?4 to ?4 10s. a week was paid in Victoria. Workmen receiving from 25s. to 40s. per week in Victoria were paid from 5s. to 7s. a week in Japan, and those receiving 15s. to 27s. per week here received from 2s. 6d. to 4s. a week there. My' honorable friends opposite would open our. ports and our people to competition like that, from a country only three weeks sail from our shores. </para>

                        <para>Now, what is free-trade ? or let us rather say, what ought free-trade to he ? Free-trade, iu its fullest sense, in its ideal meaning ? The term " free-trade " in itself has a certain charm to the ear ; it sounds ideal, and it is ideal, or, rather, it is an idea that ought never to have been formed into the much abused and much misunderstood term "free-trade;" that misrepresents its real1 meaning. Free-trade is an equal opportunity for all to trade in perfect freedom on an equal footing, without favour and without restriction, with each other, unhampered . and unassisted, so that: the ablest shall have the best chance and may prosper. Slavery has had its day ; so has freetrade. Free-trade, means at present slavery for England ; it means that foreign nations are free to import unrestricted their own goods and to shut out ours. But it means- even- more than that. It means an invitation and a grand opportunity for our foreign rivals to ruin our own-trade and industries, and, therewith, the. working classes, without any fear of retaliation. </para>

                            <para>- I agree that by going round a little distance you could go to Eucla, The people of Kalgoorlie will be satisfied to have a railway constructed by the State of Western Australia to Eucla, rather than have this matter set aside by the Federal Parliament. Give them a port at Eucla, and you will find that the construction of the large works at Fremantle and along the Swan River as far as Perth - most expensive and injudicious works, if I may express that opinion, when a natural harbor exists at Owen's Anchorage - will be unnecessary. If you spent some money on the bar there you would have a harbor to be proud of I know that countrywell. </para>

                            <para>- I shall wait to hear the report, and if it can be shown that it is a work advantageous from every point of view, I shall be in favour of the line, but I will not vary my decision to give my vote in favour of a railway to the Northern Territory. The enterprise of the people of South Australia is to my mind greater than the enterprise of the people of any other of the Australian colonies, because years ago they constructed the transcontinental telegraph line, when the people of other parts of Australia were afraid to touch the project. It may be said they now receive some reward for their enterprise, but it must be remembered that this was an enterprise that had failed repeatedly. If the South Australians had not been men of real " grit," devotion, and determination, this line would never have been constructed, and Australia would not have held the position she holds to-day. </para>

                            <para>- I shall refer to those later. The revenue from imports and excise duties per head of the population in New South Wales for the year 1899-1900 was ?1 5s. 7d., and the Premier, in his speech, subject to correction, said it was ?1 5s., or more. The Premier says the Tariff would raise something like ?6,000,000. This would reduce the taxation now levied on the people as follows : - In Victoria, there would be a reduction of 13s. 5d.; in Queensland, ?2 ; in South Australia, 9s. Id.; in Western Australia, . ?3 3s. 7d.; and in Tasmania, ?1 4s. 3d. If tie Northern Territory be taken over by the Federal Government, South Australia will be relieved of a considerable loss which she now incurs by reason of having control of that part of the continent, and approximately the wage-earners, by such a reduction, would be relieved within the five States mentioned of something like ?2,000,000 of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- I was quite prepared for that interjection, and -I am glad it has been made. The.financial exigencies of the States may be adjusted by direct taxation within those States. There may be an increase in the probate and stamp duty, in the land and income taxes, and in the dividend tax, in four at least of the States ; and, for reasons that are patent, if Queensland and Western Australia adopted a land tax it would be a very excellent experience for those States and greatly to the advantage of Australia. I am dealing with this 'part of the question because I find free-traders are inclined to take it for granted that there may be a Tariff of ?8,000,000 or ?8,500,000, whereas by forcing on the States the necessity for economy within their borders, and raising revenue by taxation from those "springs of revenue," which the Premier desired should not be dried, we might from those sources realize sufficient to make ends meet. An honorable member for Tasmania interjected, "What about Tasmania?" But if Tasmania is in such straits that she must be assisted, it would be better for that State to receive a subsidy than that her condition should be a drag on the whole of the Commonwealth. It would be better that " Tassy," as one honorable member put it, should receive, as I believe she would be willing to receive, a subsidy, if it were the opinion of Parliament that there should be introduced a policy that would not bear heavily on the whole of the Commonwealth. * The adoption of such a policy would be both practicable and just, and the masses of the people would be benefited by federation in a way which would strongly appeal to them, seeing that they have been told that federation is to be a great blessing. If the people of this great continent can be shown that it is practicable to bring in a free-trade Tariff - a Tariff that will reduce taxation per head of the population, and not only in ah. indirect way through the Custom House removing the possibility of those persons who receive what is called "protection," increasing the cost of living by something like 33 pei- cent., as is the case in America, then </para>

                            <para>- The member for Wentworth says - "When the time comes," but I fail to see that the time is not now, because we might enable Tasmania or Western Australia, or any other needy State, to make ends meet, if it is in the interests of Australia that we should have a free-trade Tariff. The honorable member who preceded me stated that all the raw material of this continent should be manufactured here, and that through the goods being manufactured here all the money would be kept in the country and all the labour in the country would be employed, so that everybody would prosper. Now if that policy is to be carried to its logical conclusion, I think we should have a policy of prohibition. If we introduced even a prohibitive Tariff we could carry on the affairs of Government just as we might carry them on under a free-trade Tariff which raised ?6,000,000 of money. Protectionists believe that a prohibitive Tariff would protect the artisan, and provide work for every craft. But if they believe a little protection to be good, would not a great amount of it be better? </para>

                            <para>- We should have the tallow used up in the making of soap. These are arguments which have been used by the Attorney-General himself, but I find that of late years he is inclined to think that those industries that have been fostered for the last 35 years ought by this time to be able to stand alone, and so do I. Where are the protectionists, that they allow the Government to continue in office, when instead of giving them protection, they have to come over to the opposition side and have practically adopted a free-trade policy? I find that the Government say that a rigid adherence to fiscal theories would cause the destruction of sources of employment. Does that mean that protection as a policy has broken down in Victoria? The loss of population that has taken place in Victoria and the losses that have occurred in other ways to her manufactories, are arguments that I will not bring forward, because honorable members have had a great deal of them. Do the arguments put forward by some honorable members mean that a free-trade Tariff such as is operating in New South Wales would lead to the unnecessary destruction of sources of employment? This is the argument used by the Ministry in this part of the speech of the Governor-General. The honorable member who preceded me challenged this side to show that there was ever any progress made in free-trade countries. Since 1896, when free-trade was introduced in New South Wales the hands employed in factories have increased by something like 11,000, the number to-day being only 5,000 fewer than the number employed in the factories of Victoria. But I am not desirous of contrasting one State with another, because there has been so much of it already, and probably honorable members have had enough of that part of the subject. A great deal could be said, however, from other points of view in favour of New South Wales as a State, which has been able to carry on, and maintain her manufactures under a freetrade Tariff, and that to a greater extent and in a better way, than smaller industries have been carried on in the State of Victoria. We find that in Victoria they are dismissing men and taking on women and little children. In New South Wales they are dismissing women and taking on men, and the little children find their way to the play-ground. </para>

                            <para>- They receive ?6 a year, food, clothing, and medical attendance. Their passages are paid to Queensland. All this represents a considerable sum. Further, the money for their return passage is lodged with the Government on their arrival in Queensland. So that I maintain that the actual money paid for each kanaka in wages and in other ways is not less than would be paid to a white man ; but the point is that it is reliable labour, and if reliable white labour were obtainable, I am quite sure none would rejoice more than would the sugar planters themselves. </para>

                            <para>- They are diminishing in Queensland, at any rate. Whether they die out or not I cannot say. It is said that the kanakas compete with the white men ; but they do not. In Queensland the kanakas are used entirely for field work. They are not even allowed to drive a horse and cart. They are doing work that hitherto white men have not taken to. White men have attempted the work, but they say that it is only fit for slaves. If white men can do this kind of work it is strange that they, instead of the kanakas, are not doing it. The kanakas do not remain in Queensland. They do not intermarry. They never become tradesmen. I venture to say that no honorable member in this House has ever known a kanaka to become a storekeeper or a tradesman. Surety, then, a few thousand kanakas will not prevent this country from remaining a white Australia. In a few years time the kanaka question will settle itself, for they are gradually going away from Queensland. Ten years ago there was a larger number there than there are to-day. There are about 8,000 at the present time. </para>

We look forward to having no kanakas at all .

                            <para>- I understand that. I am old enough to remember when, much further down the coast than Townsville, malaria carried white people off much as it is carrying them off now further north. I remember when fever and ague were very prevalent about Brisbane itself, and fever and ague I take to be a form of malaria. I remember when the railway was being constructed towards Roma, and when the navvies who were engaged in turning up the scrub died, as was said at the time, "like rotten sheep." This malaria, as it appears to me, is a result of opening up soil in virgin country, and is not so much a matter of climate. But, while we say the white man cannot stand this work in these latitudes, let us ask ourselves whether the kanaka stands it - if we look at this matter from a humanitarian point of view, let us ask ourselves that question. These kanakas are recruited from the islands, and are supposed to be brought to Queensland hale, strong men, with a certificate of health ; but the fact is that their death rate is something like 47 per thousand, as against twelve per thousand of the' white population, including nien, women, and children, who are occupying northern parts of the State, and doing well. On the authority of an honorable member who preceded me, and who represents a constituency in Queensland, we know that large holdings on sugar plantations have been cut up, and that white families are carrying on tropical agriculture in some of these places and if white families can do that, why cannot sugar be grown under similar conditions and circumstances in the same locality? Does the fact that white families are profitably working agriculture make the white man or his family immune from the complaints or diseases which arise through working in tropical countries ? If a white family can do this work, cannot other white men do it if it be made worth their while ? </para>

                            <para>- Pay him; that is the thing. When seeking election I went a little further than the Government do in the speech of His Excellency the Governor General, and urged that the recruiting of kanakas should be stopped immediately. I would allow those islanders who are here to remain if they wish, and compel planters who have entered into agreements with them to send them back to the islands if they desire to go. By that means there would be a gradual, though not too slow diminution of kanakas ; and if kanakas were required to clear tropical scrub on the northern rivers and make the land fit for the planting of sugar, there would be sufficient of them in the State to engage in the work, while the white man took up the other part of the work of the sugar-growing. It was said that the kanakas are confined to certain classes of work in the plantations, and the member for Melbourne Ports interjected that he had seen five drays driven by kanakas. But I have seen two drays driven by one kanaka, and I have seen kanakas engaged in all kinds of work ; they are not confined to trashing and cutting cane, but when the inspector's back is turned they engage in all kinds of occupations. </para>

                            <para>- There may be an Act, but it is impossible to keep a policeman watching every kanaka. I know kanakas, not only engaged in agriculture, but others who have been here for 30 years, having been brought over to grow cotton, and who are still here engaged in driving coaches and carriages, and doing gardening and all kinds of work. But there is an aspect of the question that has been lost sight of, namely, the influence of the presence of these aliens on the morals and health of the community. I would ask honorable members who have not been in the northern parts- of Queensland, to make themselves acquainted with the conditions of life there. Let them make inquiries of those who have been there as to the contamination of the race of this young nation. To me it is a far more serious thing to have the blood of this young nation contaminated, as we know it is being contaminated by this alien race, than it would be to lose the sugar industry. I have no desire to see the sugar industry perish, but I would rather see that come about than see the race we hope will live and build up a nation, perish and become unworthy of its ancestors. Yet that is what is going on. In some of the northern towns may be seen a polyglot population, a mixture of almost all the races of the earth. And what is the fact with regard to the health of the community ? A few years ago none of us knew what a leper was, except by reading of him in the old Book, in which it is said the people cried "Unclean, unclean," and got out of his way. Now we have lazaredes established in every State. </para>

                        <para>- For Europeans, too, unfortunately. We have two lazarettes in Queensland, one on Stradbrooke Island for whites, and one on Friday Island for kanakas. I want to know how lepers came to this country. Did Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotchmen, Danes, or Germans bring the disease here ? No ; it came from the islands of Polynesia, and from China and other parts of Asia, and this is one of the prices we are paying for the sugar industry. Honorable members may talk about the large amount of money invested in that industry, but Queensland has a bigger stake than the ?7,000,000said to be thus invested. I have been at the homes of some of the lepers, and would ask honorable members to think of the misery that is entailed. I have seen homes from which the leper has been taken, and we know that at public schools in Queensland, children of lepers thus removed have been refused admission. It would have been ten thousand times better for the children had their father been carried out of his home dead. There would have then been no refusal to admit the orphans- to the school, and no social ostracism ; but because the man had been taken to the lazarette, other parents declined to allow their children to mix with the children of the leper lest there should be contagion. And those parents cannot be blamed, although the doctors tell us the disease is not contagious. If the disease is not contagious, how is it we find Eather Damien, after fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen years at Molokai, dying of leprosy ; and how is it we find nearly all of those who come in contact with lepers, contracting and dying, of the disease. No doctor can persuade me the disease is not contagious. I have seen the lepers in tie lazarette,. and if honorable members saw some of the scenes there, they would come to the conclusion that there is a bigger consideration in settling the question of alien labour, than the ?7,000,000 said to be invested in the sugar industry. I am speaking, warmly because I believe this is tie biggest question before the Federal Parliament. Bigger than the Tariff question, bigger than, defence questions, bigger than the administration of any of the departments we have taken over, is this one question of keeping our race a pure and a white race, worthy of the people from whom we sprung. Australia has held her own in the universities of the world ; she has held her own on the sports ground ; she has held her own on the battle field ; and are we going to suffer these inferior races from Asia and Polynesia to come in and cause a degeneration in the race ? I hope we shall not, no matter how much capital may be said to be invested in the sugar industry. Let us preserve that capital; I believe it can be preserved. It was said by one of tie speakers in this- debate, and by the Honorable Angus Gibson,, in the State Parliament of Queensland, that, if a duty of ?5 per ton were levied on all sugar introduced from other countries, we would be giving enough protection to the sugar-growers in Queensland, and the planters- could then afford to grow sugar and pay wages to white men. </para>

                            <para>- It will help us to keep our own local markets at any rate, and we will increase those markets by protection. I am in entire accord with the speakers on both sides of the House in regard to the matter of defence, I believe that we should begin with cadets, and train up a citizen soldiery. Our boys in South Africa have proved that very little training is really necessary to turn out efficient soldiers. With regard to the federal capita], I hope that the selection of the site will not be delayed long, and that every honorable member will have an opportunity of inspecting the various sites that have been suggested. I trust that this matter will not be relegated to a select committee, but that an opportunity of visiting the sites will be afforded to every member who wishes to do so. However much honorable members might like to remain in Melbourne, those who come from the northern, and may I say the greatest of the States, would like to get a little nearer to the equator. </para>

                        <para>. - If I do so, I must confess it is with some regret, for I have had a list of really formidable proportions handed to me, containing the names of honorable members who desire to address the House. I take it that it is impossible to apply to honorable members in this our first debate the usual pressure, but, at the same time, as we have made progress more rapidly this evening, may I appeal to honorable members to assist us to-morrow in expediting the number of speeches, so that we may be able to dispose of the Address in Reply at the first day of meeting next week. </para>
