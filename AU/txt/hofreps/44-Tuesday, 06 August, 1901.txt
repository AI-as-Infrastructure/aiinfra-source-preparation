                        <para>- It is my painful duty to inform the House that intelligence has been received of the death of the Dowager Empress of Germany, Princess Royal of England, sister of His Majesty the King. </para>

                        <para>. - I take it, sir, that the news which you have announced leaves only one course open to us. Loath as I am to make any suspension in public business, recognising as I do the importance and the urgency of the measures which are before the House for its consideration, I cannot, nor can any of us, forget that the death announced to us is the death of the sister of the King of the Empire. The Princess Royal was a woman who endeared herself to every man of British blood by her thoroughly English character. She was a worthy daughter of a noble mother. She was the aunt of the Duke of Cornwall and York, who with his consort has just visited these shores, and who, there is reason to believe, will soon be Prince of Wales, and who is the heir to the throne. If there is a personal reason for us to be added to the urgency disclosed by these facts it is that as an Englishwoman the Princess Royal, who became the Empress of Germany, and was at her death the Dowager Empress, and the mother of the Emperor of Germany, was throughout her life able to reconcile her intense loyalty to the Britain in which she was born with her duties to the great </para>

                        <para>- It is only since I arrived here this afternoon that I heard of the very sad event which you, sir, have announced to the House. In a matter of this kind we must be guided by the leader of the House. Great as may be the disturbance to public business at a time like this, I concur with him that it is an occasion on which, by adjourning, we can show our respect for and condolence with the King of this Empire. Also,thissad event concerns a kindred nation to which we are very closely allied; and certainly the life of the remarkable woman which has just been closed was one which we can class with that of her beloved mother, whose loss we so lately deplored. </para>
