                        has been in communication with the Government of. Queensland and also with the* Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, on the question of the future of British New Guinea. If Imperial Government desire that administrator should take directions from Commonwealth instead of Queensland, three States above-named appear likely to support that step. If you approve of the change, Ministers are prepared to bring before Parliament for proper authority. It would be necessary for the Commonwealth to guarantee about £22;000 per annum for the next five years. In view of difficulties imposed on early finances of the Commonwealth for the next five years, and perhaps, ten years, by sections 87, 89, and 03 of the Constitution, my Ministers suggest that during five years Imperial Government should find £7,000 per annum of proposed amount, being the sum formerly contributed by Imperial Government under lapsed agreement and covering maintenance of steamer

                        <para>- The reason we asked that was that the Imperial Government used to find the amount, but had ceased to do so. Honorable members will readily recognise that if the Federal Government is to observe due economy it will be necessary for it to strive against any excess over that amount, which, under the original agreement, was to be found by the three contributing States, namely, £15,000 a year. I think the other £7,000 a year is only a fair contribution, and involves none of the dangers of such contributions in other oases, because the request that will be made, if the House agrees with me, is that the administration of New Guinea shall carry with it a control which ought not to be in the hands of the Imperial Government but in the hands of the Commonwealth. </para>

I presume that the right honorable gentleman has considered this matter and will be able to inform the House whether the cost could not be so debited ? </para>

                    <para>- It will be within the recollection of honorable members that when I addressed myself to this BilL on the occasion of the second reading, I limited my observations to its principles, presuming, of course, that upon any moot points there would be ample opportunity for debate in committee. I think we have now arrived at a stage when one of these points of the Bill, which has been specially marked out not only by honorable members in their previous observations, but by the petitions which we have received from all over the Commonwealth, arises. The attention bestowed upon this matter evidences the importance which is attached to the particular clause which now comes up for consideration. I hope that I shall be able to limit my remarks upon clauses 55 and 56 - for they really ought to be read together - to a very reasonable length. Still, I trust that honorable members will give me credit for a desire to fathom the depths of these clauses - if there be any fathoming necessary- 'and will .acknowledge that, if I am brief, it is not because I have anything to conceal. I wish that there shall be the utmost fairness in the debate in connexion with these clauses. I have most especial reasons for wishing this. I am associated with these clauses in two forms, and, before I have closed my observations, I may desire to refer to these forms. </para>

                        <para>- I want now, in perfect fairness, to explain, if I know, what is the purpose of these clauses, so that honorable members shall not take a leap in the dark. I express to them the belief that, if they vote for these clauses, their provisions will be utilized sooner or later - unless they are upset by the High Court of Judicature as being in contravention of State rights - for the suppression of " Tattersail's " sweeps. I want it to be distinctly understood. 1 am not going to say positively that it will be so, but we are empowering the Postmaster-General to exercise arbitrarily, at his own sweet will, the intention that he has - and whether the present Postmaster-General has, or has not, such an intention, a later Postmaster-General may have - to put in motion the machinery which will absolutely suppress " Tattersalls." It will stand in the way of the tens of thousands of people who have been in the habit of sending their pounds or their shillings to this particular individual. </para>

                        <para>- I shall come to that point presently. I have some little suspicion when an honorable member on the other side, notwithstanding that he is an estimable friend, puts a question of that kind to me, that he does it for the purpose of damaging my case or my party, but it will not in any way affect the reply which I shall give. I hope honorable members of this Parliament will, if they do not know me now, know me, as time rolls on, as a man who- has nothing to conceal ; as a man who tries to discharge to the best of his ability the duty before him, even though that duty may be an unpleasant one. We have had these various provisions, not in operation, but in suspense. The various States, because they were separate States, have viewed with leniency the passage of these letters, which otherwise would have been stopped from one State to the other. Four separate States have had full power to refuse delivery within their own boundaries, yet they failed to exercise that power when it came to stopping letters of this kind posted to an address within a neighbouring and friendly State. They may have been influenced by the international conventions at Budapest or Berne, or wherever the conventions may have been held ; they may have been influenced by these international arrangements, and especially by the articles of the last Berne postal convention, which practically enacted that letters posted in one kingdom should pass to another. Now we have come to a different state of things. We are no longer six separate States dealing in six separate methods with postal matters. We are a Commonwealth, and, therefore, letters posted within the Commonwealth for delivery within the Commonwealth are certainly within the ken of our own Acts of Parliament, I am not sure whether we are not going outside our powers in saying under the clause that we will not transmit. That will be a matter for the lawyers bo decide. I am disposed to think, however, that letters posted within the Commonwealth to an address outside the Commonwealth must, under the International Convention Postal Laws be transmitted to those' places. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member may think so, bub I do not. It may be considered advisable to make provision that while we retain the power to withhold the delivery of letters addressed to places within the Commonwealth, and their transmission from State to State, we shall not take the power to withhold the transmission of letters to addresses outside the Common: wealth. That will be a' matter for the committee to decide. The power of course may be taken, and I sincerely hope that at the next postal convention, which I think will be held in Rome next year, special attention will be given to the purpose of these clauses. It will be the duty of whoever represents the Commonwealth there to call attention to our purpose to stop such correspondence. I hope that when the Postal Union meets in Rome next year the Commonwealth will be ably represented, and that especial attention will be given to the question whether Postmasters-General should not be permitted to exercise the power of refusing to transmit beyond the borders of their own country letters such as those which are dealt with in the clause. I hold that at the present time the Postmaster-General has not the power to do that. </para>

                        <para>- I do. I have not read the American Act, but I believe that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo has given attention to this matter, and I hope that we shall presently hear from him how that country gets over the difficulty. It is certain, however, that the countries which enter the Postal Union are bound by the regulations and articles agreed upon in conference, and therefore it seems to me that we shall be compelled to try to secure at an early date such an alteration of the conditions as will enable us to interfere in regard to the transmission of letters addressed to places beyond our own borders. The honorable member for Kooyong has called attention to the large number of petitions which have been presented to both Houses of the Legislature, both for and against this and the following clause. I believe that over 120,000 people in New South Wales signed a petition against these clauses, and I think that over 110,000 people in Victoria did the same. Similar petitions came from other places within the Commonwealth. But, on the other hand, a great number of petitions have been presented in favour of the clauses, and, though the signatures to those petitions may be fewer than the signatures to the petitions against the clauses, the petitions have come from persons whose influence is felt throughout the community. Much as we may respect those who from conscientious grounds object to the retention of the clauses, we must also respect the opinions of those who desire to protect the purity of our young people from the temptations to gambling with which they are assailed. The Government, however, have decided to go beyond the evidence of public opinion afforded by these petitions, and to accept the views which are embodied in the legislation which has been passed by the people's representatives in a majority of the States. We find that in four of the States there is an absolute prohibition, and in one of the States a limited prohibition, of the practice which' the clauses are intended to prevent, and Ministers have therefore felt it incumbent upon them to bring the legislation of the Commonwealth into line with that of the majority of the States, and to try to prevent the transmission through the Post-office of moneys devoted to the furtherance of sweeps. If we did not do that, we should have to say that the States have not acted wisely, but have acted hysterically, and without recognising the signs of the times. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think he had any hesitation on the subject. I would now refer honorable members to section 99 of the Constitution Act. I refer to that provision with bated breath, because I am far from able to interpret its meaning, but I think that we can read in it the intention that our legislation should not make any distinction between Tasmania and the remaining States of the Commonwealth, even in a matter of this kind. The provision to which I refer says that Parliament must give no preference in matters relating to trade, commerce, or revenue to any one State or part thereof. It seems to me that if we passed legislation which would enable letters containing money orders which could not be transmitted to other States to be transmitted to Tasmania, and thus gave that State, a preference in regard to her revenue, the intention of the Constitution would be thwarted. I have lived in Tasmania for 41 years, and I believe that no equal can be found to that country for climate or the companionships that one may make there, or anything else. The people there have shown their, confidence in me by allowing me to remain in public life for 35 years without defeat. All those things are sufficient to make a man who loves his adopted home strive all he can to maintain her fair prestige, and to return the good-will which has been shown towards him. Under these circumstances, honorable members will understand that I have not undertaken the duty of representing the Postmaster-General in regard to the conduct of this Bill through committee without great embarrassment. During my 35 years of political life - many of the past 28 years which have been spent as a Minister - circumstances have placed me in strange corners, and this is such an occasion. But, having stated to the committee the case of the Commonwealth in regard to this proposed legislation, I shall have great pleasure now in putting forward the case of Tasmania. In the year 1896, in association with the right honorable member for Tasmania, I passed through the Tasmanian Legislature an Act to regulate and suppress public gambling. We had found in Tasmania just the same evils as are in existence all through Australia now, but we have not now in Tasmania the exposed evils which are to be seen in every street in the cities in New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. This Act of 1896 suppressed gambling in our little tote' shops, it caused to be dragged down every public advertisement which would give offence to the most susceptible conscience. It prevented the newspapers from advertising lotteries all through the country districts, and it stopped public gambling to such an extent that if I were to take honorable members to El wick race-course tomorrow they would think they were on the lawn in some gentleman's park, and could enjoy themselves without the noise and turmoil that has to be submitted to at Randwick or Caulfield or Flemington. I contend that a great deal of good has been done by the operation of the Bill I have mentioned, and I join those who have spoken on the subject before, in expressing the wish that it might be possible to find throughout Australia the refined conditions, and culture in association with racing that, are exhibited in Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- The fault of nature. Nature has been prolific, but her wealth has only lately been discovered. It has only been within the last eight years that we have realized the latent wealth. that has been stored in Tasmania for ages ; but the metalliferous exports of that State now amount to £1,700,000 a year. Partly owing to this and partly through the excessive taxation by means of customs duties they have been realizing a surplus during the last eight years, ranging from £100,000 to £130,000 per annum. I find, however, that the Treasurer, in anticipation of the falling-off which may occur under a uniform Tariff, thinks that for the year 1902 he will not only lose his surplus of £130,000 but that there may be a deficiency of that sum in the Customs and Excise revenue. That, however, is one of the responsibilities which Tasmania has taken, upon herself in joining the Commonwealth, and our responsibility now consists in taking away from Tasmania another portion of her revenue. Since the year 1892 the Postal and Telegraph department in that State has been paying its way and the revenue has been showing a gradually increasing surplus of from £2,000 up to £15,000, partly of course as the result of the " Tattersall " sweep business. Under the clauses in this Bill there is very little doubt that Tasmania will be a large loser of revenue,- and I think it my duty to call the attention of honorable members to the effect of their action in this. matter - to the very great financial responsibility which they incur in voting for this measure. Before I close my remarks, which have extended to greater length than I had intended, I would like to explain my own personal position. I suppose we all like to be regarded as consistent, but if we are true to ourselves we are satisfied, and it does not matter what any one says. I am not going to attach any very great amount of importance to what any one may think of me so long as I am satisfied with myself, but I have heard observations which I have regretted - observations which have not been couched in the language of courtesy, but which have been, in fact, offensive. T. desire to say in personal justification that when I join a Government, I join it not for the purpose of finding out wherein we can differ, but wherein we can agree. When I join a Government, I do it with regard to some great principle upon which I believe I may be at one with my colleagues, and not for the purpose of finding out some minor matters with regard to which I may create discord. Therefore, although I might personally like to speak for Tasmania and .to vote for Tasmania, I am true to my colours and loyal to my colleagues. And I hope that I shall be so in, the future, as I claim ever to have been in the past, even though I may have to make; some sacrifices. I am therefore supporting; the Bill in its entirety. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Tasmania Act for the better regulation and suppression of gambling, passed in 1896,. certain regulations were issued to the effect, that no man who was not duly licensed, and  who had not made a deposit of £10,000,, should be entitled to receive through the Post-office letters relating to lotteries. The: arrangement was that all the moneys in the) shape of contributions should go to the conductors of the sweeps and lotteries by letters sent through the post. Then regulations were gazetted in March, 1897, which, empowered the Postmaster-General to stop letters which were addressed to persons, who were not duly licensed under the Act, and under this authority I stopped the letters of a man who was not licensed, and returned them to the writers with an endorsement, "Illegal or unlicensed lottery." These were regulations framed by the Cabinet of which the right, honorable gentleman was the Premier and I was Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- I have never done any business in tote shops, but I am aware that in some instances at any rate - as is the case with bookmakers - gambling is done upon credit. The individual who unsuccessfully gambles in this way may be lured on to recover himself until he has lost so much that it becomes a question of the payment of a debt of honour by an act of dishonour - by filching  the money with which to liquidate his liability. In order that gambling might be as far as possible extirpated from Tasmania, this Bill for its suppression was introduced. It is not a Bill that was introduced for the special object of licensing " Tattersalls " or any other sweep. It was submitted with a general object, and with an honest intention to do away with the more pernicious, attractive, and dangerous forms of gambling which were known to exist in the community. We knew that its operation would result in a certain increase of postal business, but does that affect the morality or otherwise of " Tattersalls " ? Does that alter the position in the slightest degree, unless it be in favour of the view which I take that " Tattersall," besides doing good to its own promoters, does good to the whole Government - to the Postal services throughout the States of the Commonwealth - by contributing largely to their revenue ? I do not see that that of itself is a valid argument against " Tattersalls " or any other institution whatever.- It has been said that " Tattersalls " is a monopoly. That is one of the many absurd misrepresentations which have been broadcasted  throughout the community. But there is no monopoly. If honorable members will consult the Tasmanian Act, which legalizes the operation of certain sweeps under stringent conditions, they will find that there is no mention of any particular person, and that anybody, by fulfilling all the conditions required - which include the lodging of a deposit of £10,000, which is liable to forfeiture for a breach of the regulations - can obtain from the Government, of the day a licence to carry on his sweep just as well as can George Adams. </para>

                        <para>- I dare say that if people in possession of that amount thought that they could carry out those conditions, without rendering themselves liable to the forfeiture of the £10,000, there would be a good many come along. Another gross misrepresentation of the character of " Tattersall's " is that people would be attracted to the offices in which " Tattersall " transacted his business, and that as a result an amount of betting would be conducted which would tend to the demoralization of the people. Nothing was ever more preposterous in this world. "Tattersall's," as conducted in Tasmania, has nothing whatever to do with the backing of horses. It is used exclusively for the sale of tickets upon sweeps. In order to prevent the place in which " Tattersall's " business is carried on from becoming crowded by those of the gambling fraternity, who might lure each other on to indulge in dangerous speculation, the Act itself - not the regulations - provides that no tickets shall be sold by " Tattersall " except through the medium of the Post-office. </para>

I know that " Tattersall " never did engage in the business of backing horses. In the Act to which I have been referring, it is prescribed as a safeguard to the public morality that no tickets shall be sold by "Tattersall " except through the medium of the post. The regulations enforced are also of a most stringent character. These require that the lotteries shall be conducted under the supervision of an officer appointed from the Treasury, that the accounts shall be supervised by the Auditor-General, and that the people conducting the sweeps - that is to say, " Tattersall's " agents - shall have nothing whatever to do with handling the marbles or with dealing with the boxes from which those marbles are taken. As a, member of this Chamber, I have a right to show to what extent I was guided by an intention and belief which, this House may deem to be honorable, upright, and just. The Minister in charge of this Bill, who, doubtless, to some extent feels himself in a false position, was entirely with me in the introduction of that measure, which I think he has called a model of legislation. </para>

                        <para>- It is wider because of the non-inclusion in the Constitution of Australia of certain sections which to some extent tend, although in a minor degree, to limit the power of Congress over some subjects. This question has been fought out and has been practically decided under the federal constitution in the United States. I should like to remind the right honorable member for Tasmania who has just spoken, that many years ago the Federal Congress of the United States, in the Reserve Statute No. 3894, passed a law to this effect - </para>

                        <para>- I think, as a matter of fact, that these sweeps and consultations which were rampant in the city were driven out of Melbourne to a large extent, and then found a resting place in other States where there was no law against them. The law that was passed in 1883 in Victoria was re-enacted in 1890, and so satisfactory was the operation of this legislation found that at the conference of Deputy Postmasters-General held in 1891, at which the whole of the Australian States were represented, it was agreed that it was desirable that legislation for the suppression of lotteries should be made uniform throughout the whole of the States. I present that as a very striking testimony in support of the proposed legislation. A few months after this conference, Queensland engrafted on to her statutes the Victorian clause for the suppression of sweeps and consultations, but unfortunately only granted a permissive power to the Postmaster-General, which was not exercised for some time. In 1893 New South Wales passed a similar law, and in the same year Western Australia passed an Act of like effect. So that then we had four out of the six colonies brought into line with an almost uniform law - uniform with the exception of the words "prohibit transmission," which it was found necessary afterwards to insert in ,the Victorian law in order to enable the Postmaster-General to prevent the transmission as well as the delivery of lottery matter. The New South Wales Act is similar except that there is no power to prevent transmission, but substantially the four States were brought into line. Although no similar clause was enacted in South Australia, there is nevertheless a very strong anti-lottery and anti-gambling law in that State, which has been enforced since 1875. </para>

Society built on such a foundation would almost of necessity bring forth a population of speculators and gamblers, living on the expectation of what, by the casting of lots or by lot, chance or otherwise, might be awarded to them from the accumulation of others. Certainly the right to suppress them is governmental, to be exercised at all times by those in power, at their discretion. </para>

                    <para>Many of the States, by statutory provision, prohibit lottery advertisements and prohibit lottery agencies or the sale of lottery tickets, and subject the offender to fines from $50 to $2,000. Many, very many, of the best newspapers in the land refuse to become parties to this scheme of obtaining money by false pretences, and refuse to advertise lotteries, and advocate the justness of the people's cause in excluding from the mails papers that do advertise lotteries or lottery drawings. I regret to Say that the district of Columbia, the scat of the Government of this nation, has failed to provide necessary legislation to prohibit the carrying on and advertising this worst of all classes of gambling, and in consequence this city contributes, as I am advised, about $1,500,000 annually. The immense wealth accumulated by this Louisiana State lottery has enabled it to control almost everything in Louisiana. Finance, politics, morals, seem to be controlled by this power, and to oppose it, particularly in New Orleans, seems to be fatal. If we should be disposed to believe editorials appearing in the leading New Orleans papers lately, we would be convinced that lottery money was used very largely to elect governors 'and legislatures with a view to control legislation. I am advised too that not long since, almost within the shadow of the dome of the capital of this nation, a well-known gentleman of this city gave a dinner to a number of distinguished gentlemen, and when the wine flowed freely one of the speakers of the occasion took the opportunity to put all parties upon notice that if there was any legislation permitted at this session of Congress antagonistic to the interests of the Louisiana State Lottery the company would see during the next campaign that any member favouring such legislation should be relegated to the shades of private life. If this be true it is quite apparent that the Louisiana State Lottery is not only in the business oi making statesmen, but when necessary is disposed to engage in unmaking them. The good people of the State of Louisiana are making an honest, honorable, heroic effort to purge the State of this plague that has for the past twenty years been a blot upon the good name and fame of her people. Let us stand up and be counted as friends of the United States ; wo cannot afford to longer remain a silent partner. </para>

                    <para>- I think that almost every honorable member agrees with, what has fallen from the lips of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo with regard to lotteries. We recognise that it is a great misfortune, indeed, that gambling should exist in any State. I am quite sure, that the great bulk of honorable members do not wish to encourage that evil in any way whatever. The only point of difference which there may be between us, as far as I can judge from the general tone of the debate, is as to whether such a proposal as is now under consideration ought to be introduced into a Bill of this kind. Even if we think it ought, there is a question as to whether our power to legislate upon it does not conflict with the law at least of one of the States. If we study the Consti'tution Act, we shall find that however right, it may be that the various States shall give us power to regulate the moral affairs of the community, no. such power has really been given to us. That being so, the question arises - " Ought we in this Bill to seize upon an opportunity to regulate as far as we can the character of the matter transmitted through the post" ? If we can accomplish that object without interfering with the privacy of the Post-office, I am sure that all of us will be only too glad to do so. We should be glad indeed to exterminate all baneful influences to the community. It is with great diffidence that I speak upon this question, because I cannot help recognising the difficulty -with which we are confronted. Personally I have never attended horse racing, nor have I invested in " Tattersall's " sweep. I have no sympathy with either. But the point is that the various States have not given us power to legislate for the suppression of gambling. Ought we, therefore, on a particular Bill, to prevent them from carrying on transactions even though we believe those transactions to be wrong. </para>

                        <para>- That is the point which occurs to me. "We are trying to arrogate to ourselves a power which the States have not granted to us. Under these circumstances 1 feel that I cannot give my support to clauses which seem to interfere with the privacy of the Post-office. If these matters came before us in connexion with a gambling Bill I should be very willing to vote for provisions such as are here proposed. It is because we are too prone to insert in one Bill, matter which really belongs to another, that so much work is created for the lawyers. If the laws of the various States are not strict enough to deal with the gambling evil it is very easy for them to be amended. I merely rose to say that I do not think this Bill is the proper place to deal with this matter, and therefore I cannot support the clauses. </para>

                    WILLIS (Robertson).The address delivered by the Minister in charge of the Bill should have conveyed to us some of the benefits that would accrue from the retention of this clause in the Bill. He admitted that such a provision does not operate in any of the several States of the union save that of Queensland. We know from the petitions that have been presented from time to time that Queensland is very pronounced against the insertion of this clause, having discovered what was admitted by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, that the suppression of the totalizator does not necessarily lead to the suppression of gambling. Indeed the Minister in charge of the Bill said that in five out of ' the six States in the Commonwealth, gambling prevailed to a large extent, but that in the State of Tasmania it does not attain to such great proportions. We all know that " Tattersall " could not thrive in tasmania if it were not for the amount of money which is transmitted to him from Victoria and elsewhere. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo pointed out that Victoria had pushed "Tattersall" from this State into another. We find that that process has continued ever since. But each succeeding step of this kind has only added to the business transacted by "Tattersall " so that in Tasmania to-day it is greater than it ever was before. It seems to me that we have no right whatever to enact legislation of the character proposed in these clauses. The Minister in charge of the Bill said that in several States stringent laws against gambling have been enacted, and it would appear from his argument that those States have failed to administer their laws, and now propose in a circuitous way to make them operative by using the Post-office for the purpose. To my mind that is a purpose for which the Post-office was not established. The Postal department lias a monopoly of the delivery of letters. It has the exclusive right to transmit letters from one person to another. I think it was a fatal admission which the Minister made, when he said that the word "transmit" cannot become operative. even if it should be enacted by this House. The Minister .has admitted that according to the postal union we have not the right to prevent the transmission of letters from here to Tasmania, or Apia, or Noumea.

                        <para>-lt is the opinion which is also held by the Postmaster-General. Within several of the States there are stringent laws for the suppression of gambling, but those laws are inoperative inasmuch as the people's susceptibilities appear to be satisfied by the enactment of the laws without insisting upon their application. Perhaps they gamble nearer home now through the medium of the tote shops and other gambling dens which are to be found in every corner of this great city, and winch according to a statement made during a debate in the State Legislature, are to be found in every corner of every great street in this city. Hie same remark is applicable to our other great cities. The public rail against this gambling, but surreptitiously evade the law. All that was said by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo goes for nothing. We should like to suppress gambling, but this Bill will not do it. That is the point at issue between those who believe in these clauses, "and those who believe that such legislation will be inoperative, and will result only in the evil being shifted from one State to another. The totalizator exists in South Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, and elsewhere. The people indulge "in this innocent form of investing money by which it is possible that they may gain a large reward. We find also that some of the people who sign petitions in favour of these very clauses themselves promote art unions, raffles, and other games of chance. Notwithstanding these petitions, we find also that the people are in favour of what they call innocent forms of gambling - the raffle, the art union, the totalizator, and the lottery. They are not opposed to a game of chance. They practice it in every department of life, and in every institution it is resorted to. By every post we receive intimations that an art union is to be held to raise funds for a hospital or something of the kind. From one end of Australia to the other the people are in favour of lotteries. What they are opposed to are the evils which follow the laying of large sums of money with the bookmaker or with the welsher. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo quoted an American authority, who described gambling as a great evil. To tell us that is only to repeat a platitude. We all know that it is a" great evil. I myself am as strongly opposed to gambling as any honorable member of this House. I have never once taken a ticket in " Tattersalls " sweeps ; never once have I registered a bet with a bookmaker ; seldom have I been to the race-course, and I have been in Melbourne on Cup day, and have yet stopped away from the race-course. I merely mention these matters in order to show that I am not here to advocate the claims of the bookmaker or the promotion of gambling. My desire is to prevent gambling if possible. This measure is not, however, a sincere one. It is proposed for the purpose of enabling the Postmaster-General to pry into the private correspondence of individuals. The privacy of a man's household and his correspondence will be invaded under this Bill, if he chances to be labelled as the promoter of a sweep. Even a letter from his child will not be sacred ; it may be torn open by the Deputy Postmaster-General and returned to the sender, although the honorable and learned member for Bendigo seemed to dispute the power of the Postmaster-General under this clause to open such a letter. I am of opinion that a man's correspondence should be delivered to him whether he calls himself " Tattersall " or any other name. 'It does not concern us whether Tasmania will lose £14,000 a year by the adoption of this provision, or whether other States will benefit to that extent by the excision of the clause. What we have to consider is whether the clause has any right in the Bill ; whether it is the duty of this Parliament to administer the laws of the several States, or whether we should not leave to the States the administration of their own social laws. If they allow any of those laws to become a dead letter, it is no part of the duty of the Commonwealth to enact a provision such as this, which will have the effect of enabling the Commonwealth to administer the laws which the States themselves are unable to, or do not administer. What we are called upon to do, according to the title of the Bill, is to enact a law relating to the Postal and Telegraph service of the country. To that extent I am prepared to vote for it, but not for the purpose of establishing a code of morals, and enforcing them upon the people in the way indicated by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo and the Minister in charge of the Bill. Even if we shut out "Tattersall" from Tasmania there will be the same amount of labour to perform in the administration of the Post-office as we have to-day. The only difference will be that we shall lose an amount of postage, estimated at £14,000 a year, which will go either to the French at Noumea or the Germans at Samoa. What good can come from the enactment of this clause? We have the authority of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo for saying that such a provision has not lessened gambling in Victoria. We have the statement of the Minister that it has not lessened gambling in any other State. The passing of this clause will not tend to lessen gambling, and we have no right to introduce it in a law of this character. The constitutional aspect of the question has been referred to. It seems to me that that matter might be left to Tasmania. That State will very soon see whether we have the power to pass this law or not. If we allow the delivery of all these letters, as we are asked to do by the people and by the States themselves, we shall discharge our duties faithfully and well. "We shall be exceeding our powers in passing this clause for the purpose of suppressing what is said to be a form of gambling, when the Minister himself has failed to show that it would have that effect. We are asked to enact a vexatious, inquisitorial, and meddlesome law, which will not raise the moral condition of the people; and while the honorable and learned member for Bendigo urged the committee to vote in favour of the retention of this clause, I just as strongly beg the committee not to pass it. If we do, we shall be .violating the privileges of the people. We have no right to interfere with the private relations of individuals. When we take a man's correspondence, and toss it into the waste-paper basket, we exceed our duty. 1 represent a very large part of this Commonwealth, and the people of my great constituency have to a large extent expressed their opinions against the insertion of this clause. No reason has been advanced for its inclusion in the Bill, and I shall therefore vote for its excision. </para>

                    <para>- I feel sure that no honorable member" of this committee would advocate gambling. We are all desirous of abolishing it, but we want to see its abolition accomplished in a reasonable way. The Minister in charge of the Bill, so far as I could gather from his speech, is in a rather peculiar position. We know that as a member of a Tasmanian Government he introduced the Tasmanian law known as the Suppression of Betting Act. In that Act provision is made for putting down betting in public places and within buildings, and among other things it is enacted that, under certain conditions and circumstances, lotteries may be conducted. A regulation was framed under that Act which legalized what is generally known as " Tattersall's " in Tasmania. The Minister who has given effect to a law of that character in his own State must indeed be in a rather awkward position when he finds himself called upon here to support a Bill for the wiping out of that very Act. I oppose this clause on two grounds. The first ground is that I consider that to pass it would be to override the State rights of Tasmania. It has been argued otherwise, very ably I know, but I do not intend to involve myself in a question of that kind, because .1 know there are legal authorities in the committee who could twist me round their fingers, so to speak, upon that particular point. But even if we have the right to legislate in the way proposed, we should consider whether it is expedient to exercise that light. When I was stumping the country in support of the Commonwealth Constitution Bill, it was pointed out to me again and again that certain clauses in it gave extraordinary powers to the Federal Parliament. Following the cue given by the leaders of the movement, I invariably replied that it was safe to presume that its administration would be placed in the hands of reasonable men. Instead of that being the case, it seems to me that we are going to verify the doleful predictions of the anti-Billites; that we are going, at the very outset of our federal career, to raise a hornet's nest about our ears. Tasmania is a small State. It was induced to enter the Federation in the belief that it would be better for it to be inside the union than outside j but we propose at the very outset to set at defiance what Tasmania conceives to be her State rights in. this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I have no proof of the fact beyond the bare word of a gentleman in whom I have every reliance. I have been told, too, that there is reason to believe that, in some cases, money was abstracted from the letters ; at any rate some of- the senders asserted that they had contained money. The bundles which I have here do not contain, all the letters which were opened, which number nearly 2,000. Some of the letters were sent to the dead-letter office, a thing which was never contemplated by the Act, and kept there for the usual time before being opened. Thirty-five letters sent by the Dairy Produce Company were opened, though the name of the firm was printed on the envelope. Twenty letters from Holdsworth, Macpherson, and Co. were opened. </para>

                        <para>- They were sent on to the address given. But the opening of ordinary business letters is a trifling thing compared with the opening of letters from the Bank of New South Wales, which referred to matters of a most confidential nature. When the postal officials had any doubt, they should have sent for the person to whom the letters were addressed, and opened them in his presence. But letter after letter coming from the bank was opened - a scandalous proceeding on the part of the Postmaster-General, who authorized the opening. </para>

                    <para>The Bishop of Hereford bus been bothering Lord Salisbury to suppress betting by legislation. The good bishop and his supporters propose that any person who gets up a sweep or offers odds, or any publisher of a newspaper: which prints betting information, shall be liable to be fined as much as £100, or suffer three months' imprisonment with hard labour. Lord Salisbury would not look at such a measure. He told the Utopian clerical reformers that - ' ' By any action you may take you will not stop newspapers giving information on a matter of public interest such as the state of the odds on various races. I cannot conceive the state of society in which that kind of censorship of the press would be tolerated." He added that the advocates of this reform were going *' against the feelings and desires of a vast mass of people ;" and Lord Salisbury is right. </para>

                    is a man who could not be dishonest if he tried, but, of course it does not follow that other sweep promoters would be the same. There are many other evils besides gambling which we might desire to put down. I do not think that the controlling of those evils is facilitated by these clauses.

                        <para>- I should not in the least object. It has been suggested that the State control of these matters would form a source of revenue for the payment of old-age pensions. It is a most extraordinary thing that many clergymen - gentlemen for whom I have the very highest respect - have signed a petition in favour of this clause, whilst in their own churches they tolerate bazaars for raising funds. I have gone to bazaars very frequently. I attend them with the knowledge that I am going to be fleeced for a certain amount. I spend as much as I intend, and come away quite happy. I do not object to that, lt is an easy way of raising money for charitable purposes. Although I have a very great respect for the opinions of gentlemen of the cloth, I was rather surprised to get a printed article with the name of the Rev. H. Worrall  attached, in which he is alleged to have said that "Tattersall" had a monopoly in Tasmania. Honorable members know perfectly well that the Tasmanian Act is not confined to "Tattersall." Any one who chooses to conform to the conditions prescribed may do so. It may be a monopoly, because the public have faith in Adams. But it is not a monopoly in the legal sense, or in the sense that any one else is prohibited from conducting a sweep there if he so wishes. The Rev. H. Worrall  is credited with saying - </para>

                        <para>- it would if there were any default in the conditions attaching to the conduct of the sweeps. I want to know how the stoppage of "Tattersall" is going to minimize the evils of gambling? Even if we were successful in stopping "Tattersall" from conducting his business in Noumea, New Zealand, or any other place, we could not stop gambling. We should merely divert it into worse channels - channels in which we should lose all control over it. In my opinion the most objectionable form of gambling is the small tote shops which are run in some of the States under the cloak of tobacconist establishments and into which children may go and invest their shillings. But in the case of "Tattersall's" sweeps, where the whole business is conducted through the medium of the Post-office, people are not likely to be carried away by some temporary excitement. I have put a shilling or two into "Tattersall's" myself. I have not been at a race-course for ten years, although I have been brought up amongst horses all my life, and enjoy a horse-race very much. It is ridiculous to think that we are going to make people good by Act of Parliament. I noticed to-day something in one of the newspapers about "bulling " and "bearing" on the Stock Exchange. I do not exactly understand the meaning of the term, but it seems to me that there is a screw loose somewhere. To talk about abolishing " Tattersall's " sweeps seems to suggest that we are barking up the wrong tree ! Although this Bill was introduced in, and has passed through the Senate, the Minister finds it desirable to submit an amendment to prevent the different racing clubs from being affected. He admits the expediency of recognising what we may call a British sport, namely, horse-racing. He recognises that if we were to insert a provision in this Bill to interfere with horseracing it would not be tolerated for a single moment by the community. I ask the Minister to accept a further amendment of which I have given notice, and which will have the effect of allowing the Postmaster-General to transmit letters through the Post-office to any State in which the matter referred to has been legalized. </para>

I cannot see that the amendment has the effect which honorable members seem to think. The people of Queensland, I am aware, have passed a Postal Act prohibiting letters from being addressed to "Tattersall." But do honorable members think that residents of Queensland who wish to put their money in " Tattersall's " sweeps have not been addressing their letters to " Tattersall " in Tasmania ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. Queensland passed . legislation which prohibited the carrying of letters to " Tattersall," as I understand it, when his business was being conducted in that State. The same thing happened in New South Wales. A certain address had to be given and these letters were not allowed to be delivered there. But has there been any Act passed which prevents a letter from being posted in Queensland or New South Wales and delivered to " Tattersall " in Tasmania ? </para>

                        <para>- This clause is to do away with " Tattersall's." I am in favour of those sweeps. They provide a very honest system of gambling, and it should be the last to be suppressed. I deplored the driving of Adams' sweeps out of New South Wales, and I am going to vote against this clause, which will probably drive " Tattersall " into New Caledonia or some other island. I have seen his sweeps working in Tasmania, and I know of no State in the Commonwealth where racing is carried on upon purer lines. I know of no race-courses where you get fairer and more liberal odds than those of Tasmania, where the totalizator is allowed. I should not like to say that the whole tone of racing there is above the level of the sport in New South Wales or Victoria, where we have race . clubs equal to any in the world, but at the same time there is a strong feeling in Tasmania that by means of the totalizator the people obtain the most liberal odds. Those odds, however, in no way compare in liberality with those which a man obtains by investing in " Tattersall's " sweeps. If there are 80 horses entered for the Melbourne Cup, " Tattersall " gives SO prizes in respect of them. There is not only a prize for the winner, but a prize for every starter and non-starter. Thus, if a man draws a horse at all, he gets a prize. </para>

                        <para>- How much poorer would the country be if we did away with bookmakers ? If we are going to do away with gambling at all we ought to do away with it altogether. I object entirely to the abolition of what I consider the soundest and most honorable and liberal system of betting. I object to any interference with a man's right of making a wager. I am opposed to the Post-office being used as a kind of detective system to prevent people from putting money into a sweep, .while we allow other forms of betting to continue. We allow the Victoria Racing Club and the Australian Jockey Club to make certain regulations. We have given them the right to license bookmakers, to charge them £25 a year for the privilege of wearing a bag at Randwick or betting in public rooms in Sydney and Melbourne registered for that purpose. I cannot understand some of the votes given by this committee. I was really very sorry last night,when, as the result of the action taken by the Opposition, a majority of the committee refused to prevent the passing through the post of papers containing seditious and blasphemous matter. I think it would be very much to the advantage of the community if they were not allowed to be distributed. Although honorable members are prepared to pass legislation which will have the effect of wiping out the best and most honorably conducted lotteries, they are willing to permit bookmakers to continue to follow their avocations, and to allow still more dangerous systems of gambling to exist. I am not going to give a vote which will interfere with the rights and privileges of the people. It is better to allow lotteries to be carried on fairly and above board than to have them carried on secretly. </para>

                        <para>- If the individual States exercised the power which they at present possess, "Tattersall's" would suffer very severely. I do not believe that if this measure is passed the provisions which we are discussing will be held in abeyance. I think that laws are framed for the purpose of being imposed. The point which I wish to enforce is that if the States put into operation the laws which they at present possess, the revenue which is obtained by "Tattersall's," and, through him, by the State of Tasmania, would be very much diminished, if not altogether put an end to. The committee, in agreeing to these clauses, will be re-enacting what is already the legislation of the States. </para>

I mention that fact a» evidence that efforts were made to get anyone to sigh these petitions. No doubt am analysis of the signatures to the petitions, in favour of the clauses might show that, some signatures are there which are equally irregular, but, in my opinion, the petition* which were signed by those who can have nothing but the public interest in view should be preferred to those which in some cases were signed because of the possibility' of personal gain resulting. I believe that these clauses will reduce the amount of gambling done by the community, though they will not entirely do away with gambling, and I think that they should also,bepassed because it is the duty of this Parliament to respect the legislation of the States- </para>

                <para>
                    (Northern Melbourne).It is not often that I speak merely to explain a vote, but I feel that I must in this* instance. The honorable gentleman who has led the opposition to this clause need have' no apprehension that his attitude in regard to it will be misunderstood. We all recognise that those who have spoken against the clause are as Much opposed to the vice of gambling as any others. I have no sympathy with a great many of the arguments. which have been used in favour of legislation of this sort, because I think they go too far, and would almost justify the resurrection of the spirit of persecution which the experience of centuries has shown to be so damaging to the growth and development of the race. We should be very careful to see that we do not interfere with the liberty of men to do what they like, so long as they do not interfere with their fellows. But this provision is quite distinct from an interference with personal liberty. We are now considering a uniform postal law, and we are perfectly entitled to say what matter the Commonwealth Post-office shall carry. We say to every one - "We shall not interfere with your betting or speculation, but we shall not do anything to assist it. We will not allow the post to be used for that purpose ; and above all, when we see that the post is used to practically throw immense power into the hands of one man, we are still more determined that we will not help him." The great danger is that by means of the post, and by means of regulations, we may practically create a " boss " for Tasmania. We may be creating here in Australia what has been found so dangerous in America, in the shape of men who can practically sway the Parliament and the destinies of a particular State. I have no hesitation in supporting the power proposed to be given to the Postal authorities to interfere with the transmitting and delivery of letters to any sweep promoters. I might say that I have looked at the Act and the regulations which have been passed in Tasmania, and they seem to me to be remarkably helpful to one man. In the Act of 1896, bookmakers are actually forbidden to ply their trade on the race-courses, and the small sweepstakes promoters are also just as effectually crushed out of existence. The Act and the regulations allow only a man with a lot of money to carry on sweepstakes, because it is provided that a deposit of £10,000 must be put down, and there are, of course, very few men who can possibly comply with that condition. I do not understand how two Houses of Parliament in a free State could ever have consented to pass such a Statute, and to approve of such regulations. I do not suppose that the Premier of the State at the time, who has spoken with such fairness and honesty here to-day, had any intention to help any particular man, but those who have been working the oracle have been much too cunning for him, for I know of no scheme better calculated to throw the whole of the gambling in Tasmania, and the greater part of the gambling in the other States, into the hands of one man. I have a statement here, and I would like to know whether it is true, that there was a large public meeting held at Hobart, at which resolutions were carried against "Tattersall's" sweeps, and that no newspaper reported a single line with regard to that meeting.. want to know who owns the newspapers in Tasmania. I do not desire to make any statement upon rumour, but it seems to me to be a most remarkable thing that a meeting of citizens in a free town like Hobart should pass important resolutions, and that there should be no reference to it in any of the newspapers. The newspapers are free to do what they like, but I should like to have the matter explained. It is not because I simply dislike betting that I am going to vote in favour of these clauses. I do not claim any virtue for it, but I hardly ever go to a race meeting, and I never invest in sweeps, nor do I ever bet. It is not, however, because of that, that I am voting in favour of giving the postal authorities the power that is now being sought, but because I think that we ought not to allow the Postal department to be made the means of giving one man, or even several men, so much power. I do not see that Tasmania is going to be much injured by what is now proposed, because, assuming that Tasmania is strongly in favour of retaining Tattersall's" sweeps, which I regard as very doubtful, our legislation must be uniform, if we have it at all. If we have uniform legislation throughout the Commonwealth the result will be that we must permit the transmission and delivery of these letters throughout all the States, and I am quite sure that if
                    had the choice of all the States he would not remain long in Tasmania. If the effect of our uniform legislation should be that the law now in force in Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales is to no longer have effect,
                    would no doubt very quickly move to one of the big centres. He might feel grateful to Tasmania, and he might remain there for a a few months, but he would not allow his gratitude to interfere too much with his interests. I think there has been too much made of State rights in connexion with this question. There is not the slightest doubt that, looking at section 51 of our Constitution, and comparing it with the corresponding section of the United States Constitution, we, having control of the laws for the peace, order, and good government of Australia with regard to postal communication, may say what matter shall be carried through the post. The honorable member for Cowper whose speech we all appreciated for its candour and honesty did not see how he would infringe upon the rights of other States in connexion with his proposed amendment, but I think that he must now understand what the effect of it would be. At the present time under the State laws, in Victoria, we have power not merely to prevent the delivery of letters, but also the transmission of letters from Victoria. If the honorable member's amendment is carried, Victoria will lose her right to prohibit the transmission of letters to Tasmania, otherwise Tasmania cannot have the power which her representatives say she requires. Now, I ask why, if the other States do not wish to transmit and deliver these letters, Tasmania should compel them to do so. The question is not one of interfering with the freedom of Tasmania, but one of Tasmania wishing to interfere with the freedom of the five other States. I feel that I shall not be regarded as supporting these clauses for any bigoted reasons. I am convinced that cash betting is much better than credit betting, and that when a man sends his money to "Tattersall" he parts with his cash and has done with it. There is, I admit, much more danger to a man in the midst of the excitement of a race-course, because he is often induced to bet on what he conceives to be a " dead bird " and then has to find the money to pay for his bet. I have known men, under excitement, when they thought they had a chance of making something, to bet to an extent which they could not reasonably afford, and there is no doubt there is an immense temptation in connexion with this sort of gambling. As the honorable member has put it, it often means trying to pay a debt of honour by incurring a debt of dishonour. On the other hand, every one does not bet with bookmakers, whereas there are many women and children who use Tattersall's sweeps who would not think of approaching a bookmaker. I do not know whether Australia has a national vice, but if she has, it is that of gambling. I do not know of anything that is eating so much into the vitals of our people as the vice of gambling. People say that our gambling propensities are a sign of the excellence and the energy of the breed. I like speculation and enterprise and energy, but I like to see it exerted in the proper channels. At present the energy of the race is being frittered away in a direction that leads to no profit, but involves a great deal of unhappiness and often ruin. The man who goes in for betting makes nothing and produces nothing, but it is simply a matter of passing money from one pocket to another. I doubt very much whether clause 55 will be effective to prevent " Tattersall's " sweeps from being carried on. We are all anxious to make our legislation effective, but this clause is copied to a large extent from the Queensland Act, which has never been tested, and I think we ought to put the matter more shortly and clearly, in the same way as we have done in regard to various matters in the Customs Bill. The first paragraph is only aimed at direct betting, and the second is aimed only against promoters or entrepreneurs of lotteries, and paragraphs (c) and
                    do not touch the matter at all. I should like to see the clause framed in this way : That if the Postmaster-General has reasonable grounds to suppose any person to be engaged in receiving money as contributions or subscriptions towards any lottery or scheme of chance, he may prohibit the transmission of letters addressed to such a person. It may be said that we must make exceptions, as some lotteries are already allowed by law. I am sorry that art unions are allowed in connexion with our churches, for instance. But I do not see that we are unduly interfering with the rights of Tasmania by adopting the proposals contained in this Bill. On the contrary, if looked at from the proper standpoint, it seems to me that Tasmania is attempting to impose upon the other five States the duty of delivering and transmitting matter of which those States do not approve. If there is any need for a further examination of what has been done in America under very similar circumstances, I may point to a passage from a recent book on the Constitution by Randolph Tucker, who, on page 567, says -

                    <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta may have some special knowledge upon the subject ; but, as far as 1. have been able to ascertain, the terms of the present postal convention compel us to transmit to places outside in a matter of this kind. At the same time, the postal convention has to be revised next year. </para>

                        <para>- No, the United States are outside the postal convention so far as the transmission of letters is concerned. When the postal convention meets in Rome next year, the Ministry will be bound - if this clause be passed - to send a delegate to insist upon the keeping out of that convention any obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to transmit letters. Looking at the matter from all sides it will be seen that we are not enacting a stupid and nugatory provision. If we make this clause efficient, we shall be able to say not only that we will not transmit letters within the Commonwealth, but we shall be able to bring pressure to bear upon the Ministry not to sanction an obligation to carry them outside the Commonwealth.. It will thus be seen that the argument that by the adoption of these clauses we shall merely compel "Tattersall" to move to an adjacent island, is not a tenable one. </para>

                        <para>- I only hope that the next Government will be equally amenable to pressure from the two Houses of Parliament, as is this Government. In conclusion, I wish to say that if the Ministry is not inclined to alter the words of clause 55, I should like to move an amendment in this clause to prohibit letters addressed to "Tattersall" being carried within the Commonwealth. I think we may safely leave the matter to Ministerial responsibility if we enact that the Postmaster-General shall have power to prohibit the transmission of such letters if he thinks fit. In some of the State laws the Attorney-General has power to give a permit. I do not quite believe in these permits, but at the same time if it should seem to religious and charitable bodies that it is expedient to have such permits, and if the State legislature does not feel strong enough to put them down, it will be possible even for us to permit certain institutions to carry on. Since the adjournment hour I have been informed on very good authority that all the Protestant churches have resolved that they will have no more of these art unions. I wish to say this in mere justice to them, because when I was first speaking I was under the impression that it was not so. I hope that the Bill will be carried not in a less, but in a more drastic form. </para>

We all know there must be regulations in regard to the carriage of explosives, but i am talking of a parcel which is not dangerous to life or limb. In carrying out any of our regulations, we cannot, unless it be for the detection of crime, interfere with the inviolability of these parcels. </para>

                        <para>- But the letter is to be opened. We have to deal with a very peculiar position. The individual States had a right to use their postal service "in order to carry out effectively the law of the States upon this subject, and the very fact that in most of the States these letters were allowed to go to "Tattersall" in Tasmania is clear proof that there was a moral feeling that while they stopped the delivery of letters of that kind to addresses within their own boundary, they had no right to do so in regard to letters to be transmitted to any other State. When we decided to become a united Australia there was an original compact - I do not say in this instance a legal, but an implied compact - that the rights and privileges which the States retained should still be retained by them without any interference, until they themselves relegated those rights to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the Commonwealth. " Subject to this Constitution." Then the contention comes to this ; that under a mere machinery Bill we can enact indirectly a law which we have no power to make under the Constitution. If we do it in this case to what extent can we not increase our powers ? I know that I am speaking to-night under a heavy disadvantage. 1 am speaking probably against the uniform consciences of a great many of the best people of these communities. I know that I am speaking to-night against the opinion probably of the ablest lawyers in Australia. I will allow that if the United States of America have the power to pass such a law as this the Commonwealth Government have the power to do the same. I should like to draw the attention of honorable members, however - and I speak with great diffidence in a matter of this kind - to the fact that from the time of Chief Justice Marshall to the present day there has been a system of gradually enlarging the powers of the central Government in the United States. While I admit that the ablest lawyers of America have declared emphatically and without reserve that this clause can be put into a Postal Bill, still I do not think that, from a legal point of view, we have a right to take all United States judgments as guiding us. Above all things, in the starting of a Constitution like this, in a matter in which State rights are affected, I say most emphatically that we should look, not merely to. the legal view of the question, but to the moral position of the whole affair, and as to the way in which we ought to » deal with a question like this, connected as it is with the different States. We are told that this sweep system "can be suppressed even if it is legal in the States. I would ask the Minister in charge of the Bill - Are we to understand in the first place that " Tattersall " is covered by paragraph (6) ? I understand that "Tattersall" is brought under the category of lotteries on account of the mode in which the prizes are drawn. </para>

                        <para>- The control of the Tariff is a matter absolutely taken over by the Commonwealth. But, by passing these clauses, we are trying to override, in an indirect way, the constitutionally expressed desire of the people of Tasmania. Much as I deplore the evil of gambling, even if I admitted that the power to pass legislation such as we are now passing, had been handed over to us under the Constitution, I would say that, as a matter of common-sense expediency and fairness, we had no right to perpetrate an injustice to any State of the Commonwealth. Although honorable members may confront me with the judgments which have been given in America, and may be perfectly satisfied that, as a matter of dry law, I a,m wrong, that is my opinion. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. This. Parliament is under obligation in such matters only to a majority of the people of the Commonwealth. If Tasmania has rights in this matter, so have the other and larger States. Before federation they had the right to frame postal laws affecting lotteries, and they did so. They said, through their legislation, that they would not allow lotteries to be carried on by means of the Post-office. The other States have as clear a right to prohibit the carriage of correspondence relating to lotteries as Tasmania has to have it carried. That being so, surely the majority must rule, and four or five of the States have already determined that they will not allow the Post-office to be used to facilitate gambling transactions. If the State rights of Tasmania are to be admitted, a wrong must be done to every other State. I am not prepared to concede that Tasmania has any State right to which the rights of the other States must give way. The laws of the Commonwealth must be uniform. The provision which we are now considering was never intended for the suppression of gambling. All we are asked to say is that the Post-office shall take no hand in the distribution of correspondence relating to gambling transactions. The whole question is whether we have a right to say what matter shall pass through the Post office of the Commonwealth. If we have that right, we can determine what shall or shall not go into Tasmania, just as we can determine what shall or shall not go into the other States of the union. Under the Bill, Tasmania would have just the same rights as the other States, and she cannot claim more. If she is given the same rights as the other States, I cannot see that any injustice is done to her. The question of State rights was a fair matter for argument when the Federal Convention was sitting, but it is surely not a matter for argument, now. Tasmania knew, when she accepted the Constitution, that she would have to» submit to the laws made by the Commonwealth for the regulation of the Post-office. She knew that she .was surrendering her State control of the Post-office. </para>

                        <para>- We are not legislating on lotteries. The people of Tasmania and of the other States may carry on lotteries and other forms of gambling until the end of time, so far as this Bill . is concerned. All we say is that we will not facilitate gambling by allowing correspondence relating to it to be carried through the Post-office. The Minister who represents the Postmaster-General said that we should consider this matter from the "view-point of Tasmania, but we have no more right to consider it from the viewpoint of Tasmania than from the view-point of the other States. We have to consider it as it affects the majority of the people of "the Commonwealth, and, believing as I do that the majority of the people of the Commonwealth would to-morrow vote for the provisions contained in the Bill, I say that this Parliament has a direction to re-enact the provisions which already obtain in many of the States, and which it is now proposed to apply to the whole Commonwealth. The legislation of New South Wales in this respect differs from that of Queensland, and, I believe, from that of Victoria. In New South Wales we did not prohibit the transmission of correspondence relating to gambling; we prohibited only the delivery of such correspondence to a proscribed address. It lias repeatedly been said that we shall not put an end to gambling, or limit its extent and volume, by passing these clauses ; but, if that is so, it seems strange that the gentleman who is principally concerned has gone to all the expense of getting up the enormous petitions which have been presented against them. </para>

I desire to say a word or two as to the way in which petitions against the clauses were signed. We were told by some honorable members, with quite a flourish, that some ministers of religion had signed these petitions. Unfortunately, that is too true, but it is not true that these ministers, for the most part, signed them knowing what they meant. They did so under the belief that we were going to take power to open anybody's and everybody's letters for any purpose whatever. Here is a clergyman, the Rev.

                        <para>- I am amazed to hear it. After all, the question we have to consider is whether as a matter of public policy this correspondence ought to be carried through the post. Four or five of the States have already declared that such correspondence ought to be stopped, and now we are face to face with the necessity of either bringing Tasmania into line with the other States Or compelling the other States, against their own express will, to act according to the Tasmanian view. I believe in the rule of the majority, and as Tasmania entered into this bargain knowing that she must absolutely surrender the control of the Post-office to the Commonwealth, she has no right to turn round now and complain that we are filching  away from her any of her State rights. She can do as she likes so far as her gambling laws are concerned, and she can carry on "Tattersall's" still. </para>

                        <para>- We will not allow the Post-office to be used for the purpose of facilitating gambling transactions. We are forced to this action in the interests of the good government of the Commonwealth as a whole, and all this talk about invading Tasmanian State rights is beside the question. If we concede the so-called State rights now claimed by Tasmania, we shall inflict a State wrong on the other parties to the union, and since the majority must rule, and the feeling of the majority has already found expression, no injury or injustice can be done to any one State in the way that has been indicated by some honorable members. Quite apart from "Tattersall's" or Tasmanian rights, or anything else, I claim that the Post-office ought not to be used for the purpose of facilitating gambling transactions. I believe that "Tattersall's" sweep is a species of gambling of the most pernicious kind, and that it is doing a great deal to undermine and detract from the fibre of the young people of Australia. When we believe that the Commonwealth can rest only upon the mental, moral, and physical fibre of the units of the community we have the right to take such steps as we believe are necessary for the preservation of a healthy public life, and take away all temptation from our young people. For that reason I believe that the Commonwealth is pursuing its proper function in taking such steps as will prevent the use of our Post-office for carrying on this traffic. The good government of the people includes a thorough regard for the moral welfare of the community. </para>

                    <para>In these few words lies the whole kernel of the matter. The Commonwealth of Australia is now established. The question of the postal facilities has been removed entirely from the purview and control of any individual State, and it was a mistaken argument to use in a Federal Parliament - and it would be futile if persevered in - that we are to regard States as States when we are considering the exercise of our federal powers. When we are legislating, I trust that we shall hear nothing of State rights, and nothing save in respect of the welfare of the people of Australia as a whole. I do not go so far as the honorable member for Parramatta, who says that we are to consider what is best for the majority absolutely, and to disregard the welfare and rights of the Tasmanian people because they are in a minority. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that I misunderstood the honorable member. But I say that, in federal jurisdiction, States are not to be considered at all but the individuals who comprise the Australian nation. The honorable member for Wentworth said that, from the time of Chief Justice Marshall up to the present, the Supreme Court had gone on enlarging the sphere of the American Constitution That is not quite accurate. The Supreme Court of the United States had several stages in its construction of the Constitution. At one time it took the national construction, at others it took the narrow or State construction. If it had adhered to the broad construction right through I believe that the tremendous calamity of the Civil war would have been averted. It was the narrow State construction, combined with the fatal principle of State rights dominating the Federal Legislature, which brought about that terrible conflict which cost* the nation millions of lives and of treasure. </para>

                        <para>- The Dred Scott case is a startling example. In that case the Chief Justice said from the bench that no black man had any rights which a white man was bound to respect. But in some of the States the1 change of feeling within a few years was so great that black men were actually making the laws which white men were bound to obey. I do hope that we shall not start by fettering our federal powers, and that we shall insist that we have those powers if we think it expedient and just to the Australian people to exercise them. The next question is - " Is it expedient and right " ? So far as I can see, I think it is in the highest degree expedient that we should support the principle embodied in this clause. I know of no influence more subtle or insidious or more destructive to industrial habits and industrial thought, and to the conservation of national energy, than the spread of the gambling spirit. I think that we ought to be at one in endeavouring if not directly to suppress it, at all events in refusing to aid the dissemination of materials by which it is propagated and assisted, and we ought to be unanimous in supporting the clause now proposed by the Government. </para>

While we have a few irregularities here and difficulties there, we must consider what is, on the whole, the best for us all. Not only 'do I heartily support the clause as it is framed - and in that I do not speak of its drafting, but of the principle which it contains, because I think its form is susceptible of some improvement - but I would willingly support the Government or any honorable member who chooses to move, in going even further in the same direction.

                        <para>- I accept the right honorable gentleman's explanation. Other honorable members have certainly said that it is a security to the public. But what kind of a security can it be either to the people who invest in these sweeps, or to the Government, when the sums involved amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds annually? It was one of the conditions under which this monopoly - for it is a monopoly - was given to " Tattersall " by the Government at a time when it was in need of money that the sum of £10,000 should be deposited. It is a pity that this thing should ever have originated in the island State, and it will be a still greater pity if some measure is not taken to terminate its existence as soon as possible. What might it not become ? Already we know that the power of " Tattersall " is great and constantly growing. We have only to look at the opposition which has been got up against this clause in order to see the power which can be wielded by this institution. We know the power which "Tattersall" wields in New South Wales, where that institution no longer exists. If the institution goes on, instead of having a federation of six States in this Commonwealth, we shall have a confederation of five States and "Tattersall's" Island. " Tattersall " is getting mortgages over property in all parts of Tasmania, and wielding an influence over public men, while this revenue of £15,000 per annum is being obtained by pandering to the gambling proclivities of the people. I feel very warmly that the Commonwealth should, in passing a Postal Bill, take the right of deciding what matter it shall carry through the post. Private letters will not be opened and interfered with, as has been suggested. The intention is clearly set forth in the clause that only letters proscribed as being addressed to people who are reasonably supposed to be carrying on these sweeps shall be opened for the purpose of seeing whether the law is being evaded. The power we are taking is not one that should be in a Postal Bill. We have already taken power to deal with obscene or indecent literature, and I do not know that any objection was made to that. </para>

                        <para>- These sealed documents are not in the nature of private correspondence, but are only replies or applications for tickets. In passing the clause dealing with obscene or indecent printing we admitted that in these machinery Bills, including the Customs Bill, we can safeguard the morals of the community. It lias been said that this form of gambling is different from other forms and removes temptations, and that we can regulate it so as to find a safety-valve for the speculative tendencies of the people. Those who elevate " Tattersall's" into a kind of special providence, with whom the people may gamble on safe terms, seem to forget that side by side with the application for tickets, " Tattersall" is issuing circulars and advertisements, tempting people to invest, just in the same way as an ordinary betting man. I admit that betting men and tote shops are evils just as great as sweeps, and if we had power to do away with them, we ought to do it. The Federal Parliament has no power to deal with tote shops and betting men, but we have power to regulate the Post-office, and that is a power we are fully justified in using in the interests of good order and the moral and material welfare of the people. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely true. The honorable member polled 1,992 No. 1 votes, and. I polled over 4,000 No. 1 votes ; and, therefore, I have twice the right to speak on this question that he has. I speak for the morality of Tasmania. I would, ask honorable members whether nations are built up upon gambling and horse-racing ? When we speak of the greatness of a country we do not speak of her armies or of her navies, but of the moral men and women she produces, and that is what we want to cultivate in Tasmania. When the time comes that Tasmania cannot live without " Tattersall," may she eternally sink in the depths of the ocean. She is the richest State of the union, and not the pauper State that some honorable members seem to think. At the same time, I think the Commonwealth ought to agree to put £15,000 on the Estimates to make up what Tasmania is going to lose. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I think it would be a fair thing. No doubt we have been exploiting all the other States, but the more one has the more he wants, and the less one has the less he will get. The Commonwealth, which has the supreme power, rose out of the States as the Himalayas rise above the plain. The Commonwealth has the power, if it chooses, to destroy "Tattersall," but whether it will use that power I cannot say. In connexion with every community there is something that ought to be preserved, and something that ought to be destroyed, and every patriot and every true man desires to destroy that which is bad and preserve that which is good. The very exterior of nature may be withered and wasted ; the very earth itself may be blasted and blighted by unproductiveness, and towns and villages may be swept by flames, and whole armies of human beings may be swallowed in their hellish embrace ; but all such calamities sink into insignificance beside a national act of wrong, and it would be a national wrong to allow one little State to exist as a parasite. </para>

                    <para>- It is not my intention to occupy the attention of the committee at any great length. AVe have had some excellent speeches, and I do not think the time spent in the discussion of this matter has been wasted. That phase of the question which refers to the Tasmanian loss in connexion with this matter has been very much overstated, in my opinion. I am one of those who think that all the States are making a very big sacrifice in regard to their revenue, and I have yet to learn that Tasmania is going to lose more in connexion with this matter than any of the other States. The loss of revenue to the other States will be very much greater in the aggregate than will be the loss of Tasmania, because the whole of Tasmania's revenue from this institution is drawn from the post-offices of the other States. Exchange has to be paid on the postal notes in every instance in addition to the stamps used. It is not a question of the suppression of gambling in the broadest sense. The question that appeals to me is whether we have the right in this Parliament to facilitate gambling by using the huge postal machine for the advantage of one particular individual. All the other State issues have, to my mind, very little to do with the question. I take up a very decided stand, and say that these clauses are undoubtedly within the functions of this Parliament, and are no infringement of State rights. The Post-office has been given up to the Commonwealth, and we have a perfect right to say that it shall not be used to assist this or any other particular monopoly. I am therefore going to vote for the retention of these clauses. I. do not wish to say any more. There has been quite enough said on both sides, but I do not want to give a silent vote on this question. I believe we have every constitutional right to do this ; that it is no infringement of any State right ; and that each State will make a sacrifice in its revenue equal to that which Tasmania will make. </para>

                    BRADDON (Tasmania). - I would like to ask whether this clause would cover postal matter addressed to a bookmaker ; I think it does. There are some 200 or more bookmakers registered both in Victoria and in New South Wales, and there is no difficulty about ascertaining who they are and what they are, and the question is whether correspondence addressed to them should be brought under the ban of this clause. It would seem to be the obvious intention of the clause that this measure of justice - or injustice - should be applied equally to bookmakers as to those who run sweeps or conduct gambling in any other form.

                <para>I have already stated that I desire to protect the State rights of Tasmania. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Indi have pointed out that by adopting this amendment we should be giving power in the Bill which would have the effect of overriding the existing law of the State of Queensland. It is a fact that the Queensland Legislature passed a Postal Act in 1891 which gave power to the Postmaster-General to intercept letters addressed to sweep promoters either in Queensland or elsewhere, but I am informed on very reliable authority that the power was never used - that is to say, that letters addressed to "Tattersalls " in Tasmania have been sent and are still being sent through the Post-office of Queensland. So that the contention that we are overriding or interfering with the State rights of Queensland does not apply. Then again, so far as the Postal Act of Victoria is concerned the provision applies only to letters addressed to persons within the State. </para>

                        <para>- I will not argue that the power is not there, but I* am sure that it is not exercised, and that letters have been sent to " Tattersalls " in Tasmania ever since it has* been established there. {."Although strictly speaking we may be technically interfering with State rights, we are not doing so in practice, because such rights have never been exercised. That is an answer also to the honorable member for Lang, who drew attention to the fact that the State laws had never been altered. The reason is that the Postmasters-General have not dared to put the law into practice. </para>

                    (Ballarat - Attorney-General). - I hope the committee will realize that the effect of the amendment moved by the honorable member, in a very temperate and fair speech, would be to precisely negative the whole intention of this clause. We are allowing a clause to stand on the face of the measure, claiming the undoubted right of the Federal Parliament to have the absolute and exclusive control of its post-offices, which it is expressly endowed with. Having declared by the clause the undoubted power of the Commonwealth, we are now asked to provide that the Postmaster-General, as the agent of the Commonwealth, should not be permitted to exercise it except by prohibiting correspondence in relation to fortune-telling, or fraudulent,indecent, obscene, or immoral businesses. In regard to all other kinds of gambling through the Post-office, whether by bookmakers or lottery conductors, or by those carrying on schemes or games of chance, or any other variety of gambling, the Federal Parliament would be crippling itself, and placing its powers absolutely at the disposal or under the control of any of the States of the Union. The honorable member's amendment aims at compelling any States, no matter what their desires may be, as to the control of the postal matter passing through their territory, to send to any State to which it may be addressed any postal matter relating to any lottery or gambling business, provided that in the State to which it is addressed the carrying and receipt of such correspondence may have been legalized. This would, therefore, effectually protect Tasmania in regard to "Tattersall's," and it would leave the other States free to start rivals to " Tattersall's," and require correspondence addressed to them to go as freely through Tasmania as Tasmanian correspondence would be passed through the other States. It would absolutely require every State to send to Tasmania any correspondence relating to its sweeps. The committee will, therefore, realize that this amendment would add to a clause, which is a declaration of federal rights, an absolute subjection of federal rights and powers in its Post-office to the will of any State in the Union.

                    BRADDON (Tasmania). - I do not follow the Attorney-General entirely, nor do I think he has taken sufficient cognisance of the fact that each State should have complete jurisdiction over its own social legislation. To my mind it is no more in keeping with the Constitution that the Federal Parliament should indirectly, through this Postal Bill, take the power to proscribe any harmless form of gambling, or any form of gambling whatever, than that it should assume the power to lay down the law in any State with regard to compulsory vaccination or free education or any. other matter. To my mind there is something very repellant in the idea that the Commonwealth Parliament should arrogate to itself the right of saying that in this or that State such and such social laws shall be enforced because we choose to enforce them indirectly by means of a Post and Telegraph Bill. I hope that the amendment will be carried, and that the wrong which will otherwise be imposed on all the States will be. avoided.

                    <para>- It is scarcely to be regretted that the honorable member has been able to move this amendment, because I think it brings out in the clearest possible way one of the very two serious questions involved in the proposals of the Government, namely, that as to rights of States. I hope that we shall always be very jealous of the rights of the States, especially of the rights of those States which may, perhaps, be called the weaker from the point of view of population, voting power, and representation. I trust that we shall always act towards them in a. fair and generous spirit - not in even a technical spirit. If I thought that in any technical sense the rights of any States were invaded by the clauses in the Bill, in spite of the very strong view which I entertain as to the wisdom and necessity of the provision, I should act in defence of the rights of the States. But I have never been able to see that any States could have avoided knowing that in handing over the post and telegraph offices to the Commonwealth, the power of dealing with such questions was also handed over. It is a power not to be exercised lightly, because I hope we shall, always be jealous of - any interference with the free transmission of correspondence through . the Post-office. But in this . case, upon very broad and high national ground, I am in favour of. the clause. I feel no difficulty at all in regard to the amendment, which I shall certainly vote against. </para>

                    (Cowper). - I wish to point out that it is not only the State of Tasmania which is concerned, In my desire to save time, I omitted to mention that the Postal Acts of the different States contain a proviso preserving, anything which has been legalized by them. Unless some such, proviso is inserted here, art unions, which have been considered legal in New South Wales, and also the disposal of works of art by lottery, will be prohibited. In New South Wales, not long since, a Bill was passed giving the Eight Hours Demonstration Committee power to dispose of certain works on. the art union principle. That Act, I take it, will be overridden by the clause, so that I have more than one object in view in pressing this amendment!

                    of.- clause 55. The words which- we struck out were "not sanctioned by law." Do : these words mean " unlawful " under the laws ofl the Commonwealth, because- 1 take it that we cannot declare, any tiling to be unlawful which is permitted under the gaming laws of the various States.? What did those words "not sanctioned by law " refer to ? Did: they mean not sanctioned by the Jaw of the States, or not sanctioned by the law of the Commonwealth? The Commonwealth certainly has e not- the right to make any law under our Constitution connected with, or in any way dealing with gambling, or, with the gaming laws. Those laws are left to the States. I submit that there is such a large element of doubt as to what law is referred to in clause 55 that it would, be inadvisable to rule this proviso out of order.
