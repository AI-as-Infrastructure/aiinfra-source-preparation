                        <para>- That this Tariff will tax unduly the pioneers and prospectors throughout the country to whom it gives no compensation whatever. I think the right honorable gentleman has admitted that, but if I am wrong I shall be very glad to correct the statement. I shall use the Treasurer's own figures to demonstrate how iniquitous this duty is. The right honorable gentleman's estimate is that, in a normal year, Western Australia will pay ?6,250 on condensed milk. That is, 190, 000 people in the western state are to pay on condensed milk half as much as 1,400,000 people in New South Wales. With one-seventh of Victoria's population, we are to pay about ?3,500 more; with one third of Queensland's numbers we are to contribute ?1,500 more than that State. Our share is ?4,375 more than that of South Australia, though we have only half her population; while, as regards Tasmania, whose population is a few thousands less than ours, we pay ?6,250 against her ?625. To put it another way, still using the Treasurer's figures as a basis, one miner in Western Australia will pay on condensed milk more than fourteen miners in Victoria, more than nine in Tasmania, equal to seven in South Australia, and to four in New South Wales and Queensland. This is surely a monstrous inequality. Have we not a right to expect that "a Tariff of all the talents," even if its burden of taxation be unavoidably heavy, shall adjust that burden equitably? But the figures which I have just given do not disclose the full iniquity of this tax. It has now come to be generally admitted that the Treasurer has understated the probable revenue: </para>

                        <para>- I think it was . about 6£d. per tin, but, since this Tariff has been introduced, the cost has been put up to 8d. per tin. I have been informed that during the last ,few weeks the price has come down to 7id. for the lib. tin in Western Australia. Of course, tinned milk is one of those lines the price of which storekeepers will cut to a very fine point. </para>

                        <para>- Not since the right honorable gentleman put a tax upon it. It is rather a curious thing, which I may mention here, that some prospectors in the northern portion of Western Australia some time ago laid the foundations of a new town, and gave it the name of " Kingston," in honour of the right honorable the Minister of Trade and Customs. That was before the Federal Tariff came into operation. But since then the miners and prospectors of that place propose to reconsider the name. </para>

                        <para>- They propose to call it "Tariff-town.'' Possibly, honorable members will obtain a clearer conception of the exact position if I tabulate the cost respectively of landing £100 worth of tinned milk in Fremantle, from London or Antwerp, as compared with the cost of landing £100 worth from Melbourne. As the Tariff on which we are employed is likely to be permanent, I should be justified in excluding from this calculation the operation of the temporary duties now in existence in Western Australia, but because I do not desire to do anything that is not perfectly fair, or to exclude any revelant factor, I am including the sliding scale in the comparison. The charges on £100 worth of condensed milk imported into Western Australia from abroad would be under this Tariff as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- As we have seen, the charges, including the duty, on £100 worth of foreign milk amount to £50 3s. 6d. per cent., and the local article enjoys a preference in this respect equal to over 42 per cent. In other words that is the advantage which the local product now enjoys in five out of six States within the Commonwealth. The advantage to the Australian product entering Western Australia will be, in the first year, £30 15s. per cent., and, allowing for the duty on sugar, about 23 per cent. I am speaking of the proposal of the Minister for Trade and Customs to impose 11/2d. per lb. ; and this preference increases yearly for five years, until, on the disappearance of the sliding scale, after all charges are met, and assuming that sugar continues to bear a duty of £6 per ton, it becomes 38 per cent. If the Australian product be, as its advocates say in the circular, "superior to any imported in Europe," its inherent superiority should enable it to get along comfortably without such a heavy tax to the consumer as 38 per cent. The question is forced on one-: Is this company's demand for such a monstrous impost consistent with its claims to superiority? Does the industry here pay wages 38 per cent. higher than are paid by the English companies who manufacture this commodity ? </para>

                        <para>- That I should say depends upon the skill and aptitude of the men employed. If the honorable member is going to take into consideration the highly paid expert at £1,000 a year, and bulking in his salary with the wages paid to the workmen, divide the total up into a so called average, I hope he will not expect the committee to accept such a calculation. I must accept the statement of the honorable member that the wages in Victoria in this local industry are three times higher than what they are in England. </para>

                    <para>Years ago the only canned meats handled in Western Australia to any extent were the produce of America. To-day, with the exception of certain lines, which are not packed in Australia, the Australian packed article holds the market without any extra protection in duty, and at prices over 10 per cent. higher than can be obtained for the American goods. We have for the last four or five years given one firm of packers in Sydney an open order for all they could pack for Western Australia, and have handled for them not less than many thousands of cases per annum. To-day, notwithstanding the fact of the prohibitive duty of 2d. per lb. on foreign meats, we cannot sell the American packed article, canned by one of the best known firms in the States, at 10 per cent. less than our Australian article. This line needed no protection in our market, where the bulk of it is consumed, but obtains higher prices, and the bulk of the trade in open competition and at the same duty. Why ? Because it is the article best suited to the requirements of the people who use it. </para>

                        <para>- The 15s. per head includes the duty. That is an enormous impost to pay. As I have shown already, one miner in Western Australia is paying on this item alone as "much as fourteen miners in Victoria have to pay, and still we cannot obtain any justification for the duty from the Minister for Trade and Customs. I ask the committee to reduce this oppressive tax to £d. per lb. My amendment, if carried, will protect the revenue, and give to the local article all the incidental encouragement it can reasonably ask. Under the proposal of the Government - and here I would invite the particular attention of the Treasurer - the sugar in a case of imported milk will pay 3s., and that in the local article ls. 4d. My amendment taxes the sugar in a case of imported milk at ls. 6d., the tax on the sugar in the local article being still ls. 4d. Thus on the sugar contents alone the local article will receive a preference of 2d. per case. </para>

                        <para>- I shall make it as easily as possible for the honorable member to review my figures by telling him how I arrive at them. If the honorable member chooses to work out the difference between the tax of ls. 4d. and ls. 6d. on £100 worth of milk, he will find what it represents. The foreign article will pay considerably more on its sugar than does the local article. I need not go into the other advantages, because I assume that Australian produced milk has - as the circular issued by the Anglo-Australian Company states - certain advantages in its favour. That circular speaks of the superior pastures of Australia. The superiority of its pastures, and the other splendid opportunities which the local company enjoys should be sufficient to enable it to get along without such a heavy tax upon the people. </para>

                        <para>- No. The local industry has many other advantages, as I have tried to show. Its market is at its doors, and thus it escapes heavy freights and charges. It has also an abundance of cheap land, which the foreign producer does not possess. Considering its natural advantages and the Tariff preference which we propose to give on its sugar elements alone, I submit my amendment as an honorable, fair, and reasonable compromise, and I earnestly hope the committee will see their way to adopt it.

                    <para>- The honorable member for Coolgardie has gone into this question in a thorough manner, and I think the amendment moved by him bears on the face of it the fact that it is even more than a reasonable compromise. I wish to put the question plainly before the committee. On various occasions demands have been made here on behalf of the pioneers of Australia - the bush workers and the miners, and other large sections of the community in the interior. These demands apply not only to Western Australia, but to all portions of the union. The answer that we have received in the past has been that the Treasurer would like to comply with these requests, but that he is unable to do so owing to the revenue aspect of the question. Prom to-day, however, that consideration is removed. We are told in well informed circles that the Treasurer will receive something like 3,000,000 in excess of his estimates for the year. </para>

                <para>Mr. WILKS. - Here is the difference between honorable members of the Opposition and the exploiters on the other side, I would say, if I were unkind enough to do so. While we admit that in order to obtain revenue certain articles of general consumption must be taxed, nevertheless we contend that the lighter the taxation imposed the better will it be for the people and the Commonwealth itself. The Treasurer has now had two months experience of the receipts not during a normal, but during an abnormal, period. It is reasonable to suppose that the disliked and ill used importer anticipated this Tariff, and imported large quantities of goods prior to its imposition. </para>

                        <para>- That is a mere assertion. We have been told that the importers throughout the Commonwealth have anticipated the Tariff, therefore it cannot be said that the revenue received during the last two months represents the returns for an abnormal period. The honorable member for Coolgardie pointed out clearly that Western Australia, with a population of 190,000, will contribute £6,250 to the total revenue of £28,750 which the Treasurer estimates to receive from this item. The impost is entirely new to New South Wales, and I find that the people of that State will contribute £12,500 to the total revenue expected from this item, or, in other words, 43 per cent., although they represent only 33 per cent. of the population of the Commonwealth. This item is not even a fair compromise between the States. The honorable member for Coolgardie has pointed out the iniquitous way in which Western Australia is treated in regard to this impost, and when the figures relating to New South Wales are considered, it will be seen at once how unfair this duty is. Preserved milk has hitherto entered free into New South Wales; in Victoria there has been a duty of 2d. per lb., and the Government's idea of a compromise is to reduce the former Victorian impost by1/2d. per lb., and to place upon New South Wales a new burden of taxation of 1½d. per lb. Queensland formerly had a duty of 2d. per lb., so that under this Tariff she will gain ½d. per lb., and be in the same position as Victoria. The people of South Australia, however, will have to pay a duty of l£d. per lb. instead of Id. per lb. as formerly, so that they suffer a loss instead of making a gain. These facts show that this duty cannot be defended on the ground that it is a compromise on the rates hitherto prevailing in the several States. The people will have this burden placed upon their shoulders solely in the interests of a Victorian manufacturer. </para>

                        <para>- The estimated revenue from Victoria in respect of this item is £2,812 per annum, as against £12,500 from New South Wales, £6,250 from Western Australia, and £4,688 from Queensland. This indicates that the duty is not in the interests of residents of Victoria, but in the interests of manufactories established here. Either the Government are imposing the duty for revenue purposes, or to uphold what they term a substantial industry. If they are imposing it merely for protectionist purposes they should say so. The Minister for Trade and Customs has advocated the claims of the pioneer, the miners, and the bush workers before, and if he wishes to help them he has an opportunity to do so now by reducing this item. If the duty is for revenue purposes, then the Opposition ask the Government to accept the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Coolgardie. If honorable members from New South Wales were the rash free-traders that some would have us believe, they would fight strenuously to secure the placing of the item on the free list in view of the fact that preserved milk f formerly entered free into New South Wales. In the interests of the Commonwealth, however, we are willing to accept the compromise proposed by the honorable  member for Coolgardie. If this is intended to be a protectionist duty, however, I should like to hear an answer to the question put by the honorable member for Coolgardie to the honorable member for Mernda, namely - " What is the extent of the labour connected with the industry?" The argument has been used that this is an article of consumption largely used by working miners and pioneers, but it is largely used also by artisans and the working classes generally. I think that those classes will be prepared to consider a duty of ¾d. a fair compromise. Judging from what has taken place at public meetings, these people do not want any patronage. If revenue has to be obtained through the Customs, they desire to pay their fair share, and all they desire is a fair compromise - taxation upon an equitable basis - and a duty of fulfill secure that. </para>

                    <para>- I hope honorable members will be content to allow the item to stand as the Government proposed it. I have listened with interest to the observations made by honorable members, and to some remarks personal to myself. It has been suggested that my past history would not justify honorable members in expecting this, that, and the other thing. All I can say in reply is that I hope my past history would not justify the recommendation of anything that is not capable of recommendation. One would have thought, to hear the eloquent way in which the honorable member for Coolgardie was discoursing, that there was a proposal under federation by which Western Australia, the golden-slippered Cinderella of the group, was to be taxed higher than she was taxed before. </para>

All the members from Western Australia appear to be at one upon this matter, one rises to speak, and the others cheer him, while he draws the gloomiest picture of the pioneer seated on his deserted log, sighing before his expiring bush fire, and reflecting how evil federation has been in that he is being taxed more on his;preserved milk than he was before. He is not so taxed. I may tell honorable members that I am getting a little bit sick of hearing the pioneers claimed for only one State. I have the honour to represent a State that, equally with Western Australia, possesses pioneers. All the States have a similar class of men, and have equal occasion to be proud of them. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the prices generally quoted are 18s. 6d. and 17s. 6d. and comparing the number of cases imported and the invoice value stated, it is clear that the prices quoted in Western Australia are less. Honorable members cannot get away from the fact that in this matter we are being exposed to very keen competition, and added to this there is the competition of cheaper labour, and the difference in the value of the sugar used in the manufacture of the article. It is not merely a question of the difference in the duty upon sugar. I am informed that the sugar used in the manufacture of the article here is of the best quality, quoted in Melbourne at '£21 per ton, while the price of beet sugar in London and elsewhere, used for a similar purpose, is only from £8 to £9 pelton. It must be recollected that there is from 40 to 50 per cent, of sugar in condensed milk, and honorable members will find that the difference against the local, manufacturer amounts to from £11 to £12 in. the ton of sugar, or taking it in another way, to £5 or £6 on a ton of preserved milk. Put in another way, still it is a difference of about -1/2 d. per ' lb. on the milk itself. All that we propose to give by way of protection in this respect closely approximates to that amount. If there is an industry which is deserving of every possible encouragement in this connexion it is this industry. It is not as though one State only was concerned. Queensland produces this article. There is as excellent an article manufactured there as we could wish. I have a letter here referring to the factory at Cressbrook, which is the only one that has so far been a success.

                    <para>We give our farmers 4Jd. a gallon for milk all the year round, which is a better price than they can obtain anywhere else. Being able to guarantee them this price, we are able to settle a num-ber of people, principally from the southern colonies, on our lands at a good price per acre. This, I take it, is a considerable help to the Queensland Government, and the colony in general, as establishing a price for land. </para>

                    <para>- It is rather amusing that the last statement quoted by the Minister for Trade and Customs was from a document alleging that a certain meeting had taken place, and that a certain gentleman had given the views of the people of Illawarra. But I may tell him that that gentleman was defeated at the last election by a free-trader, who, I presume, represents the district, and is better fitted to voice the sentiments of its people. It is very refreshing to freetraders to find that, in order to bolster up their case, the protectionists have to admit two or three very salient facts which we have enunciated for many years. In the first place they have to confess that in all protectionist countries the tendency is to reduce wages. </para>

                        <para>Not a protectionist country has been referred to by honorable members which they have not said is governed in such a way under the protective system that the labourer gets about only half the remuneration which is paid in Australia. It is also admitted that when a country over-produces, the manufacturers have to sell to the foreigner at a less rate than to their own people, and their own people are sweated for the sake of the foreigner. Let us look at this question from a little broader point of view than the Minister has done. In many instances we have to fight a battle, which I might call, despite all the boasts of others, the battle of democracy against monopoly. I think the Minister will do me the justice to admit that I have not attempted to put many articles on the free list, but have adhered to the compact we made that we must have revenue without destruction. I have been willing in most cases to compromise. I think the compromise of the honorable member for Coolgardie does not go far enough, but, at the same time, as he has moved an amendment, I do not intend to move for a lower rate. But what is the distinction we have to draw in regard to many of the items we are considering? We have to draw a distinction between certain articles which enter into moderate use among the people, and those which are of universal use throughout Australia. It seems to me an absolute crime to make dearer an article like preserved milk, which is used very largely throughout the interior of Australia. Are we making a Tariff for the people in the towns who have gas, electricity, fresh milk, and every comfort and luxury ? Here is an article on which many thousands of the primary producers depend, for, as we all know, tea is a universal drink in the country. I am not advocating the abolition of the duty on milk, but I am pointing out that when we come to certain industries which represent a mere handful of men, as against the 4,000,000 inhabitants of Australia, it is not democracy to impose so heavy a duty. Let us see how the duty affects the port of Sydney. In1899, New South Wales imported 3,526,575 lbs. of preserved milk, valued at £66,855. At a duty of l1/2d. per lb., that quantity would have yielded £22,041 to the Government ; but their own estimate of revenue from this duty is £12,500. In other words, they are looking forward to the reduction of the imports into that State by 43 per cent. </para>

                <para>Victoria is an extreme mad thing, which has neither reason nor sense in it. Some of the rates which have been imposed in Victoria have acted in a prohibitory way; and now, forsooth, they want to compare these duties as a matter of average with the duties in free-trade New South Wales and in other States. It is an absolute injustice. It is an absolute breach of contract, with regard to the way of looking at these things. If we were to carry our free-trade principles out in this committee, we should move for the abolition of several of these duties, bub we have not done so. </para>

Does this carry out the compact which has been made with the people of Australia - is this the moderate protection of such representatives as the honorable member for Gwydir or the Minister for Home Affairs when they were before the electors? Nothing of the kind. The whole of this Tariff is based on the extreme protectionist policy of Victoria. </para>

As honorable members know, we have passed several items in this division, but the duty now proposed is absolutely opposed to the principle of democracy, and is directed against the interests of millions of people in the interior of Australia</para>

                    <para>- Condensed milk is one of those articles which may be regarded as a symbol of the protectionist system and its bottle-fed industries. If anything, the honorable member for Coolgardie did not go far enough. Seventeen and a-half per cent. protection, such as will be afforded the industry under the proposal of the honorable member, plus the freight and other charges to which the imported article is subject, should be sufficient for the local manufacturers, and is certainly a heavy tax upon an absolute necessary of life to those who live in the interior. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to say a few words, mainly because the honorable member for Coolgardie so pointedly referred to me. I think it is rather unfortunate that honorable members should adopt this method of discussing public questions, because it must be quite clear that, as we go on, the rights of several honorable members to speak on specific items may very well be challenged. I propose to confine myself to imparting to the committee some little information which may enable them to form a sound judgment on this question. I regret very much that I was unable to follow the figures of the honorable member for Coolgardie, because he quoted the money values instead of quantities. The honorable member referred to the preserved milk industry as belonging to Victoria, but as a matter of fact it has assumed very much larger dimensions in New South. Wales and Queensland. It is, however, distinctly an industry of the soil. Honorable members on the other side of the chamber are constantly talking of the necessity of encouraging primary industries, and this is essentially one of those industries, because the whole of the contents of the preserved milk, namely, sugar and milk, are produced within the Commonwealth. The only foreign materials used in connexion with the industry are the tinplate and the timber used in the packing. Some honorable members have inquired as to the number of men who are employed in the condensed milk factories. But the employes there bear a very small proportion to the total, number of those who are directly or indirectly engaged in the industry. The farmers who produce the milk, and the men who are employed in producing the sugar, are all more or less interested. We should consider how this duty will affect thousands of people who are engaged in primary production, and also the case-makers, the tinsmiths, and the label printers, and scores of others who find employment in connexion with the industry. </para>

                        <para>- No ; they use slightly less, if anything. As a matter of fact the sugar used by the colonial preserver costs him l1/2d. per lb. more than the sugar used by the Swiss manufacturer. That is to say, be pays3/4d. more for the sugar used in every pound tin of milk than does the Swiss manufacturer. Therefore, the so called protection that is enjoyed by the local manufacturer is reduced by3/4d. per lb., on account of the extra cost of sugar. The Treasurer quoted from a circular to show how illegitimate competition is brought to bear on industries which we are endeavoring to build up in the States. I am in a position to complete the Treasurer's case, and prove the statements which the honorable member for Coolgardie questioned. </para>

                        <para>- From the Anglo-Swiss Company. The milk preserved by this company comes from Switzerland. Whilst the general price quoted is 18s. 6d. per case, the company vary their rates, apparently, where they have competition, and it is remarkable that in Tasmania and Western Australia they quote, not f.o.b., as in all other cases, but with cost of insurance and freight paid. In other words, they prepay the freight and insurance, and the consignee in either Tasmania or Western Australia has simply to take the article from the ship's slings, the price quoted for him being a shilling less per case than in other instances. </para>

                        <para>- I will tell the honorable member all about that presently. The company intimate further that they have ceased to supply their preparations to merchants in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. Thus, in those States where preserved milk is being produced, and the industry is struggling into existence, they do not commit themselves to quotations, but place their goods in the hands of agents who I know have instructions to put the prices down in order to keep the colonial article out. In the other two States, however, where they have no agents, they quote prices including the cost of insurance and freight, which is equal to about 3s. 9d. per case. </para>

                    <para>- I confess that I have been a little surprised to hear the various arguments adduced on the. protectionist side as to why this duty on preserved milk should be imposed. A moment ago we had the assertion that the effect of the duty would be to lower the price; but only a few minutes previously another honorable member said - "We want to raise the price of the article so as to be able to pay higher wages." When protectionist doctrines lead to such extraordinary and irreconcilable results we may well wonder whether they are founded upon the real facts of the case. We are told that because sugar enters into the manufacture of preserved milk, that is a reason why we should put an extra duty upon the article ; but when we are considering the duty on sugar we are told that a higher rate is required in order that the price of sugar may be lowered to the consumer. Let us give the protectionists a taste of their own doctrines for once. As they say that the duty lowers the price of sugar, and as condensed milk contains 50 per cent. of sugar, it is clear from this argument that the manufacturer of condensed milk will stand in a better position through that duty being imposed. If, on the other hand, the duty does not cheapen the article, and is unfair to the manufacturer of condensed milk, that is a good reason why the duty on sugar should be considerably lower, so as to do as little harm as possible to what is described as one of the great primary industries of the country. We have not vet had a single figure submitted to us from the protectionist side to show why we should insist on an extra duty on preserved milk. On the other hand, the figures adduced by the honorable member for Coolgardie showed indisputably that the duty will press hardly upon the great pioneering population of our country. In fact, the honorable member for Coolgardie might have shown, on the very figures submitted by the Treasurer himself, that there will be a diminution of imports from the imposition of this duty to something like 60 per cent. It is therefore clear that the duty cannot benefit the pioneer industries, nor can it be of any use from the revenue point of view. If honorable members opposite said that they supported the duty because there ought to be a certain amount of taxation on those engaged in the pioneer industries, I could have understood the argument, because it is necessary that a certain amount of revenue should be raised. But we have a right to object when they urge that this duty should be imposed for the benefit of the people who will have to pay it. The duty ought to be reduced by at least3/4d. per lb. At least, so far as I am concerned, if the proposal were made to make condensed milk entirely free, I should vote for it. I shall have great confidence in supporting the amendment of the honorable member for Coolgardie, and I trust that the committee will support it, in order to remove a burden from the pioneer population of this country. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of the prices in Western Australia, to which particular reference has been made : and I contend that the proposal of the Government means only 25 per cent. on the lower priced article, and, of course, less on the higher-priced. As to this industry being in the hands of a few individuals, I should say that all the producers throughout Australia are interested. There are two factories in my electorate, and the farmers there regard the promoters of these enterprises as public benefactors. The factories provide excellent markets for milk, and it is chiefly in the interests of farmers that I speak. As in most other cases, the competition of the foreign companies is not fair. They reduce prices for the express purpose of closing the local factories, and with the ultimate object of raising prices. That has been the case in connexion with every attempt to establish a local industry which in any way enters into competition with an imported commodity ; and if that were not the case I should not be so strong an advocate of protection. There are very few industries which have a larger and more hopeful future than that of the preparation of condensed milk, or, indeed, of dealing with milk in every shape and form. One of the factories in my district produces condensed milk, and the other concentrated milk, and each is an excellent article, about which I have never heard any complaint from consumers. Milk from these factories has been sent to Western Australia, and, after being kept there a considerable time, returned, and found to be in first-class condition. Considerable quantities are being exported now to South Africa, and, with reasonable protection, these factories will spread throughout the Commonwealth, seeing that they are eminently suited to our conditions. There is the one drawback, that we have to pay a higher price for sugar than is paid in Europe, but against that we have a more plentiful supply of milk; and I believe that with internal competition, which we shall have when the industry is fairly established, prices will be reduced to the lowest level. This, of course, will take a little time ; and I regard the duty as proposed by the Government as a fair compromise, as between the 2d. per lb. imposed in Victoria and Queensland, and the lower duties of the other States. It is unfortunate that the honorable member for Wentworth, who is generally so very cautious, and weighs his language, should refer to the legislation of Victoria as representing the acts of madmen. If we chose to retaliate, as we often have good grounds for doing, we could point to the policy in New South Wales of sending orders abroad and of closing down industries and depriving people of work as the best means of keeping up wages. </para>

                    <para>- I am sufficiently acquainted with the Minister for Trade and Customs to realize that after the speech we have just heard it is not much use applying to him on behalf of Western Australia for further consideration. I am still hopeful, however, that we can appeal with some little effect to the other members of the committee. The Minister for Trade and Customs evidently considers that he made a strong point when he showed us from statistics that the people of Western Australia were not to be taxed under his proposal any more than under the old condition of things. But it is rather unfortunate for the right honorable gentleman's case that if the Treasurer is not going to obtain an increased sum from this duty, the people of Western Australia will continue to pay 8d. and 8£d. instead of 6d. or 6id. for their tin of milk. When we consider the large quantity of condensed milk used in Western Australia, we begin to realize that this is a particularly unfortunate duty for the people of that State. The incidence of all taxation should be made as equitable as possible. This is a duty which undoubtedly presses unduly on a portion of the community, who, in spite of the objection of the Minister for Trade and Customs to frequent reference to the fact, is an important portion. I refer to the great primary producers throughout Australia, more especially miners and other pioneers in the interior ; and we must at once realize that this tax is hardly fair in its incidence so far as these people are concerned. Those who have argued that the foreign trader takes an unfair advantage of producers in a country such as our own, have been distinctly unfortunate in choosing this item as an illustration. The particular condensed milk which is largely consumed in Western Australia is Nestle's Anglo-Swiss milk. </para>

                        <para>- I quite realize that fact ; but this milk is sold throughout. Australia, certainly in Western Australia, absolutely on its merits. It commands the highest price in the Western Australian market, so that whatever may be contended with regard to other importations does not hold good in this case. This article has come to Western Australia practically at the same price for a number of years ; and it is the one article which can be relied on for unvarying quality and general excellence. It keeps in any part of Western Australia ; not only in the hotter parts, but also on the coast are its keeping qualities valued by the house-wife. I know from personal experience that it is the most popular article of the kind in Western Australia, and largely, I think, on account of its keeping qualities. We have had the usual reference to the sliding scale as it exists in Western Australia. When a duty is referred to by a Western Australian member, and the Minister for Trade and Customs has to reply, we may always expect that unfortunate sliding scale to be thrown in our faces. But I again say emphatically that this sliding scale is not of the making of the people of Western Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That maybe so, I do not see for a moment that the skilled labour need be such, or that the industry will employ so very many hands, as has been indicated by honorable members on the other side. If we have the necessary machinery, and a little practical experience, I am confident that we shall be able to turn out the article in sufficient quantities to supply the whole of Australia. The industry will advance as the knowledge that is gained in its practice increases. I hope the committee will seriously consider whether it is justified in placing a very heavy tax on the consumers of this article throughout Australia, more especially when the industry is one which can well exist here by reason of the natural protection it enjoys. The Swiss milk has to be conveyed from Switzerland by a long railway journey to the Straits of Dover. It has then to be conveyed on board ship and carried to London. From London it is sent -all over 'the world. Surely the shipping, railway, and other charges in connexion with the transfer of an article in the way I have indicated afford sufficient protection, in view of the natural facilities which exist in Australia for the manufacture of this article. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of what I know has been accomplished in Queensland, as the result of the protective duties imposed there in respect of these commodities. Although the Minister has said that the only company engaged in the manufacture of condensed milk, which has proved a success, is the one that he named, I may state that in my own constituency there are six or seven companies starting in the industry. There are two, I believe, manufacturing concentrated milk, while the others are making milk in a condensed form. The agent for one of these - the Trelawney Company - has just returned from America, where he went to inspect the latest machinery, and to make himself familiar with the most modern and approved processes for the manufacture of condensed milk. I look forward to the time when, at no very remote period, this industry will have assumed the proportions gained already by the butter industry, and when, instead of the brand of a foreign maker being bolstered up, as it has been here to-night, we shall be advertising our own Australian condensed milk in all parts of the world. It is admitted on all hands that Australia can produce milk on her pastures as good as that of any country, and with as little trouble. I believe that. I believe that the milk produced here is as rich as that of any other part of the world. It is a remarkable thing that this country, possessing such facilities for the grazing of cattle, should have to import the condensed milk which its people require. There should be no occasion to do so. We have to consider that those who start this industry here have to contend against large established firms, who in order to prevent a step being taken in this direction, are prepared to flood our markets with their product, and sell it at a lower price than they ask for it in their own country. They do so not because they desire to be generous to us, but because they wish to deter us from entering into competition with them and acquiring their market. If they succeeded in preventing the establishment of the industry here would they continue to keep their prices down? No. As soon as it had been shown that the industry could not be established locally their prices would go up. I hope that the duty proposed by the </para>

The industry will be affected by the price which the manufacturer has to pay for his sugar, but while I have said that I cannot follow the proposal made by the honorable member for Coolgardie, I am of opinion that the duty imposed by the Government is too high. I hope that the Government will see their way clear to make a compromise by reducing the duty to1d. per lb., because from the figures I have worked out I am prepared to believe that that duty would give some consideration to the local manufacturer, and provide the extra amount that he has to pay for his sugar. I am as anxious as any one in this Chamber to uphold our local wages ; but the reiteration of the statement that we are getting from foreign countries goods manufactured by persons receiving a low rate of wages becomes somewhat wearisome. If in the Commonwealth of Australia we are going to attempt to hold up the wages of all the rest of the world, we shall be assuming a task which, I am afraid, will be found too great for us. I cannot support the present amendment, but I shall be prepared to support an amendment fixing the duty at1d. </para>

The honorable member for Moreton seems very anxious to protect this industry, simply because he has two or three condensed milk factories in his own electorate. When the honorable member had a chance, on Friday, of giving people some protection in the shape of cheap salt, I did not notice the honorable member voting for it. The honorablememberforMerndagave the whole show away. He told us that he was going to clinch the argument of the Minister for Trade and Customs. The honorable member did . clinch it, and at the same time clinched my vote. I am going to vote for a reduction. As I have told honorable members before, I am here with a brief from the consumer, who pays me £400 a year to look after his interests, and I intend to look after them. </para>

I do not wish to put a ring round Queensland such as honorable members desire to put round Victoria. I should like to see all our ports thrown open, that we might have free "tucker" as well as free air. I have pointed out before that in my district in Queensland we have to pay not only the protective duties for the establishment of the industry, but also high railway freights, which, in many instances, amount to 100 per cent., on the price of the article. I know that the freight on kerosene amounts to over 50 per cent., on the price of that article, and everything else is in the same proportion. Some honorable members profess to be unable to understand why a labour representative should be a free-trader ; but. if they were living in my. district they would be more than free-traders. Honorable members say that they wish to help the farmer, and, if they do, I fail to see why they should make him pay more than he need pay for articles of ordinary consumption. I have not heard any argument in this Chamber which proves that protection is going to make any articles cheaper. "We had an instance to the contrary on Friday last, because when we increased the duty upon salt, the price of the article went up to 13s 6d. When the duty of 2d. was put upon condensed milk in Queensland, a number of factories started. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member said that the beet sugar used for the manufacture of condensed milk in Europe could be bought for from £8 to £9 per ton. I make the figures run out in this way - £8 per ton for the sugar; £10 per ton duty,, that being the duty on beet sugar ; 30s. per ton freight; and 10s. per ton for handling and Customs charges. That makes. £20 per ton for that sugar landed here. The price of Queensland cane sugar in Melbourne at the present time is from £21 5s. to £21 15s. per ton, and the honorable member is not going to make me believe that people here will pay £21 5s. per ton for Queensland sugar when they can get the other sugar for £20 per ton. If the European beet-sugar can be landed here cheaper, the manufacturers of condensed milk will not study Queensland for five minutes. These people do not carry on their business for the public benefit, but to make money, and I do not blame them for that. I shall support the amendment fixing the duty at3/4d., and I would vote for an amendment making it1/2d. or less, if an honorable member moved it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not surprised at honorable members representing Western Australia being somewhat concerned about this duty. I think they are to be highly commended for the temperate way in which' they have put their arguments, but I think their fears are groundless. This is a commodity which is very largely used in their State, and they are afraid that their constituents will have to pay dearly for it. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that in this country, which has obtained such a reputation as a butter-producing country, there should be any alarm when we talk of applying to preserved milk the same policy which has been applied to the production of butter with so much success. The honorable member for Moreton mentioned the fact that the production of hams, bacon, cheese, and butter has been encouraged by duties and bounties, and that these articles can now be obtained very much cheaper than before. </para>

                        <para>- Very largely in consequence of the duties. I find that we import into the Commonwealth now nearly 9,500,000 lbs. of preserved milk, to the value of nearly£250,000. Surely if there is one thing in connexion with which we may help the primary producer it is this article of condensed milk ? We are making now in the Commonwealth 102,000,000. lbs weight of butter per annum, and surely we can make 9,000,000 or 10,000,000 lbs. weight of preserved milk without dislocating any industry, and without increasing the price to the consumer? The honorable and learned member for Werriwa said it was not shown that this would benefit any industry. The acting leader of the Opposition, who I am sorry to see, is not in a better frame of mind, scoffed at this as a small pettifoggingindustry. The honorable gentleman looked only at the factories concerned, but the factory deals only with the last process in connexion with condensed milk. Taking the importation at the present time at 9,500,000 lbs. weight, the tins required for that quantity would at 1d. per tin amount to £40,000, spent here. </para>

                        <para>- Taking the price at only 1/2d. per tin, the amount would be £20,000. Then we should want 25,000 or 30,000 cases to put them in, and we should also want labels. To produce that quantity of milk, I estimate roughly that we should require from 100,000 to 150,000 cows, and allowing 50 cows for each farmer, which would be a large number for each, it would mean that from 2,000 to 3,000 farmers would be employed in producing this commodity. </para>

                        <para>- I know that, but we could make the condensed milk in addition to the butter, and we should find work for tinsmiths, carpenters, and farmers. The honorable members for Western Australia often refer to the primary producers, and we know that in their State great efforts are being made, and special inducements are being offered to induce farmers to take up land, and enter upon the various agricultural industries. Yet, here honorable members are taking action which will take away from the people they are endeavouring to put upon the land one of the main sources of profit. . This is not a new duty. Queensland has had a duty of 2d. per lb. for 12 years, and . Western Australia a duty of 15 per cent. I look at the question mainly from the. farmers' point of view. I hold that the im - position of the duty will beneficially affect a number of other traders and will be the means of providing a very large amount of employment. I am sorry that the Govern- . ment did not see their way to propose a duty of 2d. per lb., and if I thought that there was the least chance of getting the duty raised to that amount I should move in that direction. Under the circumstances I will accept a duty of l1/2dper1b. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with some honorable members that we ought to offer a reasonable measure of encouragement to an industry of this character, but we have to pay some regard to the fact that the consumers of the article are mostly those who are rendering a very large service to the, cause of civilization and settlement in Australia. I allude to the men who are bringing into productive use thousands of square miles of land which' otherwise would remain a waste. These men have to undergo hardships and discomforts which are altogether unknown to the residents of the more temperate coastal districts. While I desire, as far as possible, to encourage local industry, I would temper the wind to the shorn lamb in the vast wastes of Australia. It seems to me that a duty of1d. per lb. would be a reasonable impost from the point of view of the two parties. It must be admitted that it would not be fair to admit the article free of duty, so that the local producer would have to pay a duty on his sugar, while the importer would be free of that charge. </para>

                        <para>- We have not yet decided to impose a duty of £10 a ton on beet sugar. I understand that in Germany the bounty amounts to about 30s. a ton, yet the Government have placed an increased duty of £4 a ton on beet sugar as compared with the duty on cane sugar. It is a question whether - allowing that we keep to the tenor of the bargain with respect to the sugar duties and the kanaka labour problem - we should make such a large distinction as to duty between cane sugar and beet sugar. We have to consider the rate at which the Swiss or Dutch producer of condensed milk gets his sugar, and the disadvantages in the way of freight and other conditions with which he has to contend in getting his product to market. The amount of sugar duty in a pound of preserved milk, ' taking the duty at £6 a ton, comes to3/8 of a' penny. That would leave a protection of 5/8 of a penny if the duty were fixed at1d. per lb. If, of course, we take the sugar at £9 per ton-- </para>

                        <para>- But that has not come on to the market yet. The price runs between £10 and £11, which leaves a difference of £10 a ton between the price there and the price paid for Australian cane sugar. If we admit beet sugar at something nearer an approximation to the rate charged for cane-sugar, then the distinction will not be so great as the honorable member for Mernda assumes. But, against the lower price of sugar in the older land, there has undoubtedly to be placed the freight, insurance, and other charges incidental to its transport from the continent to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The probability is that the preserved milk will be exported to Western Australia not so much from Queensland as from Victoria. It must be admitted that Victoria possesses advantages in that regard that Queensland does not possess, and probably Queensland would find that her better market would be the old land, to which the exporters could get a direct freight proportionately much cheaper than they could to Western Australia. I cannot go quite so far as the honorable member for Coolgardie proposes to go, because a duty of3/4d. per lb. would leave hardly any margin, considering the extra impost on the sugar, to the Australian producer. But I think that a duty of1d., allowing for all the extra charges such as the honorable member for Mernda spoke of, would leave him at least a half-penny per lb., and an industry which cannot subsist, even under new conditions, with a protection to that extent has not my sympathy. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has not stated what proportion of labour is employed in this industry. He has withheld that information. So far as the preserving is concerned my information leads me to think that the amount of labour required is a small item compared with the machinery, which is common to Victoria or New South Wales, and Switzerland. Of course, the labour engaged in the milking operations has nothing to do with the factories which produce the condensed milk. I doubt very much whether a greater amount is paid in this country than in the old world for labour employed in dairying generally. Taking into consideration the hours which the men work, it is not a princely sum. One of the big troubles I see ahead, so far as dairying is concerned, is whether, in the absence of machinery to effect the milking, we can raise a population who will have more intelligence than the cows they milk. Unfortunately, the children, often rising at 4 or 4.30 in the morning to bring in the cows, helping in the milking, and working away until breakfast time, are then expected to assimilate the information which the school-teacher tries to pour into them. I have seen children so soundly asleep at 4 o'clock in the afternoon that it was impossible to wake them up by any ordinary means. Although I do not urge that fact as any reason why we should not encourage the dairying industry, still it goes to prove that the conditions surrounding the industry do not differ to such a large extent as is imagined from those obtaining in the older lands. It furnishes a reason why we should not lay too much stress on the argument as to wages and conditions affecting the milking business. I think that if we reject the present amendment, and fix the duty at1d. per lb., we shall have dealt fairly between the producers and the consumers. . </para>

I find by reference to Coghlan that the total number of persons employed throughout the Commonwealth in the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industries is only 3,000, and probably not more than 150 to 200 of these would be engaged in making condensed milk. We have been asked by some honorable members why our people should not produce condensed milk as well as butter, but if those now engaged in butter making are to turn their attention to condensed milk they must give up butter making. </para>

                        <para>- I am not to be drawn off the track by the Minister for Defence. This item of preserved milk is one that affects the interests of the whole population of the Commonwealth. It particularly affects the working classes, who have to bear hardship, and receive very small wages, and from whose labour other people derive their wealth and position. For these reasons I hope that a reduction will be made on this item. </para>

                    <para>- The duty on preserved milk is one which will press very heavily upon those who are engaged in the primary industries, particularly upon those who are occupied in the most difficult of those industries, namely, the pioneers of the different States. When both fresh and preserved milk can be obtained, there is no possibility of preserved milk holding its own. Consequently, this duty does not seriously affect the large centres of population, and the settled districts where agriculture and farming are carried on. But it affects the way-back parts of the continent, where the conditions of life are the very worst, and where men are engaged in discovering and developing the mineral wealth of the country, or in making the land accessible for purposes of grazing and farming. What do we give these men in compensation for the duty we propose to levy on what they consume? Absolutely nothing, though we are loading them up with taxation. There are 1,200,000 people in the more densely settled part of the Commonwealth, included within the State of Victoria, who will contribute less than will 200,000 people in the West Australian pioneering districts of the Commonwealth, where the conditions are much more severe. From this duty the Minister estimates to raise in Victoria only £2,812 from a population of 1,200,000, whereas he hopes to raise in Western Australia £6,250 from a population of 200,000, or an excess of nearly £3,500 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- In New South Wales the Ministry estimate to raise by this tax £12,500, and in Queensland £4,600 ; and these are the States in which, while there is fairly well-established settlement, with the accompanying conditions of civilization, there are large areas where pioneering work is being done. It is at places like Broken Hill and Wilcannia where preserved milk enters largely into consumption ; and this bears out the contention from this side of the House that the proposed duty will fall on people who are least able to bear it, and who are doing the greatest service by developing the latent resources of the Commonwealth. Another contention is that this is a primary industry in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, if not in the whole of the States ; but if it is a primary industry in the proper sense of the word, it does not. require the encouragement proposed. The conditions are such as should make towards, placing this industry on a self-supporting basis, and do not justify this dipping into the pockets of the " way-back " man. My in7 formation .leads me to suppose that there is something more in this question than the mere suitability or otherwise of a large portion of the States for dairying purposes. In the State of New South Wales considerable* attention has been given to this matter, and it has been considered that if butter,, cheese-making, and similar pursuits could be added to by the preserved milk industry, a. greater outlet would be afforded for the milk supplied, and better prices would result. It would appear from the circular which has been addressed to me by the manager of the Anglo-Australian Milk Preserving Company that Victoria is far and* away ahead of the other States in this industry ; and it came as a surprise to me to hear the Minister of Customs state that New South Wales occupies the premier position. Whatever advantage New South Wales has. obtained is due to a large dairying industry, and to the fact that a number of those engaged are enterprising, and desirous of: striking out on new lines in the way of providing additional food supply for the people of  Australia. The great trouble seems to be that they are not able to place on the market of Australia an article that in all respects can hold its own with imported milk. One manufacturer, who has invested-, a large sum of money in this industry in a part of New South Wales, where there is every indication of success, admits that, the great trouble is that he cannot provide an article which, under our trying climatic conditions, can compete with the European milk. With a. view to getting the latest information on the matter, and to enable him to compete with the Swiss and other foreign milks, he visited the factories in England, and .also« the celebrated Swiss milk works; and he came back impressed with the fact that there is some expert knowledge which is not possessed by manufacturers, in Australia. In his desire to unlock the secret, he offered large salaries to experts in the factories he visited, but he could not induce them to come to Australia, and he had to remain satisfied with the: knowledge that there was a trade secret.. </para>

                        <para>- All I can do is to express regret that the Minister should have so spoken as to give anybody that impression, for which, I admit, there was not much foundation. . But I was very sorry to hear the way in which the Minister spoke about the pioneers. He drew a pathetic picture of a pioneer who sat upon a hollow log lamenting that he had no milk to put in his tea. That may be humorous from the point of view of the right honorable gentleman, but if he were sitting on a hollow log in the back-blocks, and had no milk for his tea, he would fail to see the humour of the situation. Surely the Minister for Trade and Customs could have found some subject for his jest other than these poor men, who, I can honestly say, will suffer very severely indeed as the result of this Tariff. The right honorable gentleman also said he was. getting heartily sick of Western Australian members speaking as if there were no pioneers throughout the Commonwealth except in  their own State. I am sorry if that, impression has been created, but I can go so far as to say that the amount of pioneering work done in Western Australia during; the last, six or seven years has- been considerably greater than that done in all the rest of Australia. It is not a district, but. virtually an auriferous continent that has. been opened up by the pioneers referred toby the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Surely there is a difference in the freight between these places ? The honorable member only spoke of the two extremes. He also said the local manufacturers had to pay £21 per ton for sugar, while bounty-fed sugar could be obtained, where this article was produced on the continent, at £8 5s. per ton. Some honorable member interjected - " What about cane sugar?" and the honorable member said that cane sugar was on a parity with beet sugar. If cane sugar can be obtained for £8 5s. per ton in Europe, then it can be landed here at a total cost of £15 10s. or £16 per ton, and if the honorable member meant to suggest that people here are so foolish as to pay £21 per ton, when they can land cane sugar from Europe here at that price- - </para>

It is essential in matters of this kind that members should be free from suspicion, and the proper course is that adopted by one honorable member in not voting or even speaking unless upon a reduction of a duty. </para>

I find that there are not more than 130 men engaged in this industry throughout Australia, and of that number some 67 are engaged in New South Wales, where there is no duty whatever. That leaves only about 60 men in the rest of Australia who can by any means be said to be benefited by a protective duty on this article. There are over 100,000 miners in Australia, but there is no benefit proposed to be given to them. </para>

                    <para>- It astonishes me that there should be any difference of opinion upon the proposed reduction of the duty upon this article to3/4d., when, I suppose, our natural opportunities for producing milk are greater than those of any other part of the world. In Queensland, after a wet season, there are hundreds of thousands of tons of fodder could be stored for the dry seasons. It requires no special effort to secure this vast amount of herbage which goes to waste annually. Hundreds of thousands of tons could be mowed with mowing machines, stacked and made ready for use in a season when fodder was too scarce. With such enormous opportunities at our command, it is ridiculous to think that we want a protective duty to encourage the development of this industry. A large proportion of the preserved milk which is used in Queensland is imported, and the bulk of it is sent into the far western districts, as well as the various mining centres. Until I came to Melbourne I did not know that milk was preserved in Australia. During the many years I have lived in Queensland I have never seen a tin of preserved milk which had not been imported. It should be our aim to make the burden of the pioneers as light as possible. Considering the hardships which they have to undergo, we should be willing to afford them an opportunity to get this luxury as cheaply as possible. Five thousand or 6,000 men are employed at Charters Towers, 1,000 or 1,500 men at Croydon, and thousands on the gold-fields extending right out between Charters Towers and Croydon for a distance of700 miles, and away round in the </para>

                    <para>- With regard to this matter of soap, we are apparently following a somewhat different course than that adopted in respect of a number of other articles. Fancy soaps are made in. Australia to a considerable extent. They are made in Sydney by Lever Bros and by the Manchester Co-operative Society. At the present time there are in the States varying duties, probably proposed with the object of getting some reasonable amount of revenue from this article. In Victoria and South Australia the duty is 4d. per lb., in Queensland and Tasmania 3d., and in Western Australia 20 per cent. The duty here proposed amounts to between 20 and 25 per cent., and I do not think that is too high a rate upon an article which is made here, and which is also imported to a large extent. Fancy soaps in the year 1898 were imported to the extent of 985,000 lbs., and in 1899 to the extent of 812,000 lbs. We have calculated the importation at about 490,000 lbs. or 500,000 lbs. at the proposed rate. I think we should keep the duty of 4d. upon perfumed or fancy soaps, but I am prepared to compromise upon ordinary household soaps to the extent of reducing the duty from1d. to1/2d. In spite of what we hear, the Government want all the revenue they can get. If we allow this duty to remain at 4d. there will probably be just as much imported as there would be if we reduced it to 3d. </para>

                            <para>- I object also to any one in the position of acting leader of the Opposition stating that the party is in favour of these duties. As a party we are not in favour of them. I object to this Tariff as a whole, and therefore I object to try to improve it. I accept the reduction of1/2d. per lb. only because I see it would be useless to move that it be placed on the free list. By placing such a high duty on superior soap the committee are in effect saying that a common soap is good enough for the common people. It is a fitting proposal to come from a body of tories like the Ministry. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that, from a financial point of view, we should know what is the mind of the committee in regard to items which in many instances are more of a revenue than of a protective character, as it may affect what may be done hereafter. There are some items, such as mining machinery, in regard to which there is a general desire that they should be placed on the free list, or that the duty proposed by the Government should be reduced. If we keep what are absolutely revenue producing items hung up, I do not see how we are going to deal with the other items. I should like the Minister for Trade and Customs to give us some definite reasons for the postponement of these three items. I think it is only fair to the committee that when any items are postponed which naturally belong to a certain division, that has been drawn up by the Government themselves, we ought to be told the reason for the postponement. </para>

                            <para>- That is the intimation we gave, and no exception was taken to it. The reason is, amongst others, that our attitude in connexion with these matters may be influenced to a considerable extent by the revenue which they produce. Day by day there is further opportunity being given for forming a correct estimate as to the revenue results of the Tariff. I am not going to discuss what these are at present, though I may say at once, that they are not at all of the character suggested by one branch of the daily press to-day. By the time we have disposed of these three divisions, 5, 6 and 6a, we shall be in a position to deal with the items which have been referred to. We shall have further information which will aid the committee in coming to wise and deliberate conclusions as to what should be done in regard to these matters. That is the reason for the postponement. </para>

I have allowed the usual privilege to the acting leader of the Opposition to depart from the rules of debate in order to make a statement with a view to eliciting information. The Minister has replied, and as the items alluded to have been postponed with the sanction of the committee they cannot be debated until they are moved again in the order in which the Minister may propose them. The item now before the committee is " Apparel." </para>

Am I to understand that the ruling of the Chairman is that when the Minister proposes to postpone certain items, and the committee agree, the effect is that the Minister may take these items up at any part of the Tariff he likes, and that the postponement is not a postponement to a definite time? I do not think there was any definite motion to postpone these items until after division 6a. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister for Trade and Customs did not suggest that the items; alluded to should be postponed to the latter end of the Tariff, and if he has failed to make his meaning perfectly clear, and there is any doubt in the minds of the committee it should be quite competent for honorable members to insist that these items should be brought on for consideration again. The same course was adopted with respect to tinned fish, preserved milk, and soap, and if the strict rule were observed, those three items ought not to have been dealt with until the end of the Tariff. The committee thought that these items would be brought on at the end of division number 4. It is quite possible that if the Minister made the request for the postponing of these items in the way suggested, it would be assented to, but until the right honorable gentleman gets the assent of the committee, he is not justified in postponing them. </para>

Suppose it was the feeling of the committee that a mistake had been made in postponing these items, would it be competent for any member to move that the items be taken into consideration, and the rest of the schedule postponed until after they have been considered? I, of course, accept the statement of the Chairman, because with his officers he knows what went on, but I must say that had I known there was any attempt to postpone these items in the way proposed, I should have made a very strong protest against it, and I should perhaps have taken further measures. I should like to know if these items are absolutely beyond the control of the committee at this stage ? </para>

                            <para>- I presume that I shall better please the committee at all times by conforming to what is clearly the wish of the majority, or is in accordance with the unanimous feeling of the committee. The honorable member for Bland has referred to what is undoubtedly the procedure, and if I am asked strictly to rule in accordance with procedure, I shall consider the schedule of the Tariff as a Bill. Honorable members are aware that when a Bill is before the committee, if clauses are postponed, they are not considered until after the remaining clauses of the Bill have been dealt with. The Minister, in dealing with this matter, intimated that he would take these items later on. I received no intimation that he desired them to be taken at the end of the schedule, but later on, when he was prepared to submit them to the committee. He has taken that course in regard to one or two postponed items, but he has not chosen to take that course in regard to others. I trust that honorable members desiring the business to be carried on will not ask me to rule strictly in the matter, but if I am asked so to rule, I must decide that these postponed items can not be considered until the whole of the rest of schedule is dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to know how Ministers are going to deal with this division. We are beginning the consideration of a division now which is of very great importance, and it is one in which the decision upon one item may depend upon the decision with respect to another item. I wish to point out to my right honorable friend that, in my opinion, the order in which these items are put down is not the natural order. In the first place, we have " apparel," but that is the final stage of the manufacture, so to speak. </para>

                            <para>- Naturally, in this case the raw material should come first. In the case of woollens, wool is the raw material of woollen piece goods, and woollen piece goods are the raw material made up clothes. We are not dealing now with the original raw material of either cotton or woollen goods, but we are dealing with piece goods,' and manufactured clothing, and honorable members will allow that there is some kind of scientific proportion between the raw material and the manufactured article. In other words, if we are willing, as we are, to recognise the principle of revenue without destruction, and if we are not going to propose to put any of these items on the free list, but to materially reduce the rates, then it would be better for us to start work on the raw material items, and the piece goods, unless, as the division is so very important, being practically the beginning of our dealing with the manufacturing industries, we have a general debate for the remainder of the evening. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to enter into that subject, but if the wages of the whole of the operatives in New South Wales are taken together they will be found to be quite equal to those paid in Victoria. I am not a friend of low wages, and I have always done everything I could personally to increase the pay of the wage earner. I could prove that if I desired to go into personal matters. So far as silks and velvets are concerned I do not care very much what duty is imposed on them. If they are to be looked upon as luxuries the committee can decide what duty should be imposed on them. I am dealing with the necessaries of life, with those articles that enter into the clothing and food of the great masses of the people of Australia, and I consider that in fighting for our principles in connexion with these articles, my colleagues and I are the true democrats of Australia. We represent the democracy against monopoly. The Government and those who support them by piling up these duties are creating a system of manufactures with vested interests which the very democracy that is crying out for them will be the first to denounce. Coming to the question of the made-up article I quite agree with the principle of revenue without destruction, and believe that we must have some kind of reasonable proportion between the raw material and the manufactured article. </para>

                            <para>- I do not care what duties are imposed upon them. I always believed in a moderate duty, even for revenue purposes. I advocate the fixing of a duty which will not have the effect of reducing imports. If an excess of duty is imposed, imports will decrease, and the revenue must suffer, but the point at which the duty should be fixed is more a matter of experience than anything else. Now I come to the great article of apparel, and here again I would differentiate between garments made up in cotton and those made up in wool and silk. In this particular section - as in all sections, but especially in this one - even at the expense of charging a duty on certain things that might be exempt, I would simplify matters as much as possible. For instance, the Government have mixed up a number of articles, such as coatings, vests, flannels, and flannelettes. Flannels are sometimes made of mixed materials, and sometimes wholly of wool, but flannelettes are made of cotton. </para>

                            <para>- I do mind that, because I think it a very important matter. The more we complicate these things, the more opportunities we give for fraud and for inflicting injustice on the honest importer. I draw a clean line between cotton piece goods and woollen piece goods. I would not mix up the various articles in the ridiculous way in which they are grouped in the Tariff. When we come to the question of apparel, I do not know that I am inclined to absolutely fix the duty, but I would favour as a maximum 15 per cent. on the ordinary made-up article. Certainly I would not favour1/4d. more, and possibly less, for the cotton made-up article. </para>

                            <para>- I have not yet concluded. I had no intention of reflecting in any way upon the honesty and integrity "of the honorable member for Wentworth. The only desire I had was to elicit certain information, which I believed I was entitled to, regarding the honorable member's attitude in connexion with the action which was taken by one of his own supporters. The honorable member says that he intends to take a certain course, and has given us his reasons. I accept fully and unreservedly the statement he has made with regard to his own attitude as to these duties. I am glad to find that of all the importers with whom I am acquainted, he is the only one who is of opinion that a free port would not be the best tiling for him. </para>

                            <para>- I am talking of any industry ; boots for instance. Two-thirds of the boots sold in New South Wales are made in that State. I do not say that protection will not force industry, or that industries will not be established sooner because of protection. Anybody knows that a duty may be imposed which will be absolutely prohibitive; but it is reasonable - and I say this because I do not want to have the charge of provincialism hurled at me - in looking at this division of the Tariff to consider what are the conditions in New South Wales. We are all Britishers, though Victoria enjoys a better climate, which gives . more energy than the climate of New South Wales. I say most distinctly that with the exception of the hat manufacture, there is not a single article in this division, so far as I know, on which we cannot get object lessons from New South Wales. We are not asking that there shall be a free port in Victoria ; we are not asking that the duties shall be done away with. We are simply asking for a moderate compromise ; and surely that is not an unreasonable request. I trust that we shall not be met by the hide-bound answer which has been given to us by many. There are honorable members on the other side who seem to have their minds so hidebound that no logic or argument can move them. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not, because we have offered to compromise. Here we have a duty of 25 per cent, proposed, and we are not hide-bound when we suggest that 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, is quite enough. The fact is that New South Wales is giving everything and getting nothing. I reiterate that it is not as if we had not absolutely proved our case by the results of our own industries. I honestly believe that the great, bulk of the Victorian people have no idea of the extent of our industries ; that they do not know to what extent these industries have increased during the last few years. In any shop in Sydney will be found a hive of colonial industry. Buy a portmanteau, and it will have been made in the State. </para>

                            <para>- Rubbish ! Does the honorable member call Newtown, Victoria? Does he call three miles from Sydney, Victoria ? I am connected with a factory myself which has been established lately without any protection at all ; but I only mention that incidentally. In the furniture business, nearly all the work is clone in Sydney, and two-thirds of the boots sold in New South Wales are made in that State. And so it is with almost every other industry, including carriage building, harness making, and nearly every industry which can be found in Victoria. No doubt there are but few of what we might call exotic industries in New South Wales. To put on a large duty, with the consequent increased prices, is simply giving a certain bonus to ' a handful of men, against the interests of the whole of the country. That is all I intend to say. I shall do everything to facilitate debate, and I think it will be better for the Government to allow this evening for the general discussion, so that we may have time to think over the definite proposals we intend to make. I assure the Government that though we shall make our fight, there will be no obstruction. We shall try to appeal to a sense of fair play, honour, and justice on behalf of the people of New South Wales, who entered into a compact of compromise, which, I trust, will be carried out. </para>

                            <para>- But they had to pay the higher rate of 25 per cent. owing to the interpretation placed on the Tariff by the Customs officer. It is pointed out also that under-pants of the commonest lines were charged at the same rate of 25 per cent. because they were soft and had the appearance of containing wool and silk. What my correspondents advocate is, that for hosiery there should be a fixed duty of 15 per cent., so that there may not be varying interpretations of the Tariff ; and that suggestion is worthy of the Treasurer's consideration. We ought to deal with the raw materials first, and then we should be able with much better effect to deal with the manufactured articles. I do not think the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will disagree with that opinion. </para>

                            <para>- But the honorable member would like a decrease on the material which white workers use. He desires a decrease on lines which affect those interested in the making up of bags, and there are other lines on which he requires decreases as well as increases. We shall be in a better position to judge of the amount of protection that should be granted when we know exactly what we are going to do with the raw material. If we deal now with the manufactured articles and increase the duties on them, we shall have to consider the question of decreases subsequently. Because of the high duties fixed on the manufactured article, I do not want to be forced to give a higher line of protection than I am inclined to give, or to penalize thousands of people who will receive no benefit from the keeping of the duty on raw material. Small and poor though South Australia is, she allowed a large number of articles to be placed on the free list. </para>

' The highest of these ought not to be more than 20 per cent., and the lowest upon those which go into every day use among the poorer people should not be more than 5 per cent., if it is impossible to place them on the free list. I hope that we shall deal with the raw materials first, and then we shall know exactly what we have to do in future. </para>

                        <para>- There is the industry with which we are. dealing - that relating to apparel. Take the question of the imports of apparel and slops made from woollens, on which, in 1892, there was a duty of 50 per cent, under the Victorian Tariff. I find that in that year we imported no less than £344,000 worth of goods in that particular line, so that at no time have we had a prohibitive duty in connexion with that line. Take hats and caps. With a duty of 36s. per dozen we imported into Victoria £39,000 worth of these goods, and yet we are told that the Government proposal is prohibitive, and that a monopoly has been created. I should like honorable members to tell me of one industry in Victoria in connexion with which a monopoly has been established. There is no monopoly in hats and caps. </para>

If we would only reduce the duty and place it in the same position as that which obtained in New South Wales, he would not manufacture one pair of boots from to-morrow. For the last twenty years he has been foremost in opposing every increase of duties in every respect. He will tell honorable members plainly, as a number of other manufacturers will tell them, that if he could only get rid of these duties, and import his goods, wages boards and industrial troubles would be at an end for him. </para>

We have never had a prohibitive duty in Victoria. When our duties have been at their highest we have imported enormous quantities of goods. My honorable friends of the Opposition are determined to fight in order to largely reduce the duties. I have not a single farthing's interests in any one of these industries, but because I believe they are in the interests of our industrial life and in the interest of the wage-earners, I am going to fight hard to maintain the Government proposals, and to increase them in many instances. </para>

                            <para>- What I propose is that we shall take the amendment upon these items first, because by the division on these items a large proportion of the preceding items may be affected . We cannot possibly do justice to any item containing cotton referred to in the preceding numbers, if the committee later on agree to a reduction of the duty or the omission of the duty on the two items which I have mentioned. The acting leader of the Opposition is entirely in accord with my suggestion, and I ask the Government if they will agree to this arrangement, which, it seems to me, will greatly facilitate discussion. It can only result in a thorough discussion of the matter on its merits, while on the other hand, if we take each item singly, starting with item 57, without knowing what will happen when we come to deal with the piece goods, out of which many of the articles referred to in the preceding items are made, we shall not be able to do justice to them. There is, for instance, the item "meat wraps." They are included in the special exemptions, and they are made in my own electorate. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable member for West Sydney that it will be better to take the piece goods before we take the made-up articles, so that in coming to a decision as to the rate we shall impose upon made-up goods, we shall be able to take into consideration the amount of duty we have already decided to impose upon the piece goods, from which those articles are made. I think that course would result in greater progress being made than if we were to have a discussion upon apparel and articles of attire not elsewhere included, while we were absolutely in the dark as to the rate we were going to place upon the piece goods. Another matter to which I wish to direct attention is that the second paragraph of item 57 involves a 25 per cent. duty upon cotton hosiery, which is not made here and which it would be very expensive to make here. </para>

                            <para>- I was given to understand that cotton hosiery was not made locally, but if I am assured that it is, the objection I have taken will not apply, though it might be admitted at a lower duty than 25 per cent. I do not wish to delay the committee by a general discussion, but I think some of the items in Division 5 will stand reduction without any great harm to any one. I think it is reasonable to suggest that a smaller duty than 20 per cent, on general tweed goods would be sufficient, and I trust that the' item " cotton piece goods " will be omitted from the schedule altogether. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to take advantage of the Minister's suggestion that there should be an all-round debate on this division now. An all-round debate will not save much time, because the arguments used will have to be repeated again when reductions or increases on the different items are proposed. I am glad that the Minister has to some extent made a clearer definition under this heading. I understand that he intends to have but one duty for all " cotton and linen piece goods." </para>

I have here a book of decisions of the Victorian Customs, containing some 600 decisions on the late Victorian Tariff. I claim that the Tariff "ought to define matters with sufficient clearness to obviate the necessity for these after definitions. The action taken by Ministers in connexion with cottons and linens will avoid a great deal of difficulty, indefiniteness, and necessity for decisions, and if it can be done they should bring -other items of textile manufactures into line, so that there shall be no necessity to find out whether an article contains this or that, or is a substitute for this or that. I desire to point out how peculiar were the arguments used by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports in support of his statement that he is going to endeavour to increase the duties. </para>

The honorable member for Melbourne Ports said that one woollen mill if  Victoria put out as much as all the woollen mills in New South Wales together. I .doubt it, but assuming it to be a correct statement, is it not evident that these smaller woollen mills in New South Wales, having been able to get along without any protection at all, the much larger mills in Victoria with a larger plant, and. less loading on the goods put out, ought to be able to do infinitely better ? </para>

                            <para>- That may be, but they are all now coming into the one fold, and surely it must be evident that if the smaller mills of New South Wales, producing a limited quantity of stuff, can pay 10 per cent, dividends without a duty, the bigger mills pf Victoria ought to be able to do the same. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports talked about being ready to impose duties to the exclusion of the imported article upon anything we can produce in the Commonwealth. If that means anything, it means that the honorable member would exclude every article that comes to our ports. The honorable member fails to recognise that circumstances have altered, and we are now a Commonwealth extending from 10 deg. south latitude to the south of Tasmania. We have every variety of climate and soil, and can produce almost every product that the world produces, and from these products we can manufacture almost every article that the world manufactures, if we give even the protection given to existing industries by the Tariff before us. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable mem bes is now going back upon his own statement. If what I have referred to is the honorable member's policy we should shut up all our ports and let British ships disappear from them. The fact is his fight is not for that purpose, but for industries which have had protection for years, and ought now to be able to get along with lesser duties than 20 and 25 per cent. I agree with the proposal of the honorable member for "Wentworth, and the honorable member for West Sydney, that piece goods ought to be taken first. There are certain members who are willing, to make reductions upon the duties on goods' used by the working classes, so long as they are revenue duties. But there is stronger" reason to make a reduction which would be an advantage to the poorer classes and the working classes on duties where the money admittedly will not go into the Treasury. Under these proposals you give the power of taxation to the manufacturer, and these duties affect the poorer classes and the working classes in the same degree as do the other revenue duties. There is quite as much reason for a reduction here as' in the case of merely revenue duties, and if there is a larger importation through that reduction, the taxation which is paid by poor or rich on the imported article goes into the Treasury. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose that honorable members who take opposite views on the fiscal question will ever convince each other as to the real reason why protectionists do see a difference between the incidence of protective and revenue duties. We may be entirely wrong ; we certainly have failed to convince the honorable member for North Sydney that we are right when we say that protective duties do not necessarily, and, as a matter of fact, do not usually, increase prices where there is a reasonable amount of competition, whereas revenue duties must inevitably do so, because there is not sufficient local competition to throw the duties back on to the foreign manufacturer. What I wish to refer to chiefly is the suggestion that we first take the duties on raw materials in this division, and work on from them to the manufactured articles. I have the greatest reluctance to voting for any duty on cotton or linen piece goods. </para>

So far as one can see at present the cotton and the linen piece goods for the Commonwealth will not be made up 'in Queensland for many a decode to come. The quantity used is so large compared with the possible production in that State for a very long time to come, that to all intents and purposes the duty will be a purely revenue one. </para>

                            <para>- I might perhaps do that, because it very often meets the difficulty in such cases. It is only revenue considerations which would induce me to vote for these duties, and if the Treasurer can see his way to do without the whole of the money, I shall very cheerfully follow him in that direction. I am certainly pleased to know that we are going to reduce the duty to 10 percent. all round. I should have supported such a reduction in any case, but I would not pledge myself to support a greater reduction of the duty on these lines. What I fear is that if the duty on cotton and linen piece goods be reduced to 5 per cent., some honorable members will make that the ground of an argument for materially reducing the duties on apparel. . Apparel is one of those articles on which a pretty high duty is more defensible than it is in many cases; it is especially defensible there, because we all know the conditions under which it is made. I do not think that a duty of 25 per cent., is too much. We had a duty of 35 per cent., in Victoria before the Federal Tariff was introduced, and previously a duty of 45 per cent. When we recollect the special conditions under which these goods are made up in other countries, it will be seen that it is urgently necessary that we should give a satisfactory measure of protection to women workers in these lines. This is one of those instances in which a case for a protective duty can be made out, even to the satisfaction of freetraders - because I believe that honorable members opposite are prepared to concede some fair measure of protection to the people who are engaged in making up these articles. But I fear that if the duties on raw material be substantially reduced, that will be made a lever for largely reducing the duties on the manufactured articles. It is just as easy to work from the manufactured article downwards, as from the raw material up. To fix your minimum and work up to your maximum is no more easy than to fix your maximum and work down to your minimum. I do not sec any logical difficulty in working either way. I wish to guard myself against being challenged with being logically compelled to vote for a reduction of duties, which I think absolutely essential for the decency of life of the workers in the manufactories, because I have voted for a reduction of the duties on the raw material. Having made my position on that point clear, if the Ministry are prepared to yield to the suggestion made, I shall be quite satisfied, but I wish it to be understood that I think that an overwhelming case can be made out for imposing a substantial protective duty without any injury to the user of the apparel, and without any increase of the price to him. </para>
