                    <para>I have to announce to the House that yesterday I forwarded the following telegram to His Excellency the Governor-General, for transmission to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with the request that His Majesty the King would cause it to be communicated to the Government of the United States : - </para>

                    <para>I wish to express the concurrence of the Government, and, I hope, of honorable members, in the course which you, sir, have taken. As tho attack upon President McKinley was made known to us last Saturday, and the House meets for the first time since then to-day, it would not have been proper to allow so long an interval to elapse without some expression of the sympathy of this Parliament with the great Republic of the United States in the terrible attack which has been made upon a man who has always been distinguished for his sympathy with popular rights and the aspirations of his own great nation. 1 think the House will relieve me from the necessity of putting myself in order by concluding with a motion ; but I may add that I hope that, long before any possible prorogation, we shall be able to express by resolution our congratulations to the President of the United States upon his complete recovery. </para>

If he has to complain of breaches of discipline in the communication of matters to outside sources - whether to the press or to members of this House - it is his duty to refrain from a similar breach in trying to bring about any reform that he may think desirable. It is his duty primarily to deal with his official superiors, including his Minister, before he resorts to interviews with the press. </para>

                        <para>- I would like to ask the Prime Minister a question with reference to the return relating to exempt kanakas in' Queensland, which on 14th June was ordered to be laid on the table. I may be wrong, but I thought that a couple of days would allow ample time for furnishing the return, and yet up to the present we have seen nothing of it. I would like to know when it will be laid on the table, because I understand that we shall soon be called upon to deal with the Pacific Islanders Bill, and it was with the object of gaining information relating to the subject of that measure that I moved in the matter. </para>

                    <para>- Since this Bill was under consideration last week, a meeting of some 50 or 60 vignerons of Victoria and other States has been held. They sat for some four hours, and agreed to a schedule of amendments which they desired to have made in the Bill. A deputation waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs, and he promised to give consideration to these amendments, and I understood that the Minister was to have prepared amendments that, to a large extent, would meet the views of the vignerons. We have not yet seen these proposals, and know nothing whatever about them, and I think it is scarcely the correct thing that we should be asked to consider these matters, which are of such great importance to so many people, without knowing beforehand what we are called upon to deal with. I do not wish to delay the business, but I think the consideration of the Bill might be very well postponed for at least an hour or two, so as to give us an opportunity of seeing what amendments the Minister has framed. </para>

                    <para>- I join with the honorable member for Echuca in requesting that the Bill may be postponed until we have an opportunity of seeing the amendments which have been prepared by the Minister of Trade and Customs. The Minister promised that he would consider the proposals submitted to him by the deputation of vignerons, and he seemed favorable to some of them; but we have had no intimation of the extent to which the Minister has embodied the views of the vignerons in the amendments he has prepared, and it will be utterly impossible for those honorable members who are specially interested in the Rill to approach the consideration of the amendments without having an opportunity of seeing them beforehand. </para>

                        <para>- It is a little hard that when we propose to take a step in order to meet the views of those who wish the clause to be amended, we should "be met with the suggestion that the matter should be postponed for a while. I confess that last week I thought that the honorable member for Echuca would welcome an amendment of this kind, and I would suggest that we should at once proceed to discuss it. As 1 have explained, the Bill, as it stands, provides for only one kind of spirit-maker's licence, for which a fee of £50 has to be paid. This was objected to by the deputation of vignerons, who pointed out that, in Victoria especially, a brandy-maker's licence at £10 was provided for. We discussed the question, and the conclusion to which we came was, that a brandy-maker's licence might fairly be issued, but that the £10 fee would be rather too little in view of the privileges conferred. After discussion, it was practically agreed that £25 would be a fair fee to charge, and we are now proposing to add to the descriptions of licences that may be granted, a brandy-maker's licence at a fee of £25. </para>

                        <para>- There has been no such provision in any of the States, except Victoria, in regard to a brandy-maker's licence. That is the reason why the provision was not originally inserted. But on looking further into the question, we thought it would not be unfair, whilst not permitting the issue of a licence at £10 - which is the fee in Victoria - to meet the case by providing that, instead of having the right to distil whatever he pleased, the licensee should distil only for brandy-making purposes from colonial wine. Therefore, we have introduced this provision, and have raised the fee to .£25. </para>

                        <para>- I hasten to reassure the honorable member that I never suggested that any honorable member was trying to delay the passage of the Bill. The honorable member for Echuca has said that the Government ought to have been more prepared than we are. Our time is pretty well engaged one way or the other, and I think that the committee will sympathize with us in the matter. In talking about the sum to be charged, and in suggesting that in New South Wales distillers possess additional privileges to those pOSsessed by distillers here, I think the honorable member was altogether wrong. I think so for two reasons. The first is that I do not know where in New South Wales any preference is given for the encouragement of local distillers. I know that they have not a single distillery there. </para>

                        <para>- They have distilleries for which a licence fee of £1 is charged. There are 70 of them. The privilege conferred there is to distil spirits for the purpose of fortifying their wines. It is not intended to permit them to distil generally for the purposes of sale. The provision which we are now discussing is, subject to a licence, to permit of them distilling brandy from grapes and selling it. To attempt to compare licences such as we propose with any licences existing in New South Wales is absurd. I do not see the possibility of instituting a comparison. The one confers a very valuable privilege and the other does not. As regards the question of the name to be given to the various licences I do not attach very much importance to that. But I would point out that the £10 licence in Victoria allows a man to distil .spirits from wine or the lees of wine. Of course brandy is the article which they turn out from grape products. I .think we may fairly adopt the term which we propose, but if on looking at the matter further the committee think that we ought to adopt a different term, well, what is in a name ? </para>

                        <para>- White spirit. They might sell that white spirit to the chemists or anybody else. Why are they to be confined to colouring and flavouring, and converting the spirit into brandy? Why deprive them of the right of utilizing their products to their own advantage? Why should these products be wasted, and the business thrown into the hands of large distillers? Wine distillers' licences have been asked for at a higher cost and under stricter supervision,and if under any regulations, which the Minister chooses to make, these growers can have the right to utilize to the last scrap their products and waste products, I see no reason why they should be limited to one particular class of spirit. The proposal may possibly defeat the object of the request which has been made ; and this proposal takes me by surprise. There were no remarks at either of the deputations which I had the honour to accompany, pressing this view on the Minister, who will recollect he was specially asked whether he had any objections to place before the practical men then present. </para>

We have not yet come to the time when it is necessary to discuss the question what we shall call the licence, whether a wine distiller's, or a brandy maker's licence. From wine, brandy is produced, and undoubtedly the discussion proceeded on no smaller question such as is now suggested, but on the general question of the distilling of brandy. </para>

We propose in due course to alter the schedule of fees, so that whilst the original charge of £1 shall apply generally, the fee for any test still licence for a still, not exceeding one quart in capacity, shall be a shilling. It is merely a question of notice, and of having a check. </para>

A case came under my notice where an assayer in Charters Towers was fined £50 for having a still in his possession. The Judge said at the time that he was compelled to inflict a fine, but the penalty &gt;vas ultimately remitted, as there was no attempt to evade the Customs in any way. </para>

                        <para>- This provision would not cover stills used for the distillation of water, avid it would be monstrous if it did. I do not think we have any right to prohibit or regulate stills used, for instance, for the distillation of salt water in Western Australia. What we have a right to do is to regulate stills as far as is necessary for the protection or the revenue in connexion with the excise, and the Bill is intended to apply only to such cases. </para>

                        <para>- The provision ought not to apply to such cases, and I do not think it does apply.

There are a variety of processes in manufactures and arts in which a still is necessary, and the Government ought to have control, because, although ostensibly used for manufacturing purposes, such stills might be utilized for distilling spirits. </para>

I know a case in which a chemist was in possession of an old still for years, and did not know what it was. I do not know what the Government can do, unless they make every one who has a still register it ; if a still be used legitimately, there will be no difficulty in registering. </para>

                        <para>- That is not for me to suggest. The honorable member for Mernda said just now that for the protection of the revenue stills should be registered whether they are called condensing or freshwater stills. In regard to the interjection of the honorable member for Coolgardie, I would point out that some of the Kalgoorlie mining companies in which I am interested sell from 20,000 to 30,000 gallons of water every 24 hours for condensation purposes. The water is used for the supply of the fields. </para>

                        <para>- Where our right extends the State right is subordinate. We look at what is usual in determining this point, and I think I am justified in saying we invariably find a provision of this sort in the State laws. All the Acts with which I am familiar have a provision of this character in their very forefront. The departmental officers must know what is going on in relation to these stills. If they do not know where the stills are situate they are sure to be defrauded. The object of this clause is that no new stills shall be set up, or made, or purchased, or transferred, or imported without the knowledge of the department, lt is one thing to have the still in the hands of an honest man, and another thing to have it transferred to a man who is not known. It is not to enable the department to arbitrarily refuse consent that we make this provision, but in order that we may know what is being done in regard to the introduction, setting up, or change in ownership of stills. </para>

                        <para>- I think it clearly is. Then there is the other point. The wish of the Government was not to interfere unnecessarily with stills which are not likely to be used for illicit distillation. We may be too lax or too severe, but while we do not want to interfere unnecessarily with the owners of stills, we do not desire to lose revenue. We have tried to draw a certain line, which we think is a fair one. The matter is, however, of grave importance. We will look into it carefully and see whether we have a proper definition of what is a still. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but I shall have to take the schedule first. Under this clause we come to a matter which we debated at some length - namely, what is the duty of the distiller in regard to the provision of accommodation. A suggestion was made from the other side of the committee, and what we propose to do is this. We propose to strike out the arbitrary definition of the circumstances under which a distiller shall be called upon to provide accommodation, and to make the clause read that accommodation shall be provided when required by the collector. I propose afterwards to introduce a clause providing that any person providing board and lodging pursuant to the request of the collector shall be entitled to fair remuneration therefor, at such rates as may be agreed upon or prescribed. I do not like the idea of board and lodging at all. It may be necessary in some cases, but, I hope, very few. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I am supported in what I propose, not only by my slight knowledge of Customs work, acquired by following mercantile pursuits during a number of years, but also by the opinions of the wine makers and distillers of South Australia, who say that, in addition to the three purposes mentioned in the clause, removal should be authorised for the three other purposes which I have named. Surely it is reasonable to suppose that spirits may be removed from a distillery for the purpose of fortifying colonial wine without paying duty, as if they were intended for home consumption ? </para>

                        <para>- It will not. Are colonial wines to be kept in a warehouse, unless there is an excise duty put upon them? Will the distiller who has in one branch of his premises a distillery, and in another a winery, have to put the wines into a warehouse, if he removes spirits from the distillery to the winery for the purpose of fortification, or if he sell his spirits to another vigneron perhaps a mile away, under prescribed supervision, will they have to go into warehouse? Can this removal be spoken of as removal for home consumption? With all due deference to the Minister's advisers, I say that it cannot ; and unless the reasons for removal which I wish to add are inserted in the clause it will create confusion to persons in the trade. </para>

                        <para>- That clause provides that a distiller may, subject to certain conditions, methylate spirits in his distillery, and, perhaps, in view of that provision, it is not so important to provide in clause 41 for the removal of spirits for methylation ; but it is undoubtedly important to give distillers the right to remove spirits from their distilleries for the purpose of fortifying wines in another building - of course under proper conditions - and for the manufacture of vinegar: The distillers and wine-makers have put it to us very clearly that it is necessary to use spirits for fortification purposes, and there are strong reasons why the proposed paragraphs should be included in the clause. </para>

Not only the principal persons in South Australia who are interested in the Bill have asked for the insertion of the words now suggested, but I have this morning received a communication from a conference of Australian vignerons making a similar request. </para>

                        <para>- When a man having ten acres of vineyard is entitled to the privileges conferred by a vigneron's licence, ought not a similar privilege to be granted to men who have banded themselves together and established a winery, are purchasing grapes and manufacturing wine ? A winery, I venture to think, is a great boon to any district, and a great advantage to wine-growers particularly. It is something on the lines of the local butter factory. It is infinitely better to have wineries established than to have a lot of little stills dotted all over the place. Where a winery is an establishment of the character referred to, where it is benefiting a district to the extent of purchasing 200 tons of grapes annually, and where any possibility of difficulty can be avoided not only by requiring proof of this, but by limiting the operation of the clause to cases where the winery is declared by proclamation, I think the provision is as safe as safe can be. </para>

                    <para>To-day the grower should be the wine-maker ; his perishable crop should not be under the whip hand of the wine-maker. As soon as the capacity of the wine-maker's cellar is reached he will not buy, and the grapes rot in the vineyard. These and other changes in prevailing conditions put the grower of grapes at his wits' end to dispose of his crop. In 1895, 350 tons of grapes were wasted, and 250 tons sold at unremunerative prices. One hundred acres of vines were uprooted in one locality alone. </para>

                        <para>- It has been highly conducive to the interests of the large companies running the show, but it has not been to the advantage or protection of the small individual who is trying to make a home for himself and his family. There is no one in this House who seeks to perpetuate the evils which have existed in New South Wales. We had a lack of supervision there which rendered possible evasion of the revenue. There was no proper control by the Customs in regard to the time at which and the places in which spirits were made. But surely the genius of the Minister and his officers can find some way by which, consistently with the issue of licences to distil to small vignerons, we can safeguard the revenue by insuring that they shall distil only in the presence of a Customs officer, and on the payment of a fee which will not be beyond their means. I trust that honorable members will hesitate before they consent to a clause which practically wipes out of existence the small vignerons right through the country districts of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- Surely the honorable member has not read the clause. In New South Wales, under the present law, if the vignerons have 2 acres or more of vines, they have a right to distil for fortifying purposes. This clause proposes to place the minimum area at 10 acres. The result of such a provision, if adopted, will be that all those vignerons who possess between 2 acres and 10 acres will have to surrender their stills to the Government. Moreover, these people, having no outlet for their grapes for table purposes, will be compelled to uproot them altogether. </para>

But are we to confess that it is beyond the inventive genius of the Minister to propound a scheme which will protect the revenue, and at the same time not unduly harass and hamper these people ? I do not know that there is a very large number of vignerons with 2 acres and under. I know, however, that there is a considerable number who have less than 5 acres. </para>

                        <para>- If there were any difference in the quality, I think it would be to the advantage of South Australia. Whether the area should be two acres I am not prepared to say, but I should like to hear from the Minister what his justification is for proposing ten acres, and whether he does not think such a provision would play into the hands of the companies who can fix the price they pay for grapes. </para>

                    <para>- It is quite clear that if the Bill passes as drafted, it will mean death to the small growers scattered over this continent. In New South Wales particularly, the number of growers is very large, and the area cultivated very small ; but I venture to say that the growers who occupy the small areas are capable of making excellent wine, as I believe they do. </para>

                        <para>- But the proposal of the Minister will undoubtedly do so. If the proposal does not obliterate the small man altogether, it will bring about a fall in the price of his primary product, or will so hamper him with restrictions as to compel him to abandon his business. That is precisely what we do not want to do. We want to protect the revenue and make the supervision as efficient and adequate as possible ; but at the same time we ought to do nothing to interfere with the number of small growers who are trying their very best to make a living for themselves and their families. It is proved that just as good wine can be made by the small manufacturer as by the large one, by the fact that the prizes as a rule go to the former. Seeing that the revenue need not necessarily suffer by continuing the privileges these small men now have, and seeing that the quality of the wine need not suffer, there seems to be no reason why the Minister should seek to centre the wine production in the hands of a small number of rich individuals, and to deprive the smaller growers of the privileges they should undoubtedly enjoy. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Minister will take into consideration what has been urged by several honorable members. In Western Australia grape growing is almost a new industry amongst the small farmers, and it would be some encouragement to them if they were allowed to have the licences asked for. For years even in Western Australia growers have been obliged to sell at a sacrifice to those who were in a better position to make wine, and I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- They ought to be, but very often they are not. The ordinary question of supply and demand must be considered. I apprehend that the men who own these central factories keep them going for the purpose of making money out of them. The must have the produce, and they must pay a fair price for it in order to get it. With regard to wine making it seems to me that if we look at the matter fairly we shall see that this is a proposal which is certainly in the direction of concentrating the industry, and giving the small growers an advantage in relation to the sale of their grapes which they cannot possess individually. Throughout Prance, Switzerland, Germany, and other European wine growing countries, the great hulk of the grapes are grown by small men, who take them to central establishments, where they are converted into wine. The great drawback to the industry in Australia is that there are so many small lots of wine, all differing in quality, that no settled market can be obtained for them. The sooner the industry is organized on reasonable principles - and this is one slight step in that direction - so as to secure a uniform quality of wine, the sooner we shall have a successful and large trade. It is the same in regard to the manufacture of butter. Until the small maker was superseded by the central creamery and butter factory we could never produce butter for export. Honorable members know what a change has taken place. The principle is identical, and it is even more necessary in the case of wine making that we should centralize the industry. There is no objection whatever in the interests of the small men to the proposal made by the Government. Above all, the necessity for the Government's action must be apparent, if it be true, as the Minister has indicated - and as I, with many other honorable members, believe - that the small stills lead to an immense amount of illicit distillation and demoralize the districts in which they are situated. </para>

                        <para>- I think that if there is one thing of which honorable members generally will acquit Ministers, it is of having any intention whatever to unnecessarily harass the small man. The small man very often constitutes, by aggregation, the bulk of the industry. I was a little bit surprised to hear so much force thrown into the criticism of the clause as it stands, when the matter to which I had just drawn attention was rather an extension of its terms in the direction of liberalism. </para>

                <para>M!r. KINGSTON.- The other matter had not been discussed at all. No doubt some of us - I am sometimes guilty Of it myself - speak with more apparent force at times than the occasion justifies. The point which has been put is that we should not crush the small man who owns a still. We do not intend to do anything of the sort. We let him go on. </para>

The next point made by the honorable member for Bland was that the proposed amendment was, to a great extent, supported by a quotation which he read from Professor Perkins, our highly respected agriculturist. I have not the whole extract here, but I do not think that it applies to the question of distillation. </para>

                        <para>- It applies to the man with 15 and 20 acres and more. I ana strongly of opinion, from what I. know of Professor Perkins, that in the report in question he is dealing generally with the desirability of vine-growers associating; that instead of being compelled to sell their grapes and perishable commodities for that which they can get when at the mercy of a monopolist in a grape-buying district, they should associate for the purpose of establishing central wineries - just as central creameries and dairies have been established - and thus secure a market for their produce, and get the fullest benefit from the turning of their grapes into wine, just as dairymen do now from turning their milk into butter. Then there is another point : The existing conditions are altogether insecure, as regards the protection of the revenue - there is no get away from that. In my reply, on the second reading debate, I put this point very strongly, but to-day I can speak even more strongly upon it, because I have since had the advantage of meeting the vine-growers. They do not hesitate to tell me that the position is not as it ought to be ; that the Customs officials rely for protection of the revenue on returns and occasional visits. </para>

                    <para>The wine business is merely in the hands of the large growers almost exclusively. The small growers grow grapes and sell them. Personally, I have been opposed to this arrangement, not taking the part of the small grower against the big, but on the stand that, as the arrangements exist at present, the grape-growers are on one side, and wine-makers on the other. The acreage under vines will not extend because the prices offered for grapes were not such as to encourage the vignerons to extend their vineyards. The price paid for Mataro has gone as low as 30s. per ton. The small grower would make two or three times as much by manufacturing the wine. </para>

I am agreeable to adopt the 5-acre instead of 10-acre limit, and reserve all rights to present licensees. A great deal has been said about the success of small vineyards, and 1 wish them every success ; but I think, on examination, it will be found that the money which has been made has been derived from wine-making and not from the distillation of spirits. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the leader of the equal rights party has not adhered to his 2-acre proposal, because if it is a good thing that spirits should be manufactured, why should the small man be shut out and opportunities be given to the monopolist ? It seems to me that if it is a good tiling for the morals of the community that every facility should be offered for wine-making, the minimum should be reduced down to an acre. Why should the 2-acre man have to depend upon the 5-acre man? It appears quite unreasonable to allow a man who has now a still on a 2-acre vineyard to continue to use that still, and to refuse a similar privilege to a new man unless he can show that he is the possessor of 5 acres of vineyard. Instead of promoting freedom we are bringing about a condensation of tyranny and monopoly. </para>

                    <para>- The Minister, I understand, has stated that he will endeavour to meet the honorable member for Echuca by an amendment of the interpretation clause. I would suggest that the Minister had better walk very warily, because " officer " means an officer of Customs who has all sorts of powers under the Bill. Notwithstanding the great value we all attribute to the constabulary and the justiciary of the peace, it will, nevertheless, be undesirable to enlarge the interpretation of "officer" to any material extent. An amendment of the interpretation clause would either give a great deal more power to extra persons than they ought to possess, or would interfere with the artistic character of the drafting. We should have a general interpretation of " officer," and, at the same time, a restriction of that definition in a certain specified clause. I am afraid that if the Minister extends the meaning to meet one case, he will be giving power, under other clauses of the Bill, to persons whom he does not intend should possess them ; and it would be much wiser if he wishes to extend the definition of the person who may do this particular duty, to extend it in this clause and not in the interpretation clause. We know what wide interpretations often lead to in the law courts. </para>

                        <para>- There is a good deal in what the honorable and learned member says, and further consideration will be required as to the best way of meeting the difficulty. But the amendment of the definition which I have in my mind would, I think, enable what we desire to be done in a limited way, and, at the same time, would meet the views of the honorable member for Echuca. </para>

                    <para>- There was slight misapprehension over a similar clause, and I then accepted the assurance of the Minister that another clause would be inserted providing for reasonable remuneration. But in the previous clause we provided that there should be a penalty of £50, and attached to the present clause is a penalty of £20. I do not think there ought to be such a penalty. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think the Minister quite sees the full extent of the provision. The collector will probably not make himself personally acquainted with the situation of a vineyard, and may give his directions from Melbourne or from some far-distant place. I did not raise the question on a similar provision applying to the big distiller, but it becomes much more important when it refers to the small vigneron. Why should the collector have power to require board and lodging to be supplied, unless some distance from an hotel is specified ? </para>

                        <para>- A vigneron might have to build for the purpose of providing accommodation for the officer, and yet he is only to receive remuneration for meals and bedroom. Some of these vignerons have just sufficient room for their own families, and it is very hard indeed that they should be compelled under a penalty to provide lodging and accommodation to the satisfaction of the collector, and yet receive only remuneration in part. In connexion with the smaller men such a provision ought not to be in the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- The opinion of those in South Australia best able to judge is that to use spirit 50 degrees above proof would be very detrimental to the better classes of their wines. In some wines they frequently use well-matured old brandy of a strength very little above proof, but a provision such as that in the clause would prevent them from fortifying those wines with such spirit, and would require them to use crude high-proof spirit which would materially affect their flavour. It has been suggested that the Minister should be allowed a discretionary power in this matter, and amongst the amendments of which I have given notice is the omission of the words " of at least fifty degrees above proof," with a view to inserting " approved by the collector." </para>

                        <para>- If we provided that spirit 35 degrees above proof should be used, that would be too strong for some of the superior fine flavoured wines. So many differences arise by reason of the variety in character of the wines that have to be fortified that it is necessary that the collector should be able to use his discretion in determining the strength of spirit to be used. If. it were fixed absolutely at 35 degrees above proof it might be too high, and if fixed at proof it might be too low. </para>

There is a much larger question at stake than the convenience of a section of those who make wine, and that is the character of Australian wines. I regret that so many facilities are given to vignerons under the Bill to fortify their wines. </para>

                        <para>- Under clause 57 vignerons are allowed to go to any bond and take out spirits on which duty, if any, has been paid. A case came under my observation where application was made by a very large vigneron to use a certain quantity of spirits for fortification, but permission was not given to him, because, in the opinion of the Government officer, the spirit applied for would be deleterious to the wine. Nevertheless the man was prepared to add that spirit to his wine, and then send it out for consumption. I understand that the distillers of Adelaide have asked that certain alterations shall be made in the Bill, one of which is it i the direction of allowing potatoes to be used for the purpose of distillation, so that it might be possible for that spirit to be used for fortification. I think that 35 per cent, over proof is quite high enough, and that we shall not be doing our duty if we allow the determination of the strength to fluctuate at the will of the Minister or of the collector. </para>

                    <para>- I think the limit of proof should be stated in the Bill, because unless it is the vigneron will never know to what strength he must distil his spirit, and, not knowing what strength the collector may require, he must distil to a higher strength than he would otherwise do. In many cases the small stills will not distil up to a high strength. Some of them will not distil more than 25 to 30 per cent, overproof. If the matter is to be left open the wine-grower will have no idea of the strength to which he will require to distil. I certainly think that we shall be safe in following the present practice of allowing 25 per cent, overproof. </para>

It was represented subsequently by others that in New South Wales the stills are of less capacity, and that 25 per cent, would be quite high enough for them. It is our desire to meet their wishes if we can do so. It would be a very wrong thing not to fix any limit. We should let the vignerons know what they have to do.

                        <para>- But I suggest a still further reduction. If the honorable gentleman cannot do so, then I shall be in favour of having the strength "as prescribed." I am assured, in the first place, that 35 per cent, strength would not only be contrary to the view put forward by the honorable member for Laanecoorie, but absolutely beyond the possibility of working out with the stills already in existence in many parts of New South Wales. They will have to get new stills if anything above 25 or 28 per cent, overproof is proposed. Experts put it forward that if the vignerons go above 30 per cent, overproof, grain spirit is just as good as spirit made from wine, for the reason that all the characteristic elements of the wine spirit are taken out with the higher distillation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say it is, but nevertheless it is held by a great number of experts. They say that if wine is distilled at too high a strength, the characteristic aroma and other good points are lost. If that is so, it would be manifestly foolish to insist on the one hand upon a high strength of spirit, and on the other upon only wine being employed. Personally, I think tod or the lees should be used, but we should not place the minimum so high as to prevent it from being effectively employed. In view of the fact that nearly all the stills in New South Wales are incapable of distilling at a higher strength than somewhere about 30 per cent, overproof, I would urge the Minister to reduce the minimum strength below -35 per cent., or allow it to be prescribed by regulation. </para>

                        <para>- The idea of the distillers of Adelaide - with some of whom I have had a chat in regard to these proposals - is that if the officer approves in any case, that that case ought to be made an exception to the 50 degrees proposed in the Bill, because they say he is an expert. It seems to me that their reasoning is upheld by the Minister, because he wants now to make the approval of the officer a condition in all these oases. There must naturally be 35 degrees. </para>

                        <para>- It is intended for the regulation of the collection of excise revenue and all matters incidental thereto. It is very proper in connexion with distillation to provide not only what rates shall be charged for the goods going into home consumption, but the mode .in which the spirits, whilst they are under our control, shall be utilized. I know that it is very difficult to avoid the point at which a doubt can be raised as to where federal jurisdiction ends and State rights commence. For that reason I have left out some clauses which not unusually appear in Distillation Bills. I have striven to avoid trespassing on State rights. In clauses which simply give facilities for the distillation of spirits to be used in a certain way, it may be possible that certain privileges with regard to duties may be attached, and it is right that we should say how that right should be exercised, and to what it should extend. We are simply limiting what we intend to be done, and declaring the intention of the Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- We are simply prescribing in what respect and to what extent these provisions are to be made, how they shall be exercised. Surely we have a right, in the fixing of any duty, to say that this excisable commodity shall go at this or that rate and on certain conditions for a specific purpose. I sympathize with what has been said by the honorable member for Laanecoorie - that it is a pity that we cannot have wines altogether pure. There is a prejudice naturally against fortification, and I am hopeful that our wines will largely sustain the reputation they have acquired on account of their purity, and because of the absence from them of all but the natural spirit in the wine itself. We know that whilst fortification can be dispensed with in a great many cases, experts state that it cannot be dispensed with in others, and that particularly in regard to wine for export it is not only necessary in order to suit the taste of the consumers in those countries to which the wines are exported, but to preserve it during the voyage, that a certain amount of spirit should be used. We have been considerably troubled in determining what the limit should be. We have had the advantage of the advice of our officers. We proposed originally that the strength should be 50 per cent. above proof. There is no doubt whatever that the greater the strength the greater the purity. </para>

                        <para>- It is not necessary to enter into a full discussion of that subject at the present moment, but we are prepared to take the Bill in the shape that is now proposed. We have met the objection to the extent of reducing the strength of the spirits to 35 per cent., and we also propose to accept the provision as to the collector. We are perfectly prepared, seeing that it is quite possible that some fresh light may come necessitating a different course of action which should not involve the passing of a Bill, to take power by regulation to deal with the matter further. We desire to be reasonable, and if the committee will co-operate with us to that extent we will make these amendments. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The fitness of the spirit for the use to which it is to be applied. And I think the clause shows plainly enough what is intended. If a vigneron desires to use spirit for fortifying wine, the officer will have to apply his expert knowledge, and say whether it is fit to be used for that purpose. There will not be that absence of uniformity which the honorable and learned member for Indi suggests, because we shall have federal control, and it would be simply monstrous if we were to allow one rule to apply in one part of the Commonwealth and another rule in some other part. All the distiller has to do is to get the approval of the officer, but the officer will have to carry out instructions from head-quarters which will apply to all the States, and require the exercise of discretion on ordinary lines in every particular case. I do not anticipate any difficulty, but if the honorable and learned member would like the clause to provide that the spirit should be approved of by the officer " as fit for such use," I would not object to make the necessary amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The purity of spirit is judged by its effect upon the human constitution, and, so far as that is concerned, harshness is very undesirable. If crude harsh spirit is used for fortifying delicate wine, it destroys all the fine flavour and aroma that should properly belong to the wine, and I think that we might very well make the concession now desired. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it, because that will leave the matter entirely open for consideration when the Tariff is introduced. The next point is in connexion with the Tariff also, and it is better to mention it now, because it should receive the serious consideration of the Minister. In America the Federal Congress has, with the same object in view as I have just referred to, namely, the maintenance and the improvement of the reputation of American wines, adopted in its Tariff Bill of 1890 provisions calculated to effect that desirable end ; and the Minister will find in the Acts of Congress .of 1890, cap. 1244, a portion of the' Tariff Bill which is called the Internal Revenue portion - clause 42 and subsequent clauses - -a series of provisions very ingeniously, very carefully," and very fully framed for the purpose of advancing the cause of American viticulture. The mode in which that is effected is, roughly speaking, as follows : - Wine producers, who are also licensees of a still, are at liberty to use, free of duty, wine spirit for the fortification of the wines they produce, and, in addition to that, wine producers are at liberty to use, also free of duty, wine spirit procured from the warehouse in bond and taken to their own vineyard, and there used under the strictest supervision. All the details are given in the Act to which I have referred - except details which are dealt with by regulation - and as the whole matter is set out very fully, one can there see the means by which great encouragement is given both to the production of wine spirit and to the production of wine itself. Besides that, the plan there adopted* has the advantage of securing the reputation of American wines in this regard, that it is known that a strong inducement "is given in America to use pure wine spirit. That is what we ought to do here. In Victoria the State law already provides that only wine spirit shall be used in the fortification of wines, and it is a pity that a similar law is not in force in the other States. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is the case in France. I am informed so, at any rate. I think it would be very advantageous if we were able to place before the world the fact that Australian wine can be regarded as free from foreign spirit. We know that wine spirit mixed with wine improves it, and that wine so blended improves with age. But if it is mixed with inferior spirit, such as potato spirit - which is a dead spirit - we know that it will not improve, but will, on the contrary, deteriorate. It has proved an excellent advertisement for Victorian wines that these regulations are in force here. I ask the Minister with a view to preserving and enhancing the reputation of Australian wines, and of encouraging the production of wines of a high and uniform class, to do what was done in 1890 by congress in America, namely, to encourage the production of wines fortified with wine spirit. In the annual report for 1889 and 1890 of the board of the State Viticultural Commissioners of California a very full account is given of this matter. I should be glad if the Minister would have that report looked into by his officers, because he will there see what a long struggle they had in California to secure the passage of that Act. It has been regarded as a triumph for viticulturists there, and I think that a similar method, if adopted here, would have the most beneficial results. </para>

                        <para>- I have looked carefully into the matter, and have arrived at the conclusion that at present it is entirely a question of the terms upon which the spirit is delivered. Under these circumstances I do not see how we can deal with it here. It is a question of whether we shall give the wine merchants power to clear spirits free of duty for purposes of fortification." I do not think this is the time to deal with the matter. It must he a question for consideration when the Tariff is under discussion. </para>

                    <para>- If the matter is not dealt with now, I feel that it will not be dealt with at all. The position is one which is not only of advantage to the wine merchants but also to the vignerons. The smaller vignerons have a quantity of wine upon their hands. The merchant will purchase only the best quality of it. Only the larger vignerons who have stills can fortify their wine, whereas, if the merchants possessed the same privilege and could obtain their spirits free for the purposes of fortification or upon payment of such duty as may be fixed, our vignerons would have a double market. There are more than 100 wine merchants in Melbourne alone. The object of the amendment is to help the smaller growers. </para>

                    <para>- I do not see that any necessity exists for specifying who shall possess power to purchase spirit for the purposes of fortification. If such a necessity did exist we should have had to provide that all those vignerons within the Commonwealth who have not stills of their own shall have the power to purchase spirit. In Victoria there is a considerable number of wine merchants who have not stills of their own and who have to purchase spirit for fortification purposes. I apprehend that the wine merchants occupy exactly the same position. All that this Bill prescribes is the conditions under which stills shall be used and by whom they shall be used. Who. shall obtain wine for the purposes of fortification is altogether another question. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the practice should be made uniform. It must appeal to the common sense of honorable members that to fortify Australian wine with spirit the product of roots, grain, or any substance from which spirit has to be made by the addition of sulphuric acid in order to extract the sugar from the starch, is not at all a proper proceeding. Therefore, in the interests of the wine-growers themselves, the amendment is one which should be strongly supported by this committee. </para>

                    <para>- New South Wales was represented, and a very strong expression of opinion was given that some provision of the kind should be made in order to strengthen the reputation of Australian wines. The amendment suggested was that spirit used in the fortification of Australian wines should be restricted to pure wine spirit. It was considered by the conference that, inasmuch as the Bill contains a provision as to the alcoholic strength of Australian wines, there should be no objection to going a little further and limiting the alcohol used to pure wine spirit. </para>

                        <para>- I may speak of South Australia, because I happen to have lived there for so many years, and because it is a State in which vine-growing and wine-making have assumed very considerable, and important proportions, which I hope will be imitated in other parts of the Commonwealth before long to even a greater extent.From the start I have said candidly that the information I had to give to the committee, and the amendments I have moved, have been given to me and instigated by a large number of wine-growers and distillers of South Australia, who are my constituents. These gentlemen have given me that information in the same way as the vignerons of Victoria have given information to the honorable members for Echuca, Indi, and Bendigo, none of whom, I suppose, has any great personal knowledge of wine-making or distilling. I should like the Minister to ascertain whether, by passing this amendment, we preclude, not only potato spirit, but spirit made from wheat, barley, and malt - spirit which at the present time is being sold in Victoria. We know perfectly well that some of the Victorian brandy we hear so much about contains a large proportion of spirit distilled from wheat. </para>

                        <para>- But when we place in the four corners of the Bill a provision of the sort proposed, we maybe imposing a restraint on trade and manufacturing industry, and it would be just as well to look more closely into the matter, and see whether we are justified on grounds of health, or from the point of view of the improvement of the wines, in going to that extent. I think it is fairly recognised that potato spirit is somewhat detrimental to wines, though personally I am not quite certain of the fact. "We may, however, admit that potato spirit does not improve Australian wines ; but to include in this bar, spirit that can be distilled from grain, and which is being distilled every day, I think is wrong. I admit I am speaking without any definite knowledge on the subject, and I would ask the honorable and learned member for Indi. not to press his amendment now, but to have the clause recommitted later on, when we have a reprint of the Bill, and we are able to speak with more definite knowledge, having put the question fairly and properly before the various manufacturers. </para>

                    <para>- Has the Minister reconsidered the question whether the licence-fee is not too high ? It is a great jump from £10 to £50for a licence-fee which applies to all sizes of distilleries. A distillery which turns out only 3,000 or 4,000 gallons has to pay the same amount as a distillery which turns out 300,000 or 400,000 gallons. </para>

                    <para>- I take it that the licence the Minister is providing for is equivalent to what is known in the State of Victoria as a vineyard-still licence, which gives the licensee only the right to distil spirits from grapes the produce of his own vineyard. I think, therefore, that the fee provided for is too high, because the distillation that is done under these licences is. very limited, and it takes place under conditions which allow of no abuse of the regulations, and no loss to the revenue. At present there are, I think, seven or eight of these licensees in Victoria, and they pay £10 a year each for their licences. </para>

                        <para>- To my knowledge at least two of them will go out of the business if a licence-fee of £25 is imposed. After distillation, a considerable length of time is required to enable the spirit to mature sufficiently to be put upon the market, and I know 'one distiller who has gone to the expense of erecting a plant and paying a licence-fee for five years, but who, up to the present has reaped no benefit from the enterprise, except by the distillation of a certain amount of spirit for the fortification of wine made from grapes other than the Guard a Blanca from which he distils. It occurred to me, when a comparison was made by an honorable member of the value of the grapes in some of the States, that perhaps in one case a class of grape was used for wine making which was not suitable, but which would have been very suitable for raisin making. </para>

                        <para>- We have provided that people who have stills shall not be harassed, and we have made liberal provision for the continuance of existing rights. These £10 licensees have for years enjoyed privileges which other distillers in the Commonwealth have not enjoyed, and to ask that the £10 licence-fee shall be continued to them is, I think, unfair. They have not hitherto been paying sufficient for the services required by them of the Customs officers, because it costs the department as much to control these small distilleries, from which they get only £10 a year, as it costs to control the large general distilleries for which they are paid a fee of £50 a year. I think that in matters of this sort we must be uniform. Although I should like to meet hard cases, if we adopted the honorable member's suggestion, we should be introducing a system which we could not defend, because we should be making competition throughout Australia unequal. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the amount of guarantee required from general distillers is too large. It is double the amount at present required. Many small distillers turn out only 700 or 800 gallons a year, and, by making these sums too high, we play into the bands of the big men. In Queensland there are six distilleries, which produce amongst them 150,000 gallons per year. I do not know what the guarantee is there, but in Victoria it is two of £500 each. Now it is proposed to require two of £1,000 each. What is the reason for the alteration. In the case of a vigneron's still, how is a man with 5 acres of a vineyard going to get a guarantee of £500'! The conference considered the point, and said this could not possibly be done. They suggested that the guarantee should remain as it is at the present time. It is quite enough for any man with from 2 to 5 acres to find. I should like the Minister to say why these rates have been doubled. </para>

                    <para>- Does the Minister in charge of the Bill think that security will have to be given for each test still? Under clause 12 licences are to issue for the use of stills. Paragraph (c) of that clause refers to the use of test stills, and in the remaining paragraphs reference is made to other stills for distilling spirits. There is a slight doubt as to whether a licence will not be necessary for each test still. I am informed by some of the . vignerons that in certain cases they have as many as six test stills on their premises. It may be, therefore, that a separate licence and a separate security will be required for each. It is a matter of doubt, and I merely advance it for consideration. </para>

I think it would be well for the Minister to take power to licence any kind of still.

                        <para>- In order to save the time of the excise officers, the Government propose to give the public inferior liquor, and to crush out a lot of the distillers now carrying on business. I think the Minister has not looked into this matter sufficiently. I would like to know if he could tell us how this proposed change would affect the distillers now carrying on business in the Commonwealth. Have any inquiries been made, or have these provisions been submitted to the distillers with a view to ascertaining how they would be affected? It seems to me that this is simply an officers' Bill, framed to suit themselves, without regard to the industry they are dealing with. </para>

                        <para>- We are not dealing with a Health Bill, but with an Excise Bill, and our duty is to see that whilst proper facilities are given for distillation, the revenue is properly protected. Under the Customs Bill, those who carry on businesses that require Customs supervision have to pay for that supervision, and I think that those who carry on distilleries ' should be equally prepared to defray the cost of properly protecting the revenue. The Government are proposing to issue vignerons' licences at £5 each, and if proper Supervision is to be exercised over the operations of these stills, it will involve a cost of probably five times the amount of the licence fees. I think that those who are interested in the distilleries should not push the Minister so hard after the extreme concessions which have been made. </para>

I hope that now that this is clear to him he will not persist in his amendment, but rather accept that of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, which sufficiently meets the case with regard to winemakers' stills. I know that, despite the remarks made from time to time, the Government are acquitted of any desire to oppress the small distillers. </para>

                        <para>- I have yet to learn that the Customs department pay their officers £350 a year and travelling expenses in every case. The still licensees are required to pay £1 a day and railway fare and travelling allowances, and if an officer goes from a distillery to supervise the mixing of spirits in a store, he has to be paid for at the rate of three shillings an hour. The Commonwealth will naturally be expected to pay their officers a fair and reasonable remuneration. </para>

                        <para>- They are to be paid for the time occupied in the performance of the duties appertaining to the particular still or store in regard to which they exercise supervision by the holder of the licence. In the face of such a provision I fail to see where the dead loss arises of which the honorable member for Mernda spoke. I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that conditions on a parity with the amount of the licence will be made in regard to the holders of £25 licences. </para>

                        <para>- We propose to make provision for a lesser size as regards the vineyard distilleries. The amendment of the honorable and learned member for Bendigo says, in effect, that as regards the general distillery this provision is good enough, but as regards the vineyard distillery, a lesser capacity should be prescribed. In that I am perfectly agreeable to meet the committee. Over all this is the saving clause that no existing distiller will be prejudiced by an alteration in the capacity. Regulation 4 lays down certain requirements which must be complied with to the satisfaction of the collector in relation to very distillery licensed under a spiritmaker's licence. The vignerons' licences are dealt with separately under regulation 84, and do not apply here. </para>

                    <para>- There has been an awful lot of time wasted over this matter. I cannot understand the action of the honorable member for Echuca in taking such a leading part in this agitation on behalf of the small distiller. I understand that the honorable member is a strong teetotaller. I think that he will occupy a rather unfortunate position so far as the temperance party is concerned when he again faces the electors. His grievance appears to be in determining whether we shall get whisky distilled from pot stills or from patent stills. I do not know that there is a very great difference between the two, but the honorable member thinks that there is. He says, in effect, that the whisky distilled from the patent stills is rank poison, and can be manufactured for about 1s. a gallon. I am really surprised that he should advocate the distillation of whisky from any kind of still. He has told the committee that whisky distilled from pot stills costs 3s. a gallon, but that when it comes from patent stills all sorts of ingredients have to be put into it in order to make it a palatable decoction. He is showing an amount of anxiety over this matter that I cannot understand, because as a temperance man he ought to have taken the opposite course, and have backed up the Minister in trying to do away with distilleries. Such action would have been in the interests of the country and of the party to which the honorable member belongs. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to think that in the case of a general distillery 500 gallons is not too large for the minimum capacity of a vat. We do not want to have a number of small vats all over the store, and the minimum prescribed will be a convenient one to the distillers, and advantageous for the purposes of checking. I am prepared, however, to allow vats of a smaller size to be used in a wine distillery. </para>

                        <para>- I venture to think it is a fair thing to keep the clause as it stands. In the administration of an Act of this sort the authorities desire to know the truth. They wish to be assured that when a case of spirits goes out - the purchaser may do what he likes with it afterwards - its place of origin should be known. Accordingly it is declared here that every case going out shall have branded or painted thereon the name of the distiller, or the name of the distillery, and the place where the spirits were distilled. I venture to think that that is a justifiable, simple, and ordinary practice. There is no provision which prevents the case, after it is entered for home consumption, being marked as the purchaser pleases, but in the distillery I think it should be marked with the name of the distiller who has distilled the spirits. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for South Australia has hardly studied this Bill with that close attention which he usually bestows upon matters. I would point out that the spirit store is part of the distillery so far as this provision is concerned. In the distillery we have the still, the spirit store, and the spirit warehouse, which is a Customs warehouse to all intents and purposes. The spirit store in the distillery is the place where the blending is done. When the blending is done then the case is marked in the way provided. </para>

                        <para>- I can assure the honorable and learned member that it cannot. The spirit store is intended for the purpose of flavouring and blending, and it is there that these operations are carried on. The next procedure is as regards removing the cased spirit into the warehouse. I think it is highly essential that the source of security to the Customs conferred by this rule should be preserved. </para>

                        <para>- I can make it abundantly clear that the spirit store is part of the distillery where practically distilling operations are carried on, and where we have the right to see that the cases of spirits bear the brand of the distiller for the security of the revenue and as a guarantee of their genuineness. The scheme of the Bill is to be found in rule 4. There is to be an application for a spirit-maker's licence. Every distillery must comply with certain conditions which are there prescribed. There must be on the premises (1) a material store, or store for the reception of material; (2) a spirit store for the storing of spirits pending warehousing ; (3) a warehouse for the warehousing of spirits. Why this spirit store is provided is clearly set out in rule 41, which says - </para>

                    <para>- I think there is something in the arguments which have been advanced in favor of the amendment. There is no intention on the part of the Customs authorities to follow spirit in its distribution, and see that it carries the name of the distiller or distillery, because, under the circumstances, if the spirit is cleared in casks it can be repacked in any way it is thought fit. In rules 59 and 58 power is taken to interfere quite unnecessarily with the method of packing and distributing spirits, though I would not object to that if it meant that the public would be secured good spirits, but there is no such security. </para>

                        <para>- No, because the spirit can be cleared in casks, and bottled in any way the bottler chooses. If the spirits are going to be duty paid from the spirit store, I do not see why the distiller should be compelled to go to the expense of cases to contain the bottles, as he must do according to rule 58. It would be quite sufficient to have the spirits in bottles delivered loose, if so thought fit, seeing that they might have to be taken just across the road. By rule 59, unless the Minister has some reason beyond that he has stated, we are making provision that has no effect, as regards security to the public, but which will have a very detrimental effect on the distillers and those who purchase from them. </para>

There are numbers of articles which enter into daily consumption, the contents of which we do not know. We can make a general declaration as to the articles from which spirit may be distilled, but it does seem to me that whilst we can do this, that, and the other for the protection of the revenue in a distillery, to go a long way beyond that, as we propose now, and practically to say that every bottle which goes out of a distillery is to bear on it a declaration as to the material of which the contents are composed, is going to a length to which I should be sorry to think the committee is prepared at present to agree. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Minister in charge of the Bill has pressed his argument a great deal too far. In the first place, the vote we carried a moment or two ago was the main one, and this is only consequential upon it. The vote we carried was that if spirits were bottled and then placed in a case the case should bear this information. It is quite evident that without this provision when the bottles are taken out of the case the benefit sought to be derived might be lost. Unfortunately, however, the regulation does not go the length that the Minister supposes. I wish that it did. Even the addition proposed by the honorable member for Echuca will not make it compulsory to put such a label on every bottle. The rule in its unamended form provides that - </para>

                    <para>- The honorable member for Bland has just called attention to a clause in which we have evidently made a very serious slip. He points to that clause as a reason why we should go further, and pass the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Echuca. If the use of the word " person," in clause 75, is going to cover hotel-keepers who are at the present time under different laws in each State, it seems to me that it is going a little beyond the Constitution ; that it is trenching very much on State rights. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether tea is to be dealt with in that Bill as it is in all the States. I think it is dealt with in the different States in the same way, and that the power to legislate in regard to it has been handed over to us. The provision that no person shall break down spirits by the introduction of wine, &amp;c, will undoubtedly interfere with licensed victuallei's, who in all the States are subject already to special legislation. We have special legislation in South Australia dealing with the bottling of wines and spirits, which specifies that imported spirits or imported wines bottled in that State must bear a certain label stating clearly that they are imported, and bottled in South Australia, and giving the name of the person bottling them. Nothing whatever is said about the materials from which they are made. As far as I know the only case in which that requirement is imposed is in regard to poisons under the Goods and Drugs Act. I am pointing out these aspects of the question in order that the Minister may look back, as he said just now, at certain portions of the Bill and see how far we are going. It is useless to pass an Act which trenches on the rights of the States and upon their existing legislation, and which is not well within the limitations of an ordinary Customs Bill or Distillation Act. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. The South Australian measure does not stipulate what the honorable member for Echuca proposes, that the label shall show what the spirits are made from. I quite agree with the honorable member's desire that something of the kind should be done, but I do not think this is the place to do it. It can be better dealt with, and should be dealt with, in a separate measure on the same terms as those relating to the labelling and retailing of imported bottled spirits, but it should not be introduced into this measure. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the honorable member for Bland, that in another case we have already gone as far as the amendment now proposes to go. We have protected the consumer against exhausted tea, and we are protecting the public against wines and spirits of bad quality, and surely we are entitled to go to the length now proposed. All matters relating to distillation have been handed over to us as a Commonwealth, and it becomes our duty to do everything we can to protect the consumer as well as to study the revenue. If any proposal in this direction were brought forward in any of the State Parliaments, its sponsor would be at once met by the objection that any attempt to deal with the matter would be an intrusion upon the realm of the Commonwealth. No arguments can be used against such an amendment as the honorable member has proposed, except those which might be brought forward in the interests of a dishonest distiller. The man who uses proper materials will have nothing to fear from any such restriction. </para>

The proposal of the honorable member for Echuca does not trench in any way upon the rights of the States, but this is the proper place, and now is the proper time, for us to make the provision necessary to protect the consumer against bad spirits. We have something more than the collection of revenue to look after, and that is shown by the instance referred to by the honorable member for Bland.' The statement that no similar provision has been made in any other country in the world surely ought not to weigh with us, seeing that we hope shortly to pass legislation dealing with aliens such as has not been passed in any other country. I hope we shall agree to the amendment, in order that we may lay it down as a principle that it is our duty to protect the consumer as well as the Government. </para>

                    <para>- When I listened to the Minister's very earnest words, requesting the committee to go back on what they had already done, and not to do what they proposed to do, I was reminded that equally earnest words were addressed to him by various honorable members when the Customs Bill was before us. Then the Minister found a hundred reasons why we should provide for the purity of imported goods. It has been pointed out that, if we deal with this matter as proposed, we shall be treating our own productions differently from imported goods under the Customs Bill. In that Bill we actually, under the pressure of the Ministry, passed a clause which stated that an article which was allowed to be manufactured in this country would not be allowed to be imported into the Commonwealth, and on the 59th rule in this Bill, where the objection was raised that the Minister's proposal would have the effect of hampering trade, he insisted upon its being passed. Under that rule it will be necessary, in the case of spirits bottled within the Commonwealth, for the name of the distillery and the place where the spirits were distilled to appear on the casks and cases, although no such provision is made regarding imported spirits under the Customs Bill. The Minister refused to listen to the representations that trade would be unnecessarily hampered, or that we might be exceeding our powers under the Constitution. It was shown that all restrictions could be escaped by the payment of duty upon the spirits, and by then dealing with them in a free store, just as the provision now sought to be made can be escaped, because spirits can be taken into a free store and dealt with without any of the labelling that the honorable member for Echuca contemplates. </para>

There will be a good deal of lying in connexion with the declarations on the cases, and there will be twelve times as much lying in connexion with the labels on the bottles.

                    <para>- The position is that the spirit warehouse is a Customs bond, and the provision is to allow spirits to be taken out of the warehouse, where they are under lock and key, back into the spirit store for the purpose of blending. I do not think that any objection can be offered to that, but I cannot agree that such action ought to be left entirely to the discretion of the distiller. It would be highly undesirable that spirits should be taken out at airy moment without any consideration as to the presence of an officer. If the honorable member for South Australia is willing to accept the rule in the following form, I am prepared to meet him : - </para>

                        <para>- The only point is whether the distiller should have to apply in writing to the collector, and that the collector should then have the right to permit or refuse. It would be better, as suggested by the amendment, that the distiller should merely notify his desire, and should then have the right, under proper Customs supervision, to have these spirits returned to the store for revatting and blending purposes. </para>

                    <para>- I am afraid that twelve hours' notice will be too little. We do not want to harass the vigneron ; but at the same time we cannot be always there, and if twelve hours' notice only is to be required I am inclined to think that it will be difficult to exercise any supervision. Of course the circumstances are not the same as in Victoria at present. There are cases where distilleries are, or may be, situated in much more remote districts, and twelve hours' notice I am sure would place difficulties in the way of the presence of an officer which might not be altogether desirable. I ask the honorable member not to press for an amendment. Surely 24 hours' notice is not too stiff. </para>

                        <para>- I think that is permitted already, and I do not think the amendment is wanted, because I have already agreed not to limit the vigneron to the distillation of spirits to fortify his own wines. That was struck out just now for the purpose of getting over the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>-That will not meet the case at all. The Minister has struck out some words which restricted the use by a vigneron distiller of the spirits he distilled for his own wine, but he has not the power to sell the spirit ho distils, unless he gets special permission, and I do not know what use it is going to be to him to be told that he may make a present of it to somebody else. He has not the right of sale, but the spirits he distils may be used for some one else's wine. Under regulation 105 two or more vignerons may have' one still between them, provided they move it about, and all I want is to give them the power to use a still if they choose to keep it in one place. It will make no difference to the Customs department, as it will be subject to supervision. I only want to do away with the necessity for moving the still about, where that can be avoided. </para>
