                        <para>- I wish to ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-Genera!, when a decision is likely to be arrived at in regard to extending telegraph communication to Tarcoola? I ask the question because the work is urgent and because I believe the reports for which the Postmaster-General was waiting are in Melbourne. At the present time, when silver and lead mining is in a very depressed condition, the development of a new goldfield would be of great advantage to Australia. Yesterday the Minister of Mines at Adelaide received the following telegram from the Government official at Tarcoola : - </para>

                            <para>- I admit the court orders the letters to be opened ; but if the court ordered the Postmaster-General to stand on his head in the street, we should not be disposed to back up the court's action. We should direct the court to order only what is reasonable and fair between man and man, and I do not think the clause is a fair proposal. It is not right, because a man happens to be 'unable to pay his debts, that all his correspondence should be handed over to a perfect stranger. Is it right that the Postal department should be converted into a sort of detective agency? Surely when the Post-office was instituted to carry and deliver letters it was never understood that the department would be used to pry into a man's secrets. I doubt whether this clause can be justified, and even if it can be justified, I doubt whether it will succeed in doing what its framers intend. Is it to be supposed that if an insolvent's friends wish to help him to secrete some of his assets, they could not find other means than the </para>

                            <para>- I know thousands of people in my constituency who are in a position - I will not say to gamble, but to take up tickets in sweeps, and who do not wrong anybody by doing so. They are perfectly solvent, and have a perfect right to do so, and the honorable member has no right whatever to interfere with them. The excuse - I will not call it an answer- - is this : that a man's liberty is to be curtailed because other people abuse their liberty. Some few people steal, others get into debt or evade their just debts in order to procure means to get tickets in sweeps. And granting all this, the honorable member's contention is that therefore the majority who can afford the money, who like the excitement, and who hope to draw a prize - and do not let honorable members forget the fact that these affairs are conducted legitimately, and people go into them with a fair and honest expectation of winning a prize, and, it may be, a competency to last them for the rest of their days - the majority who can afford the money and are buoyed up with the hope of winning a prize are to be deprived of their just rights because some few people abuse their liberty. Let us see, where this argument is going to lead us. If every good thing abused by a minority is to be tabooed by the Legislature to the majority, I am afraid that we will arrive at a very unpleasant state of society. Take the case of stimulants : The primary right to gamble, Of a man who can afford to gamble, is on exactly the same plane as the right of a man, who can afford to pay for liquor, to get drunk. By the same logic with which we suppress gambling, we must also prohibit the use of liquor. I have heard some very liberal and democratic members of this House say that they are in favour of this clause, but, if we are to be logical, let us go to the logical end, and let us not try to put down gambling while we allow other evils, quite as injurious to the community, to flourish in our midst. If we attempt to put down gambling, we must, if we are consistent, proceed with legislation against other practices which we cannot put down. A temperance advocate, quoted by Mill, says - </para>

                            <para>- That is very clever on the part of the Prime Minister, but it does not meet my j&gt;oint. My contention is that facilities may at present exist for delivery of 26 mails per year at a certain place, but the growth of population in that place may shortly require a' daily mail. If a daily mail were granted then under this clause the Postmaster-General would require from the local governing body a certain sum to indemnify him against loss. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. That is just what I wish to point out. I have known a place to have a mail service once a week, and the growth of population within six months to have required a daily mail. It would be absurd to suppose that a daily service would pay in remote places, and under this clause the Postmaster-General would require the local governing body to come in and pay portion of the loss incurred in supplying that daily mail. I do not want to labour the point. I only wish to remind Ministers that they ought not to do anything which would make life in these places less tolerable than it is now. As the Bill is likely to be discussed largely in committee, I need only add at this stage that I approve of the proposal to impose a postage rate on newspapers. I think that provision will work out for the benefit of those newspapers that are doing their best to open up the country. At the present time in some of the States all newspapers are carried free. The metropolitan newspapers real) the greater benefit, and the local journals are undoubtedly handicapped. </para>

                        <para>- I would not undertake to say that. The probabilities are that somethking lias been spent. At any rate, a good deal of time has been expended in ob* tain ing reports from various officers of the Commonwealth as to which are the best systems under which certain work is done in the States. I have no objection to that. It is the proper thing to do. We cannot expect the Commonwealth Postmaster-General to begin the work of administering a huge system like the post-offices of Australia fully equipped, and naturally a considerable amount of exploratory work has had to be done in order to ascertain which methods were the best. </para>

                            <para>- There is a good deal to be said in favour of the honorable member's suggestion, but still the department has been taken over, and we could hardly expect the Postmaster-General to do much within five months. We cannot, therefore, fairly .criticise the attempts that have been made up to the present to bring about uniformity. There has been too short a time for results to follow. The only thing concerning which we can fairly offer criticism is as to the way the central staff has been constituted. Though I do not want to treat the subject in a parochial sense, it strikes me that it is somewhat unfortunate, at any rate, that all the best and most capable men to fill the high positions in the central executive of the department appear to have come from the same State as the Postmaster-General himself. I am quite sure that the Postmaster-General, in his own opinion, has made the best selections. I do not suggest for. a moment that the gentlemen who have been appointed are not the best men. What I say is that it is rather unfortunate for the administration of the department that all these men should have come from one State only, and should know only one set of conditions. It would have been better if the staff had had a little wider knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the various States. I should have preferred the Postmaster - General to see whether there were not persons capable of filling some of these positions in other States than Queensland, so that a knowledge of the conditions prevailing in various States would have obtained at the head - office. Every honorable member from Queensland will agree with me in that. We do not want the Post-office to be administered entirely in accordance with Queensland views any more than we want the Customs department to be administered entirely under the South Australian practice, and by those who are conversant only with South Australian methods. That, I think, goes without saying. 1 hope that in any future appointments some good men -fill be found in the other States, so that a general knowledge of the conditions prevailing throughout the Commonwealth may be at the disposal of the Postmaster-General. There is one thing upon which I wish to congratulate the Minister, and that is as to his decision not to have too much centralization in connexion with the Post-office. The postal arrangements come very near home, for they have a direct bearing on the daily life of the people, and I am glad to see that the Minister has decided that there shall be a Deputy Postmaster-General in each State to look after the details of postal arrangements in that State. It would be most injudicious, and lead to a lot of red-tape and delay in government, if minor details had to be brought all the way to the federal capital, wherever it may be situated, to be discussed - for instance, the details as to the erection of an additional postal pillar at Geraldton. I know there was a good deal of fear in the minds of many persons with reference to the amalgamation of these services. It was thought that there would be so much red tape used before anything could be done, that instead of leading to greater facilities being given to the people, it would tell against that object. The Bill provides for uniformity in a number of details of administration. There is to be a uniform charge for the carriage of newspapers, and I quite agree with the last speaker that that is desirable. I know that there are some honorable members who disagree with me, but the services rendered by the State to newspapers are such that they should be paid for. There is no public advantage in carrying newspapers free - at any rate, I do not think the advantage is sufficient to warrant our imposing the burden on the people generally. It was put by some honorable members that newspapers do a considerable amount of educational work and give a lot of information. </para>

                            <para>-Probably if I had read the reports in the two newspapers in order to ascertain whether there was a discrepancy, I. would possess some knowledge which I have not got just now. I support the proposal to make the tax on newspapers the same as it is in some of the States. I do not think we can. afford to be particularly liberal just now. We do not know what our circumstances will be ; we do not know what we can afford to do ; and, so long as some of the States have to bear the pretty heavy burden which they carry, we should place them in serious difficulties if we relieved them of the payments which they have been receiving for the carriage of newspapers. The honorable member in charge of the Bill stated in his speech that it was intended to abolish the system of franking letters. The honorable member for Parramatta in his very excellent speech, which I read with a great deal of pleasure, expressed the view that this business of trying to make the department pay - of debiting to other departments all the service rendered to them by the Post-office - was one with which he did not agree. Coming from a State in which this system of debiting against a department all work performed for it by other departments, and crediting it with all work done by it for other departments has obtained for many years, it seems to me somewhat strange that the practice, which of course is only a matter of bookkeeping, has not been adopted throughout the States, because it is certainly a more accurate method of keeping the public accounts. The Commonwealth ought to have credit for the work it performs for the States. The Post-office should stand by itself. </para>

                            <para>- The subsidy was charged against the Post-office, and the revenue received from the shore end of the cable was passed to its credit. South Australia has been able to show much better returns than some of the other States because of the system of bookkeeping adopted. Probably if some of the other. States had credited to their Postal departments the work done for other departments better returns would have been shown. The South Australian Postal department is a paying concern, but that is partially due, at any rate, to the fact to which I have referred. The honorable member for Parramatta made some reference to the work done by the Post-office in connexion with the development of the country, and I agree with him that it would be quite impossible in many cases to altogether separate the postal work from other services which are found of great advantage to the public in newly settled districts. If, where a coach is running to cany the mails and also to give facilities to travellers, we were to replace the coach by a bicycle or a man on horseback to carry the mails only, we should make a mistake, viewed from the point of view either of the interests of the Commonwealth, or the general interests of the public. Where, however, letters are carried by the Post-office for other departments, the Postal department should get the credit of it. </para>

                            <para>- New South Wales is not so far behind as I thought. Whilst the Bill will secure uniformity in many matters, it cannot be said that it holds out any hope that the public expectations with reference to the assimilation of telegraphic, telephone, and letter rates in the States will be realized. These rates at present vary very much in the different States. One of the great advantages which was mentioned as likely to follow the accomplishment of federation, and one which the general public ardently desired to have, was uniformity of rates throughout the States. Now we are told that there cannot even be InterState recognition of the stamps issued by the different States under present conditions. For instance, if a man in Albury purchases a dozen stamps from the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth, and crosses over to "Wodonga he will find that the stamps are useless. </para>

                            <para>- There is a good deal in the statement that we cannot very well fix the financial responsibilities that ought to lie upon the various States, so long as the bookkeeping clauses remain. Therefore if we introduced a uniform stamp, we should not be very much further forward, and the public would not be very much better off. Some administrative matters may be managed on a more uniform basis, but upon all those points regarding which the public are most concerned and which most appeal to them, we shall be about as we were. </para>

I am not going into the details of this Bill, because I think they can be discussed with more advantage in committee ; but I wish to refer to the difficulties that have cropped up in connexion with the cable services to Australia. Three of the States have agreed to guarantee a certain proportion of the loss, if any, incurred in connexion with the Pacific cable. </para>

All the cables should compete on equal terms, and the service which is the most efficient, should get the greatest public support. The Postmaster-General says that secret rebates might be adopted by the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, but I would point out that this is contrary to the international agreement. Such a thing cannot be done. Anything which is in the direction of creating unequal terms, and of giving one company the advantage as against another, would be a breach of the terms of the convention, and would lead to the non-recognition of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company in the comity of telegraph companies. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is talking nonsense. It was open to any one of the States to do the same thing, but none of the States did it. South Australia alone did it, with her small population, knowing she would have to face a tremendous loss. South Australia expended a sum of £570,000 on the work, and to this day the line is not paying, taking into account the whole amount expended. The honorable member interjected on one occasion that South Australia was making 20 per cent, profit on this line. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that they will show more consideration than the Government showed when the point was raised in another place. I ask that the public shall continue to enjoy the right which they have had hitherto - the right given to them by international convention - to send their messages on the line which suits them best. There should be no attempt to bolster up one cable company as against another. I can fairly claim that, if South Australia has to stand the loss consequent upon the establishment of a rival cable company, she should not, in addition, be compelled to share the loss on the Pacific cable. When the bookkeeping sections of the Constitution cease to have force, these difficulties will not occur, because the services will be properly amalgamated, and State interests will not conflict. I wish to draw the attention of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to clauses 96 and 136, and to several others, which speak of, and provide for, the protection of the " lines of the Postmaster-General." Surely it is not intended that the shore ends of the cable company's lines shall be left unprotected? I hope that in committee the Minister will not object to the omission of those words. </para>

I shall not discuss in detail the provisions of the Bill which relate to Tattersalls and other sweeps, because I think that the subject can be better discussed in committee ; but the position I intend to take up with regard to them is that we should leave matters, as much as possible, as they were before the Commonwealth took control of the Post and Telegraph departments of the States. We should all be glad to see the establishment of uniform penny postage, but I agree with the Postmaster-General that, until we know what our revenue and expenses will be, we cannot afford to go in for it. I believe that generally where the system has been adopted it has been found after a short time to pay, but I do not think that we can afford to take any risks just now. I think, however, that it would be well to reduce the rates for Inter-State telegrams. Two shillings is too much to pay for ten words between South Australia and Victoria. </para>

I know that I should send ten one-shilling telegrams to South Australia for every two-shilling telegram that I send now. I shall support the honorable member for West Sydney in his antagonism to the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers, because I believe in a white Australia ; and if the Government are sincere in the principles which they have professed, I think that we are entitled to their support in the matter, and I hope that we shall get it. </para>

                            <para>- I will. Nineteen hundred years ago it was considered blasphemy in Judea, for anyone to believe in the divinity of our Saviour; but in Australia, nowadays, it would be considered blasphemy for any one not to believe in the divinity of Christ. Therefore, this is a serious matter, and one which the House ought to deal with very carefully. Our forefathers fought for ages for the liberty we now possess, and let us not surrender it. On that point I am going to have something to say in committee. The question of State rights has been raised, and just for a moment I shall endeavour to deal with the question as I understand it. " State Bights," is the doctrine that every State is supreme within the limits of its own sphere of action, made so by the declared will of the people as expressed in the Constitution, and that will, appropriately manifested, as provided in the Constitution, may change that sphere of action. In the Commonwealth Constitution Act the powers of the Federal Government are distinctly specified. The rights of the States are also held under the State Constitutions, except those expressly specified in the Commonwealth Constitution. The rights of the Commonwealth were gained by each State surrendering some particular power that it possessed prior to the enactment of the Constitution, and the Commonwealth Constitution thus comprises these surrenders of power by each of the States. Tasmania possessed the power to prohibit the carrying of any letters by the Tasmanian Postal department which that State itself considered to be objectionable. The State of Tasmania surrendered these powers to create the Commonwealth, so that the Commonwealth is simply the child of the powers once possessed by the States, but now lost for ever by them and passed over to the Commonwealth. Each of these States did not federate for its own specific advancement, but for the advancement of all, and, therefore, no one State can now exercise the supreme powers possessed by all the States, except through the Commonwealth Government. The Commonwealth Government is the supreme power. The Commonwealth has all the elements and insignia of sovereignty, because it has the power to declare war in time of invasion; it has the power to negotiate for peace, it has the power to declare a Tariff ; and it has the power of national arbitration. The only thing given to the States is the power of a majority to stop an amendment of the Constitution. As the State of Tasmania once possessed the right to prevent any matter going through its post-office, then I have only one course left, and that is to endeavour to persuade the House to modify this clause. Why should we interfere with Tattersall - never mind whether he is good, bad, or indifferent - when the people of Tasmania say that they want him. At the same time, however, I am bound to vote for the retention of the clause, because it simply represents the power that Tasmania handed over to the Commonwealth in helping to create the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I do not agree with the point made as to the very small amount of work that has been done by the Postal department since it has been taken over by the Federal Government. That criticism is unreasonable. It is not fair to expect that the department could have done much in the way of new work since it has been taken over. There are six different States, the Postal department in each of which has been working on different lines both as regards administration and construction. Some of the departments have paid for their construction out of loan money, whilst others, such as Victoria, have paid for the whole of their construction out of revenue. There has been an enormous amount of work to do, and probably will be for a considerable time to come. Therefore, it is not fair to expect that the department should have initiated new work up to this time. I see that the method of fixing rates is being varied by this Bill from the present practice in Victoria. Hitherto in this State the rates for telegrams and letters have been fixed by Parliament, but under this Bill they are to be fixed by the Governor-General in Council. Probably the change is a wise one, as it will enable the department to modify the rates so as to wipe off the margin of debit and enable the department to be so carried on as to pay its own way. With regard to the clauses about which so much has been said, and around which there will be still more debate in the future - namely, as to Tattersall's sweeps and the opening of letters - it seems to me to be absolutely necessary that the Post-office department should have power to open letters, in order that it may return them where the intended receiver cannot be found. It is a proper power to give, and I have never known any complaint to be made as to its being abused by the Postal department in Victoria. As regards the clause forbidding gambling through the post, I think the Commonwealth is hound to follow the example of those States where this practice has been prohibited. One of the main duties of this House is to conserve public morality, wherever it can possibly do so. Gambling is immoral in its very essence. Therefore I have not the least doubt but that this House, when the numbers are up, will be found to be determined by a large majority to do what it can to promote public and private morality in Australia. I regret that the honorable member for Coolgardie saw fit to make some remarks derogatory to members representing Victoria. I am sure that when he sees the statements in print he will regret them. He criticised the Victorian members as being all mere puppets of the press. That was certainly a remark that ought not to have fallen from the honorable member. I know the members representing this State better than the honorable member for Coolgardie does, and I venture to say that his remark was unmerited, impertinent, and untrue. It is not true as to any one of the members from Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- That disarms my criticism, and I will say no more about it. I have only to add that I trust that as a result of work in this House we shall turn out a good postal measure that, while conserving the interests of Australia and making the department pay, will endeavour to give all the facilities that can be given to the dwellers in remote districts. I quite agree with the remarks of the honorable member for Coolgardie that we should give every facility that we can to those people who live in places far removed from the conveniences of the great centres. They are the pioneers of the country. We must extend to them all the privileges that can be given in reason, and not curtail privileges that they have at the present time. I think the honorable member forCoolgardie has rather misread clause 18. I do not think it is intended to operate in the way he supposes. In fact, the remarks of the Postmaster-General in the Senate made it very clear that it is intended to apply to cases where a district wants special privileges beyond what are given to other districts similarly situated. Where special privileges are wanted, power is taken so that there may be co-operation between the department and the people of the district, who are prepared to partly pay for what may be extended to them. </para>

The honorable member for Coolgardie reasoned that every man has a right to do as he likes with his own, and that so long as he does not use money which should be put to other purposes, he has a perfect right to gamble or do as he chooses with it.

                            <para>- Yes; and when I interjected during the speech of the honorable member for Cowper, it was this kind of office that I alluded to. The Government have no right to be a party to such conditions as I have depicted, and when the come to let mail contracts I hope that they will see that the officers and men on the ships, and the men who drive the mail coaches, are treated like human beings and not like dogs. I have no complaint to make specifically about ship-owners ; but I know that many men who drive mail coaches, especially on country lines, are sweated in the very worst form to the last degree. Some months ago I rode with a man who had been driving a mail cart for over eighteen months, for something like sixteen hours a day, without a day of rest or any holidays, and who received a miserable pittance. </para>

                        <para>- I quite recognise that this Bill does not need any long second reading speeches, and my remarks shall be as brief as possible. In the first place, as representing a constituency on the border, I am very greatly disappointed that the Ministry are not prepared to immediately issue a uniform postal stamp and arrange uniform rates for telegrams. These comprised one of the advantages, I venture to say, -that were offered to the people when they were asked to accept federation. The Ministry is supposed to be a very strong Ministry - a Ministry of ex-Premiers, and a Ministry of " all the talents " ; and yet they are not prepared to come down with any. proposals in the direction I have indicated. </para>

                            <para>- We are told that the bookkeeping clauses stand in the way ; but it is about time that we, as a Parliament, got tired of this cry. Some time ago we were told that we could not have old-age pensions for many years, simply because of the bookkeeping clauses ; and unless we speak on this matter in no uncertain voice I am afraid the Ministry will ride those clauses to the death. Whenever we ask the Ministry to do anything, no matter what, they tell us that the bookkeeping clauses prevent them offering any reform. Then, I should like to see clauses 26 and 27 altered by the time the Bill gets through committee. These clauses, as I read them, seem to provide that a newspaper, before it can be carried through the post as a newspaper, must have more reading matter than advertising matter. </para>

                            <para>- There is always some difficulty raised. The. honorable member would make an ideal Postmaster-General, because he would oppose all reforms. I should also like the postal authorities to make provision for the removal of men from Sydney, Bathurst, Melbourne, and other large centres of population to the country post offices, to allow country officers the advantage of spending part of their service in town. In New South Wales we used to be told that the authorities had no power to send people out into the distant districts ; but I think it is unfair that men should be kept all their lives out in the back country, while other men are allowed an uninterrupted term of service in the large towns. All should take turn about. In Prance I believe there is a committee of 26 persons, composed of Members of Parliament, business men, and representatives of various local bodies, to act as an advisory board to the Postmaster-General, and to bring under his notice reforms that are needed, or improvements that can be effected. Of course we could not expect anything so up-to-date as that out here, but' I think that if an improvement is suggested by a postal employe for the better working of the office, and it is adopted, a bonus should be given. In New South Wales, however, several postmasters have told me that they are not expected to think, and that suggestions which they have made, to the head office have brought them only snubs in return. Then, seeing that the Post office is so important an institution, I should like one of the best and ablest administrators in the Cabinet to be at the head of it. In New South Wales, the custom has been to give the portfolio of the Postmaster-General to either the weakest or the least experienced member of the Ministry </para>

                            <para>- No. At the time he was appointed he was an inexperienced Minister, but he proved a very capable administrator, and,, as a consequence, was afterwards transferred to the Department of Mines and Agriculture. If we had the best men obtainable at the head of the Post-office, and good feeling amongst the employes, we should have, instead of an institution bound round with red-tape, a service which would be a pride to the people of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- One .or two remarks have been made in regard to Tasmania which I think call for some notice on my part. I hope we are not going to pass the clauses which have been the subject of so much discussion because, as one honorable member put it last week, Tasmania has to be "brought into line" with the other States, or because, as the honorable member for Southern Melbourne put it to-night, Tasmania has to be brought " up to the level " of the other States. That would be exercising a power which I trust this Parliament does not intend to exert - of dealing with the internal affairs of any State. "We are going to pass these clauses to deal with acts which are committed by the citizens of this part of Australia. The gambling complained of is not done in Tasmania, where the balls are moved about, but in Australia, where the citizens choose to go to the Post-office and buy postal notes in order to remit money to Tatter-sail's. It is because I recognise that there is a general Australian sentiment, evinced by the legislation which has been passed in the several States, against the encouragement of gambling, or the use of the Post-office as a means of encouraging it, that I think we are right in taking up the inheritance which has been committed to us by the States. I mean the inheritance of continuing in this Bill the provisions which the States themselves have already embodied in their own laws. That is the reason why, although I come from Tasmania, I intend to vote for these clauses. The argument is put 'forth that if we pass these clauses we shall be interfering with State rights. I do not know that any remark need be offered upon that argument ; but when we hear it said that Tasmania is "coming into Une" with the other States, I reply that if the other States had come into line with Tasmania the proposals of this Bill would not have been needed, because the Tasmanian law provides for the prohibition of advertisements of lotteries. If a similar law existed in the other Australian States, the sweeps in question would not be known, and therefore there would be no need to prohibit matter going through the post concerning them. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I think the honorable member who has just resumed his seat has rather taken fright at some parts of the clauses in question. He used the term "Church lotteries," but, as far as I know, the Post-office is hardly ever used for such purposes. I am against any such means of making money on behalf of any church, and if I thought we could in any way prevent it, and it were necessary to do so, I should go with the honorable member in doing it. There are certain art unions, such as those of London and Edinburgh, which are legalized in England, and I presume the exception in this Bill is meant to' cover those cases. The other points in the Bill can be better dealt with in committee, and I content myself with making these few remarks in answer to the reflections which have been cast upon the State I represent. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see why we should be surprised at the absence of Ministers, because not once, but half-a-dozen times, attention has been drawn to the fact that when important Bills have been discussed, Ministers have not been here to listen to the debate. On the second reading of the Defence Bill, I pointed out that it was a pity that the Defence department had been taken over by the Commonwealth. It is also a pity that the Postal department has been taken over. What we are doing now is simply to provide for further taxation, especially for one or two of the States. It has been said that no economies can be effected, and that the advantages of unification cannot be secured, at present, on account of the bookkeeping clauses. To a certain extent Ministers are right in making that assertion ; but that is the very reason why the department ought not to have been taken over yet. I should like to know whether Ministers really intend dealing with the Tariff Bill this session, and what work they propose to put before the Senate when , the Tariff is engaging the attention of honorable members in this House ? We are now going on with a Bill that has already been considered by the Senate, and what is the Senate to have to discuss when this House is engaged upon the Tariff? </para>

                    <para>Mi-. CONROY. - I do not think that the House should have been called upon to discuss this Bill at the present time. The more one looks at the Bill, the more one is struck with the fact that at least one-half of its 153 clauses should be eliminated, for they have no place in a Bill regulating the postal and telegraph services of Australia. The greater part of them ought to be the subject of regulations. At the outset of our federal life we cannot be too careful in laying down as far as possible great principles, on which the various -services ought to be conducted. That is the rule on which we ought to act, not only in this Bill, but in all other measures. But one is quite struck with amazement at seeing the load of detail which has been put into this Bill. The pinpricks of federal legislation will be felt throughout Australia, but, unfortunately, its influence will be distributed over such a large area that we shall not be made sensible of the annoyances which arise from legislative previsions in the same manner as the members of a State Parliament would be. Any legislative mistakes are very much more easily remedied in a State Parliament than in a Federal Parliament. In the case of a State it is very much more easy to bring such mistakes under the notice of a Minister and the body or clique who are able to point out disadvantages are also able to take care that a remedy is applied as soon as possible. But the members of a Federal Parliament are much more difficult to be got at by the great mass of the people. </para>

                        <para>- It has been said by critics of this House that a great deal of time is wasted. Probably that statement is, to a certain extent, accurate, but the fault is really not the fault of the House. It arises from the peculiar circumstances of the business to be transacted during the first session. Even at the risk of wasting further time, I cannot allow such an important Bill to go into committee without expressing my views as to its general principles. Although I have been accused of being opposed to every measure submitted by the Government, I wish to say that in my view this Bill is one of the very best that could possibly have been introduced. It has defects, of course. People cannot always be got to agree upon matters of detail. The Bill is an admirably conceived one, which well meets the whole of the requirements of Australia. Although some improvements might have been included, it has been well prepared, and certainly deserves the best attention of this House. Considering that this is the first session of our national Parliament, I think that the Commonwealth committed an error in assuming control of the Post-office so soon. Many measures, such as this Bill and the Defence Bill, might very well have been left over till next' session, when we should have had more time to deal with them. Parliament would then have been able to deal with the Tariff, upon which so much attention is at present being focussed by the whole community. If the Government had devoted their attention to measures which were absolutely necessary, we might very well have allowed the Post-office to have been taken over by the Commonwealth next session. So far the discussion has chiefly turned upon the simple question of whether the Postmaster-General shall have power to open letters addressed to certain prescribed individuals. </para>

                            <para>- An honorable member says that we ought to " start at home." If the Commonwealth Parliament had the power of repressing gambling in this and the other States, I would be one to take advantage of that power ; but we have no such power. We are, however, passing a Postal Bill by which we may or may not carry the correspondence of " Tattersall " from one State to another, and, taking advantage of the opportunity, we ought to put our foot down. If we do so, there is every likelihood the States will follow our example and repress gambling in other directions. This institution is a curse to the country, and, if it is allowed to continue, we shall go from bad to worse, and other forms of gambling will be legalized in the little State, until Tasmania becomes the gambling hell of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt Tasmania could do it, and we ought to induce her not to do it as an example to the other States.. Unfortunately, Tattersall went to Tasmania when the finances of the State were in anything but a prosperous condition. The fact that by legalizing this Tattersall institution there they would get, as they expected, nearly £20,000 a year out of it was the fact, and none other, that induced the thing to be taken up by the people and adopted there. I say, no matter what the loss is ; even if the loss has to be borne by this Commonwealth, let us. pay it out of our own pockets and be done with it, and crush out this evil, or it will grow until we have a sort of Monte Carlo in the little island State. I hope honorable members will consider this matter very seriously, and that it will not be approached, as it has been in some instances, as though it were an invasion of people's private rights of correspondence. </para>

                            <para>- It is no such thing. The petition which was taken around Australia, and hawked about in every street of the leading cities, was a petition so worded as to trap the unwary, and it succeeded in trapping some very well educated men. It had in large red letters " To stop your letters being opened by the Postmaster-General," and of course unthinking people readily came forward to sign it, because they did not want their correspondence tampered with. It has been signed by hundreds and thousands of persons who little knew what they were signing for. I have sufficient confidence in the moral rectitude of the community as a whole to think that, had people generally known what they were signing the petition for, and had they known thoroughly the circumstances of the whole tiling, the signatures would not have been obtained. I was sorry to hear some one interject the other day that we ought not to receive one of those petitions. I hope the day will never come when this Parliament will refuse to receive any petition from a subject, but if this petition had been understood a very great many people who have signed it would never have done so. We have, therefore, no right to take the fact of this large number of signatures being obtained in favour of this petition as expressing the will or the wish of the people of this Commonwealth. I say the people of this Commonwealth want to be saved from this curse. It has been argued here to-night by one of the members from Western Australia that gambling under certain circumstances is not immoral. . I admit that if, for instance, I have£5 to lose which would not affect me one way or the other, whether I lose it or make a win in this way by it, it would be hard from a technical point of view to prove that it was morally wrong for me to risk it. But we cannot take any gambling transaction in that isolated way. In gambling we must deal with some one else, and in connexion with this particular institution we have a system of gambling in which numbers of people throughout Australia take part. Although I may be able to afford the loss, there may he many others entering into the gambling compact with me, for the prospect of gain, who are unable to afford the loss. We know the tendency which gambling has had in the past. Clerks investing money week by week and month by month in connexion with this institution have been led in many instances to resort to larceny and embezzlement, and it has produced as much misery as many other vices. Some honorable members say that, do what we will, people will gamble; the vice is inherent, and people will indulge it, and the only thing we can do is to regulate it. I say we must not begin to think that if the vice inherently exists we are bound to regulate it, and that that will alter its character * in any way. We might regulate the crime of burglary in some useful ways,but it would be the crime of burglary all the same. I think that it would be found if we proposed to regulate this tiling in any way, the effect of the regulation would be only to make it easier to indulge in the vice, and men would accept, as it were, the State guarantee at the back of it, and gamble on that account, when if it were left open to competition with the fear of being "sold," they would not do so. I hope that as this is the principal item of discussion in the Bill, the House will consider very seriously before it commits itself to countenance an institution which has done nothing but harm in our midst. We have to consider, further, that this is a great monopoly, and it is utterly opposed to our principles of democracy that a man should hold this monopoly. Although, as I have said before, the individual carrying on this institution as Tattersall is an upright man, the day will come when Tattersall will die, and the institution will be carried on by others who may not be so honest. The question sooner or later will arise of why we should prevent or prohibit others from having the same right to make hundreds of thousands of pounds as Tattersall has had. Then we shall have to look to consider whether gambling is to be a part of our daily transactions or not. The arguments used in favour of this institution, if carried out logically, would force us into adopting a State lottery system, under which the State would take the whole of the profits, and would properly regulate the gambling spirit of the people. I repeat that I have sufficient confidence in the intelligence and moral character of this community, to believe that the time is a very long way off when we shall adopt any system of State "ambling. </para>

                            <para>- When the people of the United States found that we were outdoing them, they went in for that special legislation ; but it is in Russia - where the public censor strikes out of every newspaper all that any one in authority takes the slightest exception to - that you will find examples of legislation of this kind, which we ought to regard as mean and improper. I should like honorable members to recognise that the provisions of the Bill are not confined to Tattersall's, but have so wide a range that, to be properly administered, the Postmaster-General should have at his back a high court to direct him. I presume that it will not be seriously contended that the Commonwealth Parliament has power to pass laws dealing with the domestic affairs of the States. The honorable member for South Sydney, with the logic of topsy-turvydom, said that Tasmania was interfering with the rights of the other States ; but it is quite the other way about. The Commonwealth is seeking to interfere with the State rights of Tasmania in many directions. Are we to put a stop to horseracing ? </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I have any special reason to love newspapers generally ; 1 have been too much abused by them. But I do see, and I have always seen, that to a large mass of the. people the daily or weekly newspaper is the one means by which they are brought into line with day to day history, and the one means also by which they may derive a certain amount of instruction and amusement. It is to a very large class of the country people-- the agriculturist, the miner, and others - pretty well all the literature that they are likely, to have within their reach, and I say let the utmost generosity be shown to these people in the matter of providing them with a healthy amount of newspapers - if newspapers can be called healthy. </para>

                        <para>.- It is not my intention to prolong the debate on the second reading of this Bill, because it appears to me that we shall be able to discuss the details in committee. To a very large extent most of the impassioned addresses which we have heard have been on the details of the measure. After listening to the right honorable member who has just sat down, and to one or two others who have preceded him, one would think that the only principle in the Bill is contained in the clause that gives the Postmaster-General a power to do certain things, which -he already possesses, so far as the greater part of the Commonwealth is concerned. I do not intend to deal with that phase of the question at present, because I believe it will be fought out, and fought out bitterly. when we come to that clause in committee. It seems to me, however, that there are 'One or two other matters in the Bill which are worthy of the attention of honorable members. When federation was accepted by the people of this country there was a prevailing opinion, in the State from which I come, at any rate, that it would mean uniform postage. I hope that when this Bill becomes law the wishes of the people will be realized ; because it does strike me as an anomaly that the people of Victoria and some other States may enjoy a cheap rate of postage, whilst people in other parts of the Commonwealth are charged double rates. It was said to-night by the honorable member for Echuca, that the Postal department should be worked on commercial lines. </para>

Something has been said in regard to the mistake made in taking over the Postal department. I have a distinct recollection of the honorable member who now leads the Opposition, when he was advocating federation, pointing out in an impassioned oration, that one of the savings that would be effected by federation was that there would be one Postmaster-General, and one postal system, inasmuch as the Postal department would be taken over1 at once. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and. learned member sneers at the payment of country postmasters. It would be more equitable to make some of the big newspapers contribute something towards the postal revenue, even if the money derived from that source should be expended in increasing the salaries of some of these unfortunate postal officials. I do not speak for my own electorate solely, because, as a rule in country electorates, postal officials are no better paid than they are in big centres of population. It would be a good thing if we provided in this Bill - it is provided in another way - that some of these postal officials who fill most responsible positions, and have to handle large sums of money, were to be paid a better wage. In big centres like Sydney, and probably Melbourne, persons join the postal department at an early age, and we find them coming to manhood and marrying on a salary of £60 or £70 a year. That is not as it should be. We had a great commotion in the House not very long ago when it was proposed that a certain minimum wage should be established, and it was pointed out that the Postal department could not afford the expenditure. Any department ought to be able to afford to pay, at any' rate, a living wage. The only way we can accomplish that object is by not being too strict in our ideas that the Postal department should be run as a commercial concern, that it should be self-supporting. But we .certainly should not allow some of those who receive the greatest services from the department to escape scot free while others have to pay, and pay heavily too, for every convenience which is afforded to them. </para>

If he had been present during the debate to-day, he would have learned that some of them received as little as £10 a year. When he was speaking of them, 1 thought that he would not object to such a low salary being raised. But I am sorry to learn, from the way in which he treated my interjection, that he thinks they are sufficiently well paid, and ought not to have their salaries increased. </para>

There is a provision in the Constitution Act giving the Commonwealth Parliament power to legislate in respect to post-offices and telegraphs within the Commonwealth, this power being concurrent with the power of legislation in the States ; but there is no provision that when the Commonwealth legislation comes into force the State Acts shall cease to have effect. There is a provision that when the Acts of the Commonwealth and the State on. the same subject conflict or are inconsistent, the laws of the Commonwealth shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. There was a wise object in making that provision, because it might well, happen that in the laws of the State there might be some useful legislation which might be omitted from the Commonwealth law, and which at the same time might prove very useful as a part of the Commonwealth law. Section 109 of the Constitution provides - </para>

                            <para>- Yes, the public inconvenience is admitted, and therefore this seems to us a right and proper course from the point of view of the public convenience, and it only remains to consider its validity. As far as the provisions are substituted provisions for those already in existence they are inconsistent with those already in existence, because the latter apply only to the respective States, whereas those which are substituted apply to the whole- Commonwealth. But there is the. further case of those provisions which are not found in the laws of the States, and which are entirely new, and the whole of the ground is therefore covered to meet both these cases. This may not be necessary perhaps in part, but it is not illegal to enact the repeal as to the whole of those provisions whose ground is covered, whether in respect of some of them there is or is not new ground -entered upon. I should not like to have any trouble about this very important point, and I do not propose that it should be settled at this stage. I think the proposal of the, right honorable the leader of the Opposition is a reasonable one, and if honorable members would like to further consider this matter, which involves a somewhat important constitutional point, I think it will be my duty to advise my honorable colleague to postpone the clause. </para>

                        <para>- The Prime Minister has taken a wise course in agreeing to defer the fuller consideration of this clause, because we ought to know where we stand in regard to these matters, and be careful as to what precedents we make. Section 52 sets forth that this Parliament has exclusive power to legislate in respect of the departments taken over, and according to section 69 "posts, telegraphs, and telephones " are transferred to the Commonwealth. It is very doubtful, to say the least -I rather think there is no power - whether the States can repeal their postal laws now. The exclusive legislative power, it seems to me, is in the Commonwealth, and it might be well to consider whether we should or should not assert our right to repeal those laws. This section is, in any case, of a different character to section 112. The annulment of inspection laws does not repeal ; it is merely a paramount power given to the Commonwealth to see that the constitutional right preserved to a State to guard its territory from disease and noxious importations shall not be used for a purpose never intended. This annulment is for a totally different purpose, and the Prime Minister is doing well to see that we do not forego or do not exceed any right we may have. </para>

                        <para>- I should like some information as to whether any effort has been made to secure, in the central office, officers who have some knowledge of the working of the postal and telegraph system in the several States. It is to be observed that the secretary to the Postmaster-General has been brought by the Postmaster-General - who is a Queenslander - down to the chief office of the Postal department. That gentleman may be the most able officer in the Commonwealth. I have no personal knowledge of him, and we will make the charitable assumption that he is absolutely the best man in the postal service of Australia, although he happens to have been in Brisbane. The next thing is that the theory of chances has been upset in a remarkable way. In a great department the officer next the Under-Secretary is practically an Under-Secretary in the absence, for instance, of the latter ; and it has also been the good fortune of the Queensland Minister, who is ignorant of all the other postal services in Australia, to have discovered that a junior officer in the Brisbane office is the best man in Australia to take second place in the chief office. I admit that the appointments cannot be altered now, but 1 want to proceed from this preamble to a matter of practical importance. I want to ascertain whether arrangements have been made by the Government to secure in the head office the presence of some officers, no doubt very properly in subordinate positions, who know something about the great post and telegraph services of New South "Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is impossible for a Minister, however able, accomplished, "and quick he may be, even if he work on the lines of inspiration, to have, or for his Brisbane officers to have, all this knowledge by intuition. It is of great importance to the satisfactory "working of tins department, which touches the business interests of the people in a most intimate way, that the Government should see that they have a thoroughly good officer from each of the States of Australia to advise the Postmaster-General. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to say, when the leader of the Opposition rose, that the Postmaster-General has been actuated by the very desire indicated by the right honorable gentleman, and has sought, from each of the States, officers who may be useful to him in his department. He has been for some time associated with the heads of the department in the various States, and by personal intercourse has been able to learn something of their calibre. Two officers from Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales, one from South Australia, and one from Tasmania, have already been engaged. The Postmaster-General finds himself in an awkward predicament now in having arranged with certain officers temporarily to reside in Victoria, because of what has taken place in the House in regard to allowances. This may interfere with the purpose he had in view of bringing from each State some officer having a knowledge of the practice existing in each State, which would make his services useful to the Commonwealth. However, the persons to whom the right honorable the leader of the Opposition has referred have already been appointed. </para>

                        <para>- It is already the practice in some of the States, and it works exceedingly .well. In the department in South Australia, we never send away a youth when he reaches the age of 21. Some scores of boys are absorbed by the department every year. The practice of dismissing boys when they reach the age of eighteen years, and are too old to learn any trade, is certainly wrong. </para>

                        <para>- The provision contained in this clause is an exceedingly wise one. Experience has shown in Victoria, at any rate, that in a large city, where an enormous number of telegraph messages have to be delivered, it is necessary to have boys for the- work. In Victoria, owing to the want of system, boys are taken on for this work and grow into manhood, but still retain their position as telegraph messengers, and are always waiting an opportunity for getting into the service in some surreptitious way. It seems to me that the honorable member for South Australia fell into an error in comparing the state of things which exist in Adelaide with that which prevails in larger cities. We must employ lads as messengers, and it is cruel to keep them on after they have reached the age of seventeen or eighteen. I should prefer to see the retiring age fixed at seventeen. We should then have smart boys going into the service of the department as messengers at thirteen years of age, and retiring at the end of three years. That period would lie quite long enough. It would enable the boys to obtain a certain amount of experience before it is too late for them to get into some other walk in life. At the same time the department would no doubt mark out the best of them, and gradually absorb them into the service. The honorable member for South Australia says the service should be so regulated that we would not take on more boys than we could absorb. That cannot be done. </para>

I know a number of instances in Victoria where young men have been rendered useless for any other occupation by this system. The time has gone by for them to learn other trades, or to gain other opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of commercial life. They are really hangers-on in the public service, waiting for an opportunity to gain admission to the permanent -service, and spoiling themselves by remaining as messengers, and not being properly paid. I would urge that the retiring age be sixteen instead of eighteen. That would enable the lads to leave the service in time to acquire knowledge in commercial or manufacturing pursuits.

                            <para>- The proviso is that nothing in the sub-clause shall be taken to prevent the employment of boys above the age of thirteen years to be message boys or junior messengers. I recollect the provisions of the clause because it was at my suggestion that "appointment " was altered to "employment." If a boy is only " employed " there is no need for this clause, because the department can retire him at any age it thinks fit. I suggest that the age of sixteen is unwise, both' in the interests of the messengers themselves and of the department. I recollect that the idea of the amending Victorian Postal Act was that lads employed as telegraph messengers should have priority as to promotion to the grades immediately above them when vacancies arose. If the vacancies did not arise they had to retire at seventeen. I do not see any provision in the </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree that under the clause as it stands a manifest injustice may be done to a lad who, at the age of eighteen, still finds himself unpromoted, and who, because he has attained that age, must retire from the service. At first sight the best course to adopt would seem to be to allow the system -of appointments and promotions with regard to telegraph messengers to be left entirely to administration under regulations, not under a hide-bound clause in this Bill, which might work very unjustly. No doubt a very hard case might occur of a young fellow of eighteen, who had been employed as a messenger, being turned out on the world unfit to commence a new career by reason of his having sacrificed the earlier years of his life, when he might have been apprenticed to some trade. I hope we shall not allow that to be done, but that we shall consider the case of those persons who are very much at our mercy, and who should not be wronged by a clause in any Act of Parliament.

                        <para>- The best course would be to strike the clause out. If a lad has to be discharged at the age of eighteen he is turned out unfit to take to any other employment in life : but if the age is reduced to sixteen the boys employed at the age of fourteen would have only two years at messenger duty, which would be of no benefit to the boys and none to the State. Seeing that we have spent so much time on the Public Service Bill, where this matter ought properly to have been dealt with, the best course seems to be to strike out the clause. We are leaving to the Postmaster-General very large powers indeed, involving much more serious considerations than are here concerned. We might safely leave this matter also to the discretion of the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the committee will not listen to the proposition to omit the clause. Our experience iri Victoria leads -us to believe that it is absolutely necessary. In Victoria messengers stayed on until they reached the age of manhood, and although receiving a salary of only £60 per year, many of them married. Matters got to such a pitch that there was a surplus of 300 assistant telegraph operators. In 1897 it was found absolutely necessary to devise some means of preventing the department from being flooded with young fellows. I do not think that thirteen is too early an age to fix, and that age was fixed in the Victorian Act, because it is the statutory age at which a boy can leave school. Whether he has a certificate or not, he has to leave at that age, and to adopt a higher age would simply close an avenue of employment, which absorbs a great many youngsters who otherwise would have for a time to run about idle. The provision has worked extremely well. Very often the sons of widows have been put on. The department is extremely kind in that respect. We might accept the proposition to fix the age at 17, but we must certainly guard against overmanning the department, while insuring the employment of a sufficient number of lads to deliver the messages. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that there will be no attempt to strike out the clause. I conducted an investigation into the Victorian Post-office a few years ago, and the condition of things I found there was most deplorable. Several hundreds of young men who had grown up as messengers were receiving small pittances of £70 a year and many of them were married. They were doing work which was not worth £25 or £30 a year. Youngsters of fourteen can run messages better than any man can do. It was only on the report 1 made that the provision was put in the Victorian Act, and it has worked very- well. It is an intimation to a boy when he enters the service, and also to his parents, that he must not consider that he has any preemptive right to remain there unless there is an opening for him. If we do not adopt this provision it will lead either to largely overmanning the department or to miserably paying adults for doing boys' work. We should avoid both of these contingencies. I prefer to fix the age at seventeen, because it would give a boy an opportunity between the age of sixteen, when he can be appointed under the provisions of the Public Service Act, and the time of compulsory retirement. I know of many cases in Victoria where the elder son of a widow, when he got his certificate at the age of thirteen or fourteen got into the Post-office ,and when he reached the maximum age he retired, and generally his younger brother got his place. In the absence of such a provision there will be complaints of injustice. It will be very properly stated that the boys were led to believe, when they entered the service, that they would not be called on to retire, and that they could work their way up to higher branches. To do that in every case would certainly lead to largely overmanning the department, and failing that we should have adults drawing boys' wages for doing -boys' work. I hope that the clause will be retained, and that the age will be fixed at seventeen years. </para>

The Public Service Bill provides that boys shall not be appointed until they are sixteen.

That question will be looked into in relation to sub-clause (2) of clause 32 of the Public Service Bill; and I may report to the committee hereafter.

                        <para>. - With reference to the question which has been raised by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, I would point out that, notwithstanding the very bad nature of the facts, if they are as stated by him, there are many matters with which we have not yet the power to deal. This may be one of those matters in which honorable members may think that the Commonwealth has not enough power. But we have not yet exercised the right of legislating with regard to navigation and shipping, and until we do so legislate the State laws prevail. The State authorities have jurisdiction, and the State laws have been invoked. It would not do 'for the Commonwealth to intervene after the "State authorities have taken action, especially as we have neither machinery nor court to deal with such a case. 'This is a matter which may be more properly' left to the jurisdiction of the State authorities until subjects of this kind can be taken in 'hand by this Parliament, and legislation has been passed by us. </para>
