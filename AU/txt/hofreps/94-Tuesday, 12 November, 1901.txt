This proposal does not include any of those islands j but the Louisiade Islands, the D'Entrecasteaux Islands, and Woodlark Island are really part of the territory which was originally annexed. The proposal includes the whole possession of British New Guinea. As to the Solomon Islands, I am now in process of inquiry with reference to the method of administration, the expense, and so on ; and if the results of my inquiries are sufficiently satisfactory, it is quite 'likely I shall later on have a proposal to make in regard to those islands. </para>

                        <para>The estimate of revenue for the coming financial year amounts to £20,900, or £5,325 over that of the present year. The principal items in which an increase is expected are - Customs, £700; land sales, £1,660; gold-field receipts, £800 ; and the sales of the new issue of the postage stamps, £500.  </para>
                        <para>The only difficult items to estimate are the two relating to lands and surveys.

The Australians are practically on the spot, and they have unlimited command of capital. The Australian, living in a sub-tropical country, takes more kindly to tropical life and work than the native of the United Kingdom. Similarly the trade of Fiji is wholly with Australia; and although no doubt some parts of it is in goods from this country, or for export to this country, there is not, and probably never will be, any direct trade between the United Kingdom and Fiji. The distance is too great, and there is a sufficient market in Australia both to buy in and sell in. </para>

                        <para>The Commonwealth Government express the hope that the Secretary of State, before he finally refuses to ask the Imperial Parliament to contribute a sum towards the maintenance of the possession, may give his kind consideration to the difficulties of the Commonwealth in undertaking anything more than the minimum of necessary expenditure, owing to the incidence and pressure of section 87, 89, and 93 of the Constitution, which were inserted to prevent the finances of the States from suffering during the transition period. These, while they provide security to the revenues of the States, must greatly increase the caution of the Commonwealth in the undertaking of new enterprises which involve any considerable expenditure. </para>
                        <para>Although three of the States have borne the expense of the administration in equal proportions since the discontinuance Of the Imperial contribution, yet if that expense be now undertaken by the Commonwealth, it must be regarded as new, and not as transferred expenditure - it not having been incurred in connexion with any of the transferred departments. </para>
                        <para>The three States which formerly contributed are very anxious that the Commonwealth should relieve them of the burden they have hitherto borne ; but it appears to be difficult, under the Constitution, for the Commonwealth Government to undertake the administration of the possession, except as a territory of the Commonwealth.

                            <para>- It will have to be continued for a short while, but I shall come to that question in a few moments. The intention to move these resolutions has been communicated to the Imperial Government, with the statement that, from their willingness to give full control, expressed in former telegrams, we assume that this proposal will, if carried by this Parliament, lead to a consent on the part of His Majesty's Government. In the meantime, the Government of Queensland is bearing the whole responsibility. Drawing the memories of honorable members back to the position at the- 30th June, 1901, when the estimated deficit in the finances of the possession, then for three years deprived of assistance from the States, had become £10,000 instead of £7,000, I should mention that the three States agreed to bear that extra burden of £1,000 each, having already agreed to divide the liability of £7,000 between them, so that they paid ultimately £3,350 apiece. If not from the 30th July, at any rate from the 30th September, Queensland has, unaided, been guaranteeing the finances of the possession, and that is not a position in which any State should be left. There is, in addition to the other arguments I have used, a duty incumbent upon us to put an end to a position so anomalous as that in which the State of Queensland is left, by assuming responsibilities which can never be denied by us, for whatever we might do, we could do no more than delay. The telegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, which I am about to quote, was received on the 9th October. The Lieutenant-Governor of Queensland, no doubt with the advice of his Ministers, had made a suggestion that as the administration had not yet been taken over by the Commonwealth, the Imperial Government should consider whether they should not make New Guinea a Crown colony, and the telegram to which I allude says - </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter for the House to consider when we bring in a Bill. I am only saying that, as to the immediate future, I think it would perhaps be more desirable that the Tariff of New Guinea and that of the Commonwealth should not be interfered with on the immediate taking over of the possession. As to the position of the Commonwealth, section 92 of the Constitution, which has not its counterpart in the American Constitution, says - </para>

                            <para>- No; the circumstances are not quite the same. The Northern Territory is a part of the State of South Australia, and is defined in the Constitution in that way. The taking over of the Northern Territory as a territory of the Commonwealth, if it were done in this way, would raise precisely the same questions ; but whilst the questions might be the same the answers might be different, the territory being in one case on the mainland and in the other divided from the Commonwealth by the sea. </para>

                            <para>- I should like to know more about the policy of the United States in the matter before saying whether our policy would coincide with theirs. Whilst we may within a short period deal with the question whether there ought to be a Tariff between New Guinea and the Commonwealth, if the Constitution does not enforce free- trade at the time of the taking over of the territory, it is purely a question for us to decide how long we should maintain the present position, and when we should pass a law providing for the free interchange of products. I do not wish to bring about any complications in connexion with this matter. I think New Guinea should be taken over whether one result or the other is to happen. In view of the long centuries for which I hope New Guinea is to be a territory or, perhaps, a State of this Commonwealth, the question whether or not we are immediately to have a Tariff with New Guinea is one of the smallest considerations that should weigh with us. The honorable member for Wannon has referred to section 6 of the Constitution Act. That section provides - </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; over our part of New Guinea. If British New Guinea were to lapse into the same condition as the German or Dutch parts of New Guinea, then the position of the Commonwealth would be rendered more difficult, and much as we may lament the fact that we cannot have the whole of New Guinea brought under our control, that circumstance should not deter us from seeking to exercise control over that part of the island from which the proximate danger may arise. Both as to labour and the Tariff, future developments will be in the hands of this Parliament, if New Guinea is taken over as a territory, and I have every confidence in its determination. I am sure that this territory can be far better administered by this Commonwealth than by any other authority, knowing as we do that whatever advantage there may be in local knowledge is as much at the disposal of the Commonwealth as at the command of any other authority. Of course, if this motion is assented to, a Bill will be brought in later on to provide for the government of New Guinea. We cannot govern the country completely till then, but if this motion is assented to we can ask the Imperial Government to take such steps as will most speedily place the possession under the Commonwealth control. Until we have that control we cannot exercise full legislative power, but in the meantime we can ask for such power as will enable us to carry on the administration. Some reliance must be placed in the tact and judgment of those who are administering the Commonwealth at the time of the taking over of the possession, but there will be no long tax upon the patience of honorable members in that regard, because no Government would be likely to undertake the extreme responsibility of going on for years with the administration of a territory of this sort when it could take the far more salutary and wholesome course of consulting the wisdom of Parliament, and obtaining a proper charter for the Government of the territory. I hope I have not trespassed too much upon the time of honorable members. I know that long expositions of this character are not as deeply interesting as are many others, but one has to discharge a high function, one of great responsibility, in bringing a matter of this kind before the House; and I hope that honorable members will at least give me credit for haying endeavoured to make a clear statement such as ought to assure them of what is our duty in this affair. </para>

We have read a good deal in the public prints to the effect that Ministers have been busily engaged in considering, up till a late hour at night, certain amendments which they intended to make in the Tariff. It would be a great help to the committee - and it is information to which the public is entitled - if the Government would take the country into their confidence as to the alterations which they intend to propose. </para>

I am only sorry that I have not yet received any suggestions from the right honorable and learned member. I hope that he will repair the omission at the earliest possible moment. I suppose, however, that he will make his suggestions here, when it is less convenient to consider them. The Government have given consideration to a number of suggestions, and are still considering some of the others. They will not fail to acquaint the' committee at the earliest possible date with their position. But as to the item of stimulants, with which we are now dealing, the Government do not propose to make any alteration. </para>

                        <para>- Before we attempt to consider the Tariff in detail, it would, I think, be wise to have a statement made by the Government regarding their position in relation to the payment of refunds. In some of the States it has been the custom to allow refunds or rebates on account of any alteration made in the Tariff during its progress in Parliament. I hold very strongly that it is simply robbing the country of money to make refunds to merchants. I trust that the Government will take a course which will secure the protection of the revenue. I hope that they will regard the Tariff now before the committee as the Tariff of the Commonwealth during the time it is under discussion in Parliament. It is necessary and desirable that every one should be told exactly what the Tariff is, and whether there are to be refunds or not. It is almost certain that reductions will be made in committee, and for that reason I respectfully ask the members of the Government what course they propose adopting. As far as I am concerned, I hope that they will retain every penny which is collected for the Commonwealth up to the time when the enactment of the new Tariff is actually made. </para>

                            <para>- The importer does everything he can to put the payment of duty upon other people's shoulders. Sometimes he is successful ; sometimes he is not. The Government are not proposing at the present moment to make anything in the shape of refunds. Of course, when the Bill embracing the Tariff comes before honorable members, the question can be considered, but I take it that the idea will be that the duties will be fixed to be paid from a certain date, and that if any alteration is made that alteration will take effect from the date of the alteration, and will have no relation to the original duty. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any one in real life believes it. But now we are getting Ministers into real life, and I gladly welcome them into that atmosphere. There is one case which the Government will have to consider, and that is where the importer is in possession of the goods on which the duty has been paid, but has not sold them. Suppose the importer has paid £1,000 on a certain shipment, and still has those goods in his store. Suppose, then, that the duty is reduced 50 per cent. Surely, then, it would not be fair to compel that importer to pay the higher duty, and to compete in the market with other persons who have obtained similar goods at a rate of duty 50 per cent. lower. </para>

                            <para>- It is a case we have to consider. I entirely agree with the Minister, however, that where goods have gone into consumption, it would merely be giving a premium to persons who have not paid the duty to grant refunds. But where the higher duty has been paid by the original importer, and the goods are not sold, they will have to enter into competition with goods upon which perhaps 50 per cent. lower duty has been paid. That is a matter which ought to be considered. </para>

                        <para>- Did I understand the Minister for Trade and Customs to intimate that if a merchant pays £1,000 in duty on an article, and does not sell it, and the duty is afterwards reduced, he is not to get any rebate ? The article may come into competition with goods imported by a man who has paid a lower duty. The goods, as pointed out by the leader of the Opposition, may be laying in amerchant's store after the duty has been paid upon them. If some honorable members had only a homoeopathic dose of intimacy with commerce and the importation and sale of goods, they would see the necessity for the payment of such a rebate. A merchant who may have paid £1,000 in duty may not have sold a pennyworth of the goods, and another merchant may have paid only 50 per cent. of the duty. Is there to be no refund in such a case ? I should also like to know whether honorable members can move increases as well as reductions of duties? What will be the position in respect of any increases that may be proposed by an honorable member ? </para>

                    <para>Mr.FISHER. - That is the whole crux of the question. If a merchant is holding goods, on which he has paid a higher duty than that which may be imposed next week, it is very likely, if he happens to be in a sister State, where there is free-trade, that he raised prices from the moment the Tariff was imposed and practically collected the duties from the people for his own advantage. If a merchant gets an advantage from a Tariff as introduced, surely he should not grumble at any disadvantage he may experience under an alteration. He ought to have not only the commercial morality, but the commercial backbone to take the risks common to business transactions. </para>

                        <para>- As to commerce and the method of conducting it, there is a good deal to be said for the contention that duties refunded to an importer cannot reach the consumer. Tradespeople look after themselves, whether they be importers, or whether in the wholesale or retail business. Their contracts are usually so worded that they are safeguarded in the event of any concessions being made in the duties ; but I admit that the retailer cannot pass on concessions to the multiplicity of small buyers who may have purchased his goods during the operation of the temporary Tariff. No doubt in any proposal the Minister may make, he will keep this fact in view and make some fair arrangement. There is some truth in the remark that a merchant may have obtained an advantage in regard to any portion of goods he may have sold, and strong objection has been raised to merchants advancing prices on the introduction of a Tariff; but the merchant has no option. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ; and if the Minister wants to do justice he will have to remember that fact in any proposal he makes. Is it right that a man should pay £1,000 duty on plant if that duty is afterwards removed ? Is an industry to be taxed to that extent, when other industries in connexion with which importations were made immediately before the Tariff was imposed, or immediately after the duty is removed, are not taxed ? If it is a permanent tax, then the industries must take their chance ; but if it be temporary, consideration should be given to cases of the kind to which I refer. </para>

                            <para>- In reply to the question of the honorable and learned member for Brisbane, I would say that this is not a "cast-iron" Tariff. The idea of the Government is that in matters of this sort it would not be fair to endeavour to tie the hands of the committee. There are, of course, questions in regard to the matter of order, but subject to that, our intention is to facilitate the taking of the opinion of the committee on questions not involving too great a principle, and to give effect to that opinion. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that honorable members are losing sight of the whole point with regard to the principle of refunds. The act that we are practically doing now in collecting this Tariff is illegal. When such a thing is done, it is understood in most Parliaments that the operation of the Tariff is entirely tentative, subject to an Act of Parliament embodying the impositions. It is as a rule understood that if the duty which is ultimately levied - that is to say, the duty which ultimately gets parliamentary sanction - is less, there must in justice be a refund to the individuals who have paid the higher duty. It is not a question as to whether the importer may have parted with goods or not ; it is a matter of good faith and justice on the part of the Parliament of a country. </para>

                            <para>- That is another question. Nobody can tell to what extent a man may have sold old goods or new goods. The whole question is one of public justice and right. Certainly, putting aside these cases, no doubt great hardship will be inflicted in relation to plant and machinery which have been purchased direct for certain industrial purposes, and in regard to which I trust the duty will be so very largely reduced - if it is not done away with altogether by this committee - that it will mean the difference between great financial difficulties and prosperity. Then again, if we attempt to say at this moment - and the Ministry do not seem to know what to say upon the point - that there will be no refund in any circumstances, we paralyze, practically, the whole importation of States such as Western Australia. Surely we may look to the good faith of the Government in dealing with a question of this kind ? Everything in trade depends upon certainty, and the Government should say now what they intend to do. We have a right to expect a clear statement to the people of Australia as to whether these duties are to be refunded. It seems to me to be childish to speak of taking matters of this kind into consideration, more especially when it is a matter which rests on right and equity. I would appeal to the Minister for Trade and Customs to show us a little of that independent backbone which he is supposed to possess in contradistinction from some of his colleagues, and to tell us exactly on his own account what he intends to do. We know very well that whatever he says shall be done has to be done ultimately, and why should he go through the farce of consulting his colleagues between now and tomorrow in order to let the country know his decision upon such a matter. The Minister ought to consider this question at once, and let the committee know the course which he intends to adopt. On a previous occasion, to which he has referred, he went to the extent of saying that this matter would be decided when the Tariff came up for consideration. We have been waiting some time, and I know that as a matter of fact, there is a great deal of delay in trade and annoyance in connexion with this question. The feeling of irritation is more strongly felt in some States than in others, and we have a right to insist upon a clear statement now on the part of the Government as to the policy they intend to pursue. </para>

                        <para>- It is true, as the honorable member for Wentworth has said, that this is a matter of right and justice, but whether right and justice will be gained best by following what has been the practice, is a matter which this Parliament, and not the Minister alone, will have to decide. I can scarcely understand the honorable member's contention that it is within the power of the Minister to decide, on his own motion, that moneys collected for the Commonwealth should be returned. Surely, that is a matter for Parliament to determine? I do not know that we are in a position to decide it. </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable and learned member mean to contend that the hundreds and thousands of pounds which have been collected through the Customs under this Tariff are within the disposition of the Minister for Trade and Customs ? Such a contention is absurd. As a matter of common sense the moneys must be disposed of as this Parliament shall order. What has been said already upon this question shows that it needs a great deal of consideration. The duties which have been paid on articles thai have entered into general consumption should not be refunded, because they have been paid by the people of the Commonwealth, and the moneys which they have yielded belong to the people of the Commonwealth. As to duties upon goods in the hands of the original importers, or upon articles such as machinery imported for special purposes, wherever justice can be done, the policy of Parliament should be to refund the duty. In other cases no refund should be made. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is because this is a maximum Tariff. Still, I suppose, honorable members are aware that a number of suggestions have been made in the direction of increasing the duties on particular items. I do not object to persons in business making known their views. Honorable members are in a position of great responsibility, but I have absolute confidence that every one of them will hold himself absolutely free from any kind of improper influence. I think there is no harm in receiving information at any time. People outside have a right to give us information, but if it is to be known that the Government, by some process of ascertaining the views of honorable members, are to decide whether they will increase the duty on a particular article above that submitted in their own Tariff, then the whole Tariff will be thrown into a double set of uncertainties. Surely it ought to be understood when the Government submit a Tariff, that while reductions may be made there can be no increases proposed upon duties which are not intended for revenue purposes, but which are intended to promote the interests of certain individuals ? As things stand, I do not know that I can quote the duties upon spirits and narcotics, because they are very high, and I am not sure that we could make them any higher, without possible injury to the public revenue. But supposing that the duty was 10s. or lis. per gallon on spirits, I should be prepared to admit that there would be no sort of impropriety, if the Government, after the Tariff was fully considered, found that their revenue anticipations were seriously interfered with, and came down with a fresh proposal to increase the duty. That would be ordinarily a revenue duty, but protection creeps in even here. We have now a protective incidence even in th*e case of the duties on spirits. However, the duties on spirits are so high that I am afraid it is impossible to add to them. I am not advocating that they should be increased, because I would rather see them lowered, but that is all by the way. It will only add to the annoyance ,of the Government themselves as well as to the annoyance of the committee, if it is thought that the Tariff is equally open to increase or reduction. We shall have a new outcry by people who want us to impose a different duty. We shall have trouble enough ; but there should be some certainty, and the public ought to be assured of the worst. We have the worst in this Tariff in my opinion, but we ought to have the satisfaction of knowing that at any rate, bad as they are, these proposals might be made better, but cannot be made worse. </para>

So far as I can judge of the rule, it is not competent for a member of a committee to propose an increase of a duty submitted in the Government proposals, though I quite admit that it may be competent for the Government to withdraw a proposal and bring down another. I think it is clear that whatever the Government may be able to do themselves, no private member can propose an increase upon a duty submitted by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- There would be a difference in that case, because there was an existing Tariff in Victoria preceding the proposal made at that time, and if an attempt to raise a particular duty in committee still left it lower than the duty on the existing Tariff, a set of circumstances would be created which would be entirely different from those existing at present. Here we have a Commonwealth in which we have had no previous Tariff proposals, and the argument which might have been used for such a course as is suggested by the honorable and learned member for Corio in connexion with the consideration of the Victorian Tariff would not prevail here. </para>

This is a Tariff for the whole of the six States, and it is to be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. No other Tariff was so before, and, therefore, this is the first Tariff. If the honorable member for Tasmania thinks it is the third, fourth, or the fifth Commonwealth Tariff I can understand his vote on a recent occasion.

                            <para>- That is the case I am dealing with. So long as it is understood that a private member cannot increase a duty which the Government have placed before the committee, it will clear away a lot of confusion and difficulties. I do not think there is any doubt upon the point, or that anyone will question it. I do not think the Government would accept a proposal for an increase of any duty coming from a private member, I mean upon this particular Tariff. They may bring down another proposal. They are quite at liberty to do that ; but I am speaking of these proposals, and so long as they are before the committee there can be no increases. I think there can be no increases at the instance of a private member, and on the same rule, I think there can be none at the instance of Ministers either. It is better that these things should be cleared up, because there is a great deal of misunderstanding outside. I believe that to allay the dissatisfaction outside' people have been told - " Oh, that will be all right. The duty is too low to suit you, but it can be increased in committee." That is, of course, altogether a delusion and a snare, and it ought to be clearly understood that as for the Government bringing down higher duties upon some sort of irregular way of finding out the opinion of members of the committee, that is a method of procedure which the Government will be very slow to adopt. They will be very slow to use this engine of taxation in that way. It is a very serious responsibility, and I hope that the public will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that while the proposals submitted by the Government may be modified by the reduction of some of the burdens proposed, at any rate those burdens will not be increased. If they are increased, I feel sure it will be by another message. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot acquiesce in the proposition submitted by the leader of the Opposition, that a private member cannot propose an increase of a tax. I cannot say that I should be glad to support an increase of a tax any more than would any other honorable member. An increase of taxation would no doubt be an undesirable thing, but an occasion may arise where it may be necessary for a private member to submit for the consideration of the committee a proposition that there should be an increase of a duty. I certainly think that honorable members should not join in contracting or restricting their powers and privileges in this committee. There are only two authorities which regulate this question. I see nothing in the Constitution to restrict or limit the power of a private member to propose either a new tax or an increase of a tax. Section 56 deals with messages relating to appropriation of revenue. An honorable member could not propose an increase of expenditure in committee, because expenditure has to be recommended by a message from the Crown. That section is expressly confined to the spending of money after it has been raised, which is an entirely different question from the raising of revenue. I am aware that according to the previous practice of Parliament the power of members in matters of taxation was limited. I referred to this question at the beginning of the session, when the matter of standing orders was under consideration. I took the opportunity of expressing the hope that the standing orders would not be so designed as to restrict or cut down the powers or privileges of honorable members in matters of taxation. On referring to the standing orders, I find nothing to restrict the power of a private member in Committee of Ways and Means. There is one standing order, No. 171, which provides that - </para>

                            <para>- I take quite the contrary view, that unless permission is given under the Constitution, all the restrictions hitherto imposed by parliamentary government and by parliamentary authority continue in full force. Under section 56 I see no indication of any relaxing of the very stringent and very wise rules that have been in existence for so long. The Government take the whole responsibility, the whole of the odium if need be, and the whole of the kudos in connexion with the imposition of any taxation, and it cannot be left to individual honorable members to increase their proposals. It is practically contended that because certain reductions may be made which would involve a shortage in the revenue, it is therefore competent for an honorable member to propose that certain duties shall be increased so as to produce an amount which will cover the estimated shortage. There is no such power under our Constitution, and it was never intended that there should be. I have not had time to look up the reports of the debates in the convention, but I am sure that the honorable and learned member for Bendigo cannot point to any indication during those debates that the power of an individual member was to be extended in the way that he now contends.

                            <para>- Why not? A mining company the other day imported some machinery which they expected to arrive before the duties were imposed, but, as it happened, they found that under the Tariff, they had to pay £400 duty. The mining company have actually paid the duty; it cannot be passed on ; and, as it would be the easiest thing in the world to give a refund, it would be simple robbery not to do so. In such cases, I apprehend that the Supreme Court, or the Federal High Court when constituted, would have something to say, whatever Ministers might do in the exercise of their own sweet will. Numberless cases of the kind could be cited. I was told the other day of a member of this House, who, although professing to be a protectionist, has indulged in the luxury of importing an article of furniture for himself, and who found when the article arrived, that he had to pay duty. If that duty should happen ' to be remitted in committee I apprehend that honorable member will apply for his refund ; and he most assuredly ought to get it. I hope that the question whether a private member, with only his general responsibility, may move to increase the charges on the people of the country as a whole, will be decided in the negative, and that we shall preserve for all time the responsibility of the Ministry both as regards the imposition of charges on the people, and the expenditure of moneys so raised. </para>

                        <para>- The portions of the speech just delivered by the honorable member for Parramatta, in which he dealt with the question of refunds, call for serious consideration on the part of the committee. The expressions of opinion which the Minister for Trade and Customs has given from time to time, leave this question in a very doubtful position, and I do not think that the Minister himself realizes to what extent this may affect the commerce of Australia. The question is whether, if the duties which are ultimately adopted by the committee are less than those which have been temporarily imposed throughout the Commonwealth, the difference shall be refunded. The Minister, backed up, I think, by an observation from one honorable member of the labour party about the duty having been already passed on to the public, gave a very desultory answer to the question as to whether the Government contemplate refunding these amounts. I quite sympathize with the attitude taken up by the honorable and learned member for Brisbane, who urged that this question may involve very serious effects on commerce. The Minister for Trade and Customs pointed out to this House as far back as July last, the very great necessity there was for providing some means for shielding the Government against actions for having collected duties without the justification of an Act of. Parliament. The Minister then gave an assurance which I. do not hesitate to say every merchant in the Commonwealth not only relied on, but was justified in relying on. The honorable and learned member for Indi had just then addressed the committee, and the assurance was given by the Minister for Trade and Customs in reply. I ask the committee to listen to the words I am about to quote, because if the mercantile classes in Australia are justified in relying on an assurance given by a member of the Government, standing in his place in the House, then every merchant in Australia is justified in expecting a refund of the ultimate difference between the duties imposed and the duties collected in anticipation of the Tariff. On the 23rd July, in discussing the Customs Bill, the Minister for Trade and Customs said - </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the words were in relation to that clause, but the Minister for Trade and Customs made it perfectly clear to the House and to the mercantile classes of the Commonwealth, that whatever duties were imposed ultimately, would be the duties which everybody would have to pay, and that any difference which existed between the rates ultimately adopted in the Tariff and those adopted temporarily in order that the Government might not miss the opportunity of collecting duties, was to be refunded. I submit that when a Minister gives an assurance to so large and important a section of the community, that they may with confidence clear their goods from the Customhouse without fear of being placed at any disadvantage in relation to other mercantile people, when the Tariff is decided upon, we have a perfect right to see that that assurance is fulfilled with regard to every degree of good faith. One honorable member of the labour party appears to have jumped to the conclusion that in every case where the duties have been paid, the goods have been passed on to the public, and the duties paid by the latter. It has been pointed out with considerable force that a very large quantity of machinery which was not intended for re-sale has been purchased, that the duty has been paid upon it, and that it has been erected in connexion with different industries. Would the Minister for Trade and Customs say that, in the event of the duty being removed ultimately, the people engaged in these particular industries, who had paid the duty, should be placed at a disadvantage to the extent of some hundreds of pounds, because they had carried out their work in a prompt and businesslike way? It would be very unfair. There would be many other cases of injustice, in regard to which I might appeal to the honorable member for Melbourne to bear me out. There are cases in which merchants might clear their goods, not necessarily for immediate sale, but in order to have them in stock. If, for example, cottons were allowed to come in free, as proposed by the labour party, a softgoods merchant who had previously cleared from bond between £3,000 and £4,000 worth of cotton goods would find that his stock had cost him 15 per cent, more than that of his next-door neighbour, who had waited until the ultimate expression of opinion upon the Tariff had been made by Parliament. We should not visit upon these mercantile people who, accepting the Ministerial assurance, have cleared their goods on the higher duty, the consequences of their business aptitude and promptitude. I admit that it would be very unfair to make any refund to merchants in respect of a reduction of a duty on goods when the public themselves had paid that duty. I wish the Minister to exercise, if he will, a little more care in laying down the principle which is to guide him in future in dealing with these questions. I am sure that the mercantile classes in all the capitals of Australia will be somewhat surprised to hear that, after the expression of opinion made on the 23rd July by the Minister for Trade and Customs, he has now, in an off-hand manner, committed himself to the principle of retaining the whole of these duties. When, in July last, he made the statement to which I have referred, he appeared to regard the money paid in respect of these duties as belonging to a kind of suspense account, because he said - </para>

If the Ministry found that business of even less importance than this question of taxation was to be taken out of their hands, they would say, " If you do that, then our responsibilities cease, because we will not allow individual members to take the responsibilities which properly belong to us."

                            <para>- I have heard of legislative chambers in which there has been that limit, and I have heard the argument that we may propose increases up to the height of previously existing duties ; but, if that did apply in other cases, it cannot apply in this case, because although duties have existed in some of the States to a certain extent, in others those duties may not have existed at all. We are dealing with the Commonwealth as a whole, and are imposing new taxation under an entirely new Tariff, which has no relation whatever to any previously existing Tariff. I think the point has been properly raised, so that Ministers may have an opportunity of saying what they are going to do. Are they going to abandon responsibility ? Are they going to request those members who want increases in certain duties to place before them such representations as will induce Ministers themselves to raise the duties ? </para>

                            <para>- The Government can decide it in the most practical way possible by saying whether they will stand it. That is the way in which on many occasions they have to decide matters that do not come under the standing orders of Parliament at all. Matters of that kind have constantly to be decided, and it is simply a question of the attitude of the Government. The Minister for Customs proposes to fix these duties apparently in the same way that he is going to fix the duties upon whisky, only in the one case he gauges a cask, and in the other case he proposes to gauge Parliament, and when he has found out what duties honorable members desire to propose, he will be prepared to accept any proposal that he thinks has enough votes behind it. I think that the Government in handling such an important matter as the first Tariff of Australia, with all their responsibilities behind them, and with all the States' needs behind them, should look upon this as a matter which they and they alone should deal with, and, however strong the arguments, statements, and facts put before them may be, they should recognise that the responsibility must rest with them of accepting or rejecting proposals, and that they alone should move in matters of increases especially. </para>

                            <para>- That was the contention of another honorable member. If the honorable and learned member for Parkes will admit that it is only in instances where an affidavit is made by a merchant to the effect mentioned that a refund shall take place, I can turn to the statement made by the honorable member for Wentworth. That honorable member said it would be an injustice to the merchants, and that we had no power at all to retain any of the money, because this was not a legally enacted Tariff, but was only a privileged and tentative resolution. What I say is that if the duties under this Tariff are to be passed on to the people, and if honorable members are to be actuated by honest political principles, they will pass a Bill through Parliament which will safeguard the public interests, and keep the money extorted from the consumers for the public use. Surely honorable members will agree to that, and surely the honorable member for North Sydney would agree to it. </para>

We simply contended that, by way of security for the payment of the lower duty we are proposing, we should collect the higher duty, undertaking when the Federal Tariff was validated to refund the excess. That is all we proposed or thought of doing, and, under such circumstances, for an honorable member of the standing which the honorable and learned member for Parkes enjoys, to make such a suggestion as he has made, and hammer it home by repeating it, and to put it as if we were guilty of a breach of faith - words fail me to adequately describe what I think is the absolute iniquity of his conduct. </para>

What was intended to be done was, as soon as we had got the lower duty validated, to return the amount which we collected simply by way of security. The two cases are not parallel. As regards the words which the honorable member has used on the subject of this money being collected in trust, the impression which he put to honorable members was that the money was collected in trust for the importers. Nothing of the sort. </para>

                            <para>- Some time or other, yes. We feel, in connexion with the first Australian Tariff, that if ever there was a time when efforts should be made to secure the best thing possible under the circumstances, and the best information from all sources, this is the time. And we do not propose, if we can avoid it, to allow technical difficulties to obstruct salutary alterations. In that respect we differ from the other side. Their first proposition was to tie the hands of all. who want to alter in one direction - to prevent alterations emanating from those who have the chief right to be called the friends of the Government. We shall do our best to consult the public interest. We shall be delighted to receive information from all sides, and that which we believe to be a good thing for Australia we shall take the responsibility of adopting. We have taken a lot of trouble to turn the Tariff out as well as we possibly could ; but, at the same time, who, for a moment, would suggest that a conference with others could not be utilized for the benefit of all ? </para>

                            <para>- The reason probably rests on the same principle which Ministers have found so serviceable in connexion with the Estimates of Expenditure. Just think of what the position would be if private members were allowed to increase the amounts set down in the Estimates of Expenditure. We should soon arrive at an utterly chaotic state of affairs. We always start fair in Committee of Supply, and there is a certain mark beyond which members cannot go - that is the Estimates submitted by the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to prolong the discussion upon the technical constitutional question which has been raised, but I wish to point out to my honorable friends opposite that, while I thoroughly agree that it is desirable that we should continue this discussion in a statesmanlike and friendly manner, we are not likely to do that by imputing motives and by using such words as "robbery." That has been done two or three times during the course of this debate. The insinuation has been thrown out that protectionists and manufacturers are all robbers. </para>

                            <para>- It has been said half-a-dozen times, as our records will show. It is continually being said. If there is so much commercial immorality amongst manufacturers - and I refuse to admit it - there is quite as much amongst importers. All the robbery is not on one side. Surely honorable members opposite do not suppose that protectionists are entirely satisfied with the proposals of the Government. I have already said that there are duties in the Tariff which, if carried into effect, would close down a number of our industries. While I recognise that we cannot hope to get the Victorian Tariff, I intend to do my best to remove many anomalies that I believe will be detrimental to the interests of the manufacturing interests of Victoria. For that reason, to take up the position that the criticism of the Government proposals must all come from those who want reductions, and that no amendments must be moved by those who believe that there are items on the Tariff which, even under our changed circumstances, are not adequately protective, seems to me to be monstrous. It is a position which cannot be maintained. </para>

                        <para>- The fact remains that this quotation was used by the Minister in order to show that there were great authorities who could be quoted in favour of the course advocated by honorable members opposite, who, it is alleged, are desirous of increasing certain duties. The passage quoted by the Minister stated that in the course of the proceedings on the Tariff revision in South Australia, in 1870, an amendment to increase the duties on certain articles was proposed, and was permitted. For example, on the Treasurer moving that the item, chicory 2d., stand as printed, an amendment was put and carried that the duty should be 4d'. Now, </para>

                    <para>I have taken the opportunity of looking up the proceedings, and I find that it is true . that such a proposal was made ; but the fact is that no point of order was raised. The proposal to increase the duty got through evidently by some mistake, and without attention being called to it. But what does the same authority say upon another page, where the passage has been marked - I presume by the Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- No ; I am dealing simply with one or two points which have arisen during the discussion. I felt it my duty to refer at some length to the question of whether any private member should be allowed to propose increases in the duties submitted by the Government, because I was under the impression that Ministers were anxious to obtain some information on the point. The ruling given by a Speaker of such well-known ability as the right honorable and learned member for Hunter should receive some consideration from Ministers, and I thought it my duty to place it before honorable members. I do not desire to deal further with this point at the present time. When a proposal is made for increasing the duty on any particular article, it will be within the power of any honorable member to raise a point of order. I have addressed myself to the question to-night, because while honorable members of the Government deprecated the introduction of a discussion on this point, they put forward reasons why action of this kind should be adopted, and I thought it would be improper to allow that course to be followed without showing what I believed to be the other side. </para>

                            <para>- I do not want to deal with the question from that point of view ; I am discussing it only from the constitutional standpoint. The honorable and and learned member for Parkes, in common with' several other honorable members, has raised a point in regard to the making of refunds in cases where duties are reduced after they have been paid on the higher scale. It would be a very difficult thing in some cases to make refunds, but there may be many other cases in which refunds ought to be made. I have a case in my mind of a man who is engaged in an important industry in my own State, and who has a large quantity of machinery on the way out to Australia. Although he is a protectionist, he has made a strong appeal to me to endeavour to induce the Government to allow the machinery to come in free of duty. He states that the orders were given for it some months before the imposition of the duty. If Parliament sees fit, as I hope it will, to remove the duties from mining machinery, then it would be most unfair if those persons having paid the higher duty were not allowed a refund, while others who had ordered machinery which did not arrive until the decision of Parliament had been given were not called upon to pay anything. I know that in many cases it might be quite possible for the Government to arrange for a refund of the overcharge to the person entitled to it ; but it will be almost impossible to do that in the case of duties imposed on the necessaries of life. Several persons met me on Saturday, and one of them told me that he had just been down to a store and had had to pay 3s. 6d. per pair more for boots than he had to pay for them before this Tariff came into operation. These people had read the speeches of the protectionists and had been told that the foreigner was going to pay the duty, and they wanted to know where the foreigner was that they might get the money from him. One member of this House, who made a very strong speech some weeks ago, said that high protective duties were a great advantage to the people of the country, because the foreigner, and not the consumer of goods, had to pay them. I believe that honorable member only a few days ago had a sample of how it worked. He imported an article of machinery on which a duty of 12s. was charged, and a friend of his wanted to know if he was going to get the foreigner to pay the 12s. The honorable member could not find the foreigner, and had to pay it himself. A refund might be arranged in such a case as that, but it cannot be arranged in the case of thousands of people who are called upon under this iniquitous Tariff to pay 50 or 60 per cent. more than they previously had to pay for boots, shoes, and hats. The duties are being charged illegally at present, and though the House may, as I hope it will, make substantial reductions in the burdens imposed upon the people by the Government, I can quite see that when a duty has once been collected it will be a very difficult matter to arrange for a refund of it. This question affects every one in the Commonwealth, and particularly the residents in my own State, where I am glad to say that under our policy we have been free from these iniquities. The only time during which we were subject to such iniquities in New South Wales was when some of our honorable friends opposite were in power. But immediately the people had an opportunity of speaking at the ballot-box they relegated those gentlemen to private life, and as soon as our honorable friends opposite face the people they will be treated in the same way. </para>

I am not speaking for the purpose of stone-walling, and have no desire to do it ; but I feel very keenly upon this matter, because I have seen such distress brought about by the iniquitous policy of protection in New South Wales as to warrant me in taking a determined stand against these proposals of the Government. During the few weeks this Tariff has been in operation I have had further evidence of what will take place if the Government have their own way. We have had a great many disloyal speeches during this debate by honorable members who have been making little of the old country. I object to the remarks which have been made as to the condition of the old country, because there is no warrant for them. There is no country under the sun where the labouring classes are in such a flourishing condition as they are in England to-day. </para>

                    <para>The year 1900 was the culminating point of the upward movement of wages which began in 1896. Not only did the general level of wages in the United Kingdom stand higher at the end of 1900 than in any other year for which statistics exist, but the rate of increase during last year was unprecedented high. If we confine ourselves to the industries for which it is possible to obtain definite statistics, we find that no fewer than 1,112,684 work-people, or about one-seventh of the total number employed, received advances during the year amounting to no less than £212,000 per week, while only 23,010 sustained decreases to the unimportant amount of £2,800 per week. The net weekly rise of £209,000 compares with £91,000 in 1899, and £81,000 in 1898. </para>

                        <para>As in the two previous years by far the larger amount of the increase is accounted for by the rise of miners' wages, which rose on the average nearly 4s. 5d. per week in the course of the year, and accounted for £168,000 or 80 per cent. of the total weekly increase of wages. Taking into account the various dates at which the changes came into operation, it is estimated that the additional amount disbursed in wages during 1900, occasioned solely by the increase in wages recorded in this report, apart from any change in the number of the working population, was not lass than £6,000,00.0. </para>

Why should the Government bring down a policy which will ruin the miners? How can honorable members help the miners by taxing their boots and clothes and all the necessaries of life 1 My honorable and learned friend cannot show me one case where any miner in his electorate has been benefited by a protectionist policy. In 1892 he made a very able speech showing how a system of protection would ruin the mining industry </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to prolong this debate, but I would recommend the honorable and learned member for Indi to carefully read the speech to which I have referred. Taxation through the Customs doe3 not represent the amount which people are called upon to pay, but it enables the local manufacturer to raise the price of the article he produces. One large firm in New South Wales manufacture . 8,000 pairs of boots per week, and have always been able to undersell the imported article. They employ 300 persons in their factory, and pay them the highest wages. Yet the managing director informs me that they do not want any protection, and are able to compete with the outside world. I refer to McMurtrie and Co. </para>

                            <para>- I am very pleased to note that the young population of Victoria are beginning to see the fallacy of protection. This is evidenced by the fact that the free-traders recently faced a public meeting here in what was said to be the strongest protectionist centre in the Commonwealth. I shall leave those who were present to judge of the reception which was accorded to the leader of the Opposition, and to the resolution which was submitted condemnatory of the Tariff. What a contrast that meeting presented to the demonstration held by the protectionists, which was advertised and placarded everywhere. Although tickets for admission to that meeting were issued there were not enough people present to fill the hall. The Minister for Trade and Customs, for whose ability and strong personality I have the greatest admiration, was advertised to speak at another meeting, but could not secure an attendance at the outset of more than 50 persons. The number gradually increased to 150 or 200. Then, again, I believe that the Attorney-General, who is a popular orator in Victoria, was advertised to speak at another meeting, which no ' one attended. The promoters stopped until nine o'clock. There was a rising of the people ! </para>

                            <para>- What I said was that the statement was incorrect. On that particular evening when the honorable member commenced his speech, I myself went into the corner, and asked three members in succession to speak. Yet a newspaper in this city, merely drawing an inference from my movement to that corner, stated as a fact that I was endeavouring to prevent honorable members from speaking. That statement was absolutely incorrect. I went over to ask three members to speak, but they told me that they were not prepared to speak that evening. They said "We will speak if the Government want to fill up time, but we have not brought our notes with us, not having expected to be called upon to-night ; this debate is going to be a long one, and we prefer to speak later on." I said " I do not wish any honorable member to speak if he is not prepared, but I wish that some honorable member would follow the honorable member who is now speaking." There never was any attempt to close that debate, nor was there any expectation of it being closed then. </para>

I have no desire whatever to curtail the privileges of honorable members, either real or acquired. It has been a matter of practice at all times upon a Tariff debate or upon the Estimates to allow a general discussion on the first item. We have not yet reached the first item, but axe discussing the Tariff as a whole. I am sure, however, that some of the remarks made during the last hour or so have been outside the resolution as a whole, and I will ask the honorable member to deal with the items. </para>

                            <para>- I shall be glad to be corrected if the Chairman thinks I am out of order. I was drawn away by an interjection, and sat down to allow the Attorney-General an opportunity of explaining. I do not wish to say anything unfair, but I will not allow anybody to curtail my rights as a member. I did not rise with any intention of " stone- walling," but merely for the purpose of rebutting arguments that have been advanced by the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer with regard to the power of a private member to move any increase of duties. When honorable members question the accuracy of my statements I am prepared to take my own part, and place before the committee arguments which I think substantiate my position. As there will be many opportunities for honorable members to place their views before the committee I shall not at this stage take up any further time. But I make no apology to the Minister for Trade and Customs for any of the remarks I have made. The right honorable gentleman has been very insulting to-night ; he will have many opportunities, before this debate is over, of repeating his conduct, and (he need not be surprised if it is resented. I have always treated the right honorable member with courtesy, and I expect in return to receive that courtesy to which I am entitled. I have done my duty in directing attention to the point of order, and also to some of the iniquities of the ' proposed Tariff. </para>

                        <para>- I do not rise at the present moment to take part in the general discussion, but for the purpose of referring to a matter that has been forced upon me by some honorable members on the other side. I entirely acquit the honorable member for Macquarie and several of my honorable friends of the Opposition, of any intention to misrepresent me, but after -what I shall say to-night, they will have no possible excuse. During my election campaign there was distributed a circular, from which some of my honorable friends, including the honorable member for' Robertson, have quoted. It is not unnatural that they should trust to the accuracy of documents supplied by their friends who, to a large extent, furnish them with the bullets which they fire off. But it is unfair to represent the speech made by me as a member of the Victorian Parliament in 1892, as a freetrade speech. </para>

                            <para>- I have selected passages which show that I was advocating protection, not prohibition; that I was protesting against monopoly, and that I was taking up the stand then that I took up the other night, and which I take up now, that those who advocate prohibition advocate monopoly. I said, I objected to it from that standpoint, and that those who, like my friends opposite, advocated absolute free-trade, advocated a monopoly to which I equally objected. </para>

                            <para>- We were told by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, also by way of interjection, to which no one took exception as being offensive, that this is a very different Tariff from that which the honorable and learned member for Indi tried to cut down. What must that Tariff have been if this is moderate compared with it ? I have already cited items, the duties upon which average from 45 to 50 per cent. In connexion with men's hats, a subject about which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports should know something, I find that the duty upon hats, which are sold retail at 7s. 6d., amounts to about 40 per cent. </para>

He was not at all surprised that members representing some constituencies had supported the duties, but he was surprised - and the fact must be extremely disheartening to several constituencies in the country - to find honorable members who were sent there to support the country constituencies, and to resist the imposition of those duties which pressed so heavily upon them, helping to carry those prohibitive duties through. He could not help expressing his sincere sorrow that this should be the case. The country was getting heartily and thoroughly sick of seeing this juggernaut of taxation rolling on and claiming its victims all over the colony. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that when the discussion was started this afternoon, it was confined to two points. The first point was whether the Ministry intended in the case of a duty being lowered considerably to make any refund. We desire to get a statement on that point, so as to satisfy business men. It is very much better for business men to have certainty than uncertainty. It will be no satisfaction to them for the Minister to say, "We shall not answer the question just now, because we shall be able to deal with it later on." If the Minister could assign any reasons_ why it should be deferred it would receive considerable attention. The only reason which can be assigned is that whenever you have anything to do which is disagreeable, or which presents a little difficulty, you should if you can put it off till to-morrow. I hope that the Minister will try to come to some determination, and announce it to the committee I do not think that in every case the Government ought to return the duty. In many cases the goods wil have been consumed, and it will be impossible to find out the particular person who has paid the duty. Business men demand that when it can be shown that the duty-paid goods are still within their control, a refund of the duty should be made to them. It would be far better for the Ministry to say straight out either that they will refund the duty in such a case or that they will not. While there is hesitation and doubt considerable confusion must arise, so that the sooner the question is dealt with the better it will be for all concerned. If the Ministry do receive suggestions from the Opposition - and of course one cannot hope that they will pay to them that attention which they always deserve </para>

                            <para>- We hope that the interests of such a large body of men will be considered. When any form of taxation is proposed there is bound to be a certain amount of difficulty, but that can be got over to a large extent by a definite announcement of policy on the part of the Ministry. This is not my representation alone, but that of various business men throughout the community. The other point in the discussion has been whether an honorable member has a right to propose an additional duty or an increase of a duty. So far as I can see the Ministry have abandoned one position. They have stated that there is no known instance of a duty having been imposed at the instance of a private member on articles in the free list. It would mean the destruction of responsible government if honorable members were allowed to propose increases of duties. We had the Minister for Trade and Customs getting up and saying, " You are doing away with half of the rights of members. Why should they be limited in any way ?" Their rights are no more limited in that respect than they are when dealing with expenditure proposals. Private members are not allowed in any circumstances to propose an increase in the expenditure attached to a particular office or department. The Ministry ought to be the very last to encourage the idea that private members can bring forward proposals for increases of duties. As far as the English Parliament is concerned, there are practically no instances of this having been done within recent times - nor would any Ministry deserve to exist for a single moment that acknowledged that there were men outside their own Cabinet who had the right to take upon themselves the control of matters so largely affecting the people. It has been urged that there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent private members from proposing increases of duties, but as has already been shown, the whole spirit of the Constitution and the whole practice of Parliament are entirely against such a course of procedure. The right to propose increases of taxation has been very zealously guarded throughout the whole history of parliamentary government, and nothing should be allowed to infringe upon that right now. If private members were permitted to propose increases of duties, we should have honorable members laid open to the suspicion of acting corruptly at the instance of certain manufacturers. </para>

                            <para>- The suspicion would not attach to honorable members who sought to reduce the duties in the same degree, because there is not the same inducement for importers as for manufacturers, to resort to corrupt practices to secure their own ends. Individual importers or combinations of importers cannot secure the advantage of a reduction of duties to themselves alone, but must share it with their neighbours. On the other hand, individual manufacturers or rings of manufacturers, owing to the special circumstances under which they are able to control production, derive the full benefit of an increase of duty upon the goods in which they are specially interested. Take the case of the local distiller who makes something like 400,000 gallons of spirit a year. The difference between the excise duty and the duty on imported spirit is 3s. per gallon, and that represents an advantage of £60,000 a year to the local manufacturer. If, however, as might reasonably be expected, the output of local spirit were increased to 1,000,000 gallons per annum, the difference between the excise and the import duty would represent an advantage to the distiller of £150,000, which would come entirety out of the pockets of the great mass of the people. I am told the money is still in the country, but that could also be said if 4s. and 5s. income tax were imposed, and yet, what a cry there would be. " What rights," the protectionists inquire, " have poor people except to bear the burden of taxation?" They will cheerfully consent to a duty of 4s. or 5s. in the £ being placed upon the great bulk of the articles which are consumed by the masses. Free-traders hold that every penny which is collected from the people, above what is absolutely necessary for the purposes of Government, represents an injury to the community, inasmuch as it lessens the amount of capital that can be employed in productive works. They insist that the whole of the revenue shall go into the Treasury, and that not one penny of it shall used for purposes other than those of administration. </para>

We saw that in connexion with half-a-dozen appointments. </para>

                            <para>- A very bad example has already been set, and I ask if the Ministry intend to. repeat that example. They will be doing great injury to the public if they allow the idea to go forth that it is possible for manufacturers to secure the imposition of increased duties upon any particular item by procuring the support of ten, twelve, or twenty honorable members. The people will demand a lot of explanation from any honorable member who dares to propose a tax which will increase their burdens. I am frequently astounded to hear honorable members declare that a Tariff which takes four shillings in the £1 out of a man's pocket is a revenue Tariff, whilst one which extracts ten shiliings in the £1 confers a great benefit upon him. I object to a class of manufacturers being singled out. </para>

                            <para>- To inform the people of the evils of this iniquitous Tariff is not "stonewalling." There is a ring of men who have their hands upon the throats of the people and who are trying to squeeze the life blood out of them. When the Government propose duties which are purely for the purposes of revenue they obtain a certain amount of support from this side of the chamber, but the moment they propose duties which have the effect of benefiting manufacturers we are opposed to them. We strongly oppose the difference between the excise and import duties on tobacco, which practically allow a sum of something like £200,000 a year to go into the pockets of the manufactures. Two of the worst points about this Tariff, in addition to those I mentioned in the previous debate, are the large amount of money that is going to be diverted from the Treasury into the pockets of individuals, and the heaviness of the duties upon articles consumed by the poorer people. In the case of the import and excise duties on beer, the difference in favour of the local manufacturer in New South Wales has been very considerably increased. The extra, money will go into the pockets of a few people. The amount is so large that we may well ask ourselves why such a proposal has been made. The Treasurer wants all the money that can well be - obtained. Honorable members require to ask and to ascertain why it is that in the case of the tobacco duties and the spirit duties, so large a sum is to be diverted from the Treasury to the pockets of private individuals. </para>

                        <para>- There are only two matters which were suggested in the earlier portion of the debate to which I wish to allude. One was as to the return of the duties collected by the Government in excess of the amount which will be collected under the Tariff as finally imposed by Parliament. I should like to ask the Government under what authority they propose to retain this excess ? As I understand it, the practice has hitherto been to retain the duties as collected if they are finally adopted, and that is done because the Act of Parliament, operating retrospectively, makes the collection not only constitutional as a matter of practice, but legal. But no Act of Parliament which we pass here as an outcome of the Tariff, can possibly, or will, ratify the collection of duties which are not finally adopted by Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Then what is the policy of the Government ? What I presume they propose to do is to collect, with a sort of retrospective validity, the duties finally imposed, and to justify the collection which has been made. But there may be duties in this Tariff which will not be finally imposed. The original Tariff of the State may have been 15 per cent. The amount collected by the Government may be 25 per cent., and the amount finally imposed may be 20 per cent., What the Government do is to validate the difference between the 15 per cent, and th© 20 per cent, by an Act of Parliament operating retrospectively, but they do not validate the difference between the 20 per cent, and! the 25 per cent. So that the collection has taken place as an Executive act, and the difference between the 20 per cent, and 25 per cent, is not validated by any Act of Parliament ; that is clear. </para>

                        <para>- A good deal of time has been wasted on this matter, and the debate from the beginning has been carried on in a very irregular way. If we are allowed to discuss in this way a question which has really never been before the Chair, it will lead only to a good deal of trouble in committee and in the House generally. In order to test the question, I move - </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>That the duty be increased by the sum of1s. In order to put myself right with the committee, it is well that I should give my reasons for moving in this direction. It seems to me that the discussion which has taken place this afternoon has had no result, and I propose this amendment merely to test the question of whether a private member has a right to move for an increase of duty. I do not think it would be a good thing that honorable members should have a right to move for the increase of any duty. If it is reasonable and logical that a private member should have a right to reduce an item in the Tariff as submitted by the Government, it is reasonable also that he should be able to propose increases. I believe, however, that any objection that could be taken to this Tariff should have been taken in the House before we got into committee. That is the course which ought to have been pursued. Having reached the committee stage, we should now deal with the items as laid down in the Tariff, instead of wandering round the subject as we have done this afternoon. I do not think it wise for honorable members who are not in an official position to take upon themselves the responsibility of increasing various items in the Tariff, because I think the Government should be responsible for the Tariff they bring down. They bring down a Tariff which they say will provide as much money as they require, and any attempt to increase their Tariff proposals is an attempt to go beyond what the Government think is a fair amount of taxation to impose upon the people. This is taking the whole matter of levying taxation out of the hands of the Government, who are responsible to the Crown, and placing it in the hands of members of the committee. Where is the thing likely to end, and what is the Tariff likely to be? Is it not likely to lead to a good deal of log-rolling? Members may say amongst themselves - "There are certain items that we want increased, and there are certain others that you would like decreased. If you vote for our proposals, we will vote for yours." By that means we should get into a state of chaos, instead of having the business conducted in a systematically business-like way. I think that private members ought not to be allowed to move increases in the Tariff. Though it has not been specially laid down in our standing orders that we should not be allowed to do it, I think that, outside Victoria, the practice followed is not to permit private members to move such increases. I can speak for Queensland in that respect. I admit that precedents may be quoted to show that upon some occasions the House of Commons followed this course, but it is not the general practice of the House of Commons, nor has the House of Commons looked upon it as a wise course to follow. Our standing orders being silent on the point, we are, under the first standing order, to have recourse to the English procedure and practice, and I think it should guide us to a large extent. There is not the slightest doubt that the spirit of Standing Order No. 121, quoted this afternoon by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, is distinctly that no private member should be allowed to move these increases, and that the right should be reserved to a Minister of the Crown, by some special mode of action. A number of honorable members seem to think this is a good course to follow because it appears to have been the rule in Victoria ; but I think it is an attempt to relieve the Government from a very awkward position, and I do not think it should be followed. I am not specially referring to the present Government, as if the present leader of the Opposition were on the Government side, and proposed to pursue the same course I should take exactly the same objection. I move the amendment I have suggested, merely to test the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection whatever to the honorable member testing the matter at this stage ; I think that it is highly desirable, but I want to see that his amendment shall not preclude a subsequent amendment for a reduction in the item. I desire to ask the Chairman whether, in the event of this amendment being defeated, it would be impossible subsequently to move for a reduction in the item. So long as it is clear that it will not prevent the committee from subsequently dealing with the item in that way, I go with the honorable member for Kennedy in getting the matter tested. </para>

                        <para>- I think the difficulty raised by the honorable member for North Sydney is avoided by the way in which the Chairman has stated the question, "That the duty be increased by the sum of one shilling." If that proposition is negatived, it will not prevent any honorable member from afterwards proposing to decrease the item in the Tariff. So long as there is no proposal " That the words proposed to be altered stand part of the Tariff" no difficulty will arise. If the amendment now proposed in the form in which it has been stated from the Chair is negatived, the only thing negatived will be the increase proposed, and nothing will have been affirmed except that the item shall not be increased by1s. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to ask the chairman's ruling as to whether the amendment moved by the honorable member for Kennedy is in order, and whether that question can be submitted to the committee. I ask for a ruling upon the point before we proceed with any further discussion. The matter is of the greatest importance, and I shall be quite prepared to take sides upon it when a decision is given. I. believe that under our standing order a question of the kind is submitted ultimately to the Speaker for his opinion. I suggest that we should now have the question definitely decided one way or the other, as it will facilitate the consideration of the Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- I was responsible for raising this point of order, but as debate has taken place on the matter, I do not think it is necessary to now speak at any length. The Crown has submitted a Tariff estimated to bring in a certain amount of revenue for the purpose of carrying on the government of the Commonwealth, and on the very first item, it is moved by a non-official member to increase the taxes on the people. I know of no precedent whatever for increasing the total amount asked for by the Crown ; and it must inevitably follow, if the increase be made, that the Crown will receive a larger amount, which must be extorted from the subjects of the Commonwealth. That, as a principle, is fatal to constitutional government ; and at the same time, without going into reasons, I think it is against the spirit and even the letter of own standing orders. </para>

                        <para>- Ordinarily, debate should not take place on a question of this kind, but I desired, as the question is of considerable importance, that I should hear both sides. I have heard both sides, and I should prefer, unless there is some very important and quite new point, to now give my decision. I am not prepared to allow any debate to take place at this stage on the question, unless the honorable member for Parramattadesires to state some new point ? </para>

                            <para>- That would be a discussion of the question, and if I allow the honorable member for Parramatta to discuss it, I should have to allow every other honorable member to do the same. I may say I have known for some four weeks past that this question would arise at some stage of the proceedings on the Tariff, and I have, therefore, given it very careful consideration. When first this was made known to me, I at once conceived that the idea of any unofficial member proposing an increase of an item of taxation asked for by the Crown was contrary to the spirit of parliamentary government, the spirit of parliamentary government being that the Crown asks for an impost to be made on the people, and the people's representatives in Parliament consider the request of the Crown, and may grant the request, or may grant a lesser amount, but would not conceivably give to the Crown a larger sum than the Crown asks should be imposed. When, however, I went from the question of the spirit of parliamentary government to the practice which has grown up as parliamentary institutions have developed, I am obliged to admit that in the House of Commons, which is the standard of our proceedings, where it is not otherwise set out in our standing orders, the practice of proposing imposts on items not suggested as subjects of taxation by the Crown, and of proposing increases on items which are suggested as subjects of taxation, has sprung up, and that on several occasions, without any objection being taken, new taxes have been proposed by unofficial members, and increases on details of new taxes suggested by the Government. </para>

I desire to further ask the right honorable gentleman, whether these are the same hours that Customs officials in other States are employed. </para>

There has been some little difficulty in assimilating the practice in the various States, but the rule which now obtains in one obtains in the other, the hours being fixed by regulation. </para>
