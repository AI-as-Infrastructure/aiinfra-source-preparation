                        <para>. -Some time ago questions were asked me concerning the appointment of a General Officer to command the forces of the Commonwealth, and I now wish to take the House into my confidence as far as possible, by saying that we anticipate to be able, within a few days, to announce to honorable members an appointment at the salary provided for in the Estimates. This is not the stage at which to mention names, or I should willingly do so. The mention of names just now might prejudice the negotiations which are in progress ; but I am happy to announce that there is an early prospect of the Government accepting the responsibility of making an appointment. </para>

                        <para>- Provision was made in the last Supply Bill for the carrying out of repairs and similar works, but, with regard to new works, it will be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to allow the State Governments to provide money for any of its purposes. I hope, however, to be able shortly to introduce a Bill to enable me to raise a certain amount of money by way of loan. I am endeavouring to finance really urgent cases out of the Treasurer's advance vote, but, as the amount is a small one, I could not undertake any large works. I hope when the Tariff is out of the way to submit proposals for expenditure upon new works, and an early date may be taken for introducing a Loan Bill. </para>

                    <para>- With the indulgence of the committee, I wish to make, before we proceed to deal further with the Tariff, a short statement "which may relieve some of the anxieties in the minds of the public. For some time past the Minister for Trade and Customs and myself have been considering the objections which have been raised to some of the items, and we have made certain representations to the Cabinet; though honorable members will realize that the members of the Cabinet have little opportunity for meeting to fully consider these matters. Considerable objection has been raised in commercial circles to what is generally termed the package duty, which is generally ascribed to the Tariff proposals, though, as a matter of fact, the Tariff has nothing whatever to do with it, Parliament having enacted in the Customs Act that the value of goods upon which duty must be paid shall be taken as their value free on board at the port of export. The usual practice used to be to take the value of the goods in the principal markets of the country of export, and add 10 per cent., but the provision in the Customs Act makes it incumbent upon the Customs officials to charge the duty upon the rates levied in connexion with the. packing of the goods, and the conveyance of them to our ports. That provision was inserted in the Act because we had ascertained from the various Custom-houses that in some countries there is a practice of charging upon the invoices a lower price for goods than their actual value, and increasing the charges for packing to make up. Experience has shown, however, that in order to prevent that fraud we have, to a certain extent, penalized those who deal honestly with us. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that it will apply to cigars to the same extent. As far as we can investigate the matter, it seems much more easy to determine the fair value of cigars than to arrive at the ever varying value of tea. With regard to tea, we propose to abandon the composite duty, and ask the House to impose a duty of 3d. per lb. upon ordinary tea and 4d. per lb. upon packet, tea. </para>

These are the I only matters with which we have had an opportunity of dealing up to the present time, but on Tuesday next we shall be prepared to mention to the committee all the other matters in regard to which we think we may fairly ask the House to make alterations in the proposals which have been submitted. There are a number of items, such as tea, rice, kerosene, and cotton goods, which are looked upon as practically only revenue duties, and it will be a matter for our consideration whether we shall not ask the committee to deal first with the rest of the Tariff, in order that we may see how it is finally settled, allowing these four large revenue-producing, items to stand over. In the meantime we shall have some experience of the revenue-producing power of the other items,, and that will guide us in asking the House to take a certain course in regard to the purely revenue-producing items I have mentioned. It will be well for honorable members to turn this suggestion over in their minds so that we may be able to readily ascertain the feeling of the committee when we come to the items. These are all the matters which up to the present we have been able to determine, but on Tuesday next we shall make a statement with reference to any other items upon which alterations may seem to be advisable* and mention exactly what changes we are prepared to suggest. </para>

Did I understand the Treasurer to state that in carrying out this principle of uncloaking the true designs of the Government with regard to certain articles of common use, the Government intend to uncloak the true proportion of the duties on boots and shoes and articles of clothing? </para>

                        <para>- I hope the soul of the Treasurer, now that it has entered upon the path of reform, will rise from crockery to boots and shoes and articles of clothing. I do not wish to enter into a general discussion at this stage, but I shall wait with interest the explanation of the Government as to their method of proceeding, if they agree to remove some of the composite rates and not all of them. I admit that we cannot expect an explanation at present, but I shall await developments with great interest. In the meantime, I have received the announcements of the Treasurer with the greatest possible pleasure, and now that we have enlightened Ministers sufficiently to bring them more into line with our views, our utmost efforts will be devoted to further that beneficial process, so that at least we can have a Tariff which we need not fight to the very death. I hope that will be the outcome of the reconsideration of the Tariff by Ministers. Might I ask the Treasurer, regarding a matter which is almost as important as crockery, what decision Ministers have arrived at in respect to the inclusion of agricultural machinery in the free list? I cannot understand why they should reduce the duty on crockery and not include machinery and agricultural implements in the free list. I am glad to see that tombstones have been considered, because this fact affords touching proof of the conviction of the Government that they are on the high way to their own graves, and that they are getting ready for a fitting monument. Are we to understand that agricultural implements are to be placed on the free list? </para>

                        <para>- I do not care whether it is done under an Act of Parliament. Parliament has no sacred divinity that we cannot criticise it, just as we can criticise Ministers, and no one criticises Parliament more freely than the Treasurer when he has occasion to find fault. There is no offence in my remark ; at least, there is no imputation of any personal motive. I am referring to these charges simply as a very mistaken and most deceptive course of action. Is there a man, excepting the Customs authorities, who knew when we were listening to the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs in announcing these duties - or did the right honorable gentleman tell the House - that they would be charged on the bringing of the goods down to a port of shipment, and on the cases and packing ? The right honorable gentleman may have said that that was so, because he sometimes says a great deal to himself, which we do not hear ; but I did not heard him say this. </para>

                        <para>- It was well known, no doubt, to mercantile gentlemen who have a pecuniary interest in these matters. If it had been my pecuniary interest, I should have taken trouble to look into the matter, as any business man would. This is a matter which affects all business men very keenly, but to men in other occupations, it does not come home so vividly, and consequently may be overlooked. Speaking for myself, I never dreamt when the Minister for Trade and Customs announced the percentages on the articles, that there was to be the same percentage on the cases which contained them. It is perfectly obvious that had we known such a duty was to be imposed, a great deal more would have been heard about the matter when the Customs Bill was under consideration, and I, at any rate, should have had some strong observations to make. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that at the time I had an opportunity of joining in any discussion ; at any rate, I have no recollection of it. But whether that be so or not, what we have reason to be pleased with is, that notwithstanding that the Government put this provision in the Customs Act, and came down to the House fully intending the Act to have that effect, they now, within a few hours after an Opposition attack, suddenly discover that it is necessary to undo that Act. If the Government had not brought down this infamous proposal, we should have been saved a world of time in attacking and discussing it, but now we are happy in the reflection that our attack has had a fruitful result. For the first time in his life the Minister for Trade and Custom is eating humble pie and admitting that that Tariff, which was to astonish the world, is full of imperfections. With reference to the remaining articles in the Tariff, I strongly urge the Ministers in the interests of the public, and in the interests of saving time, to put mining and agricultural machinery on the free list, and to reduce duties which now reach 100 per cent., down to an ordinary level. It would not be fair to enter into a general discussion at the present time, and I am very much obliged to the committee for having allowed me to make these remarks. </para>

                        <para>- I must point out to the Minister for Trade and Customs that, while I have no desire whatever to curtail debate, it would be altogether out of order for him to speak now on the general statement of the Treasurer. Concurrence was sought by the Treasurer and by the leader of the Opposition, and the discussion has already gone a little beyond the proper limit. If the Minister for Trade and Customs now continues the discussion, it must be with concurrence, and I wish the committee to understand that, when he has concluded, I shall then put the item. </para>

Attention has been called to errors in this document, which, of course, was hurriedly prepared, though prepared on the best authority available. It is difficult when taking out a number of items to ascertain exactly how they operate in each particular State, but we did the best we could with the assistance available here. Finding there were errors we have taken the precaution of submitting the document to the highest authorities in each State. I believe the list is now complete, and I hope the revised comparative Tariff will be available not later than to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- The spirits come from the old country under the brands of distillers who have a reputation at stake, and whose reputation would not live six months in the opinion of the Australian public if the quality deteriorated. In that fact we have a security that the bottled spirits which are properly corked and labelled, and which come off the shelves of hotels, are what they are represented to be. The Treasurer put it somewhat inadvertently yesterday that the advantage to be gained by the imposition of this duty lay in the fact that a number of people would be employed in bottling and labelling in Australia. That is a very pretty protectionist idea which I do not think has much relation to the duty upon spirits. I submit that it would be wise to adopt the system which has been in vogue in New South Wales and South Australia, of making a proper allowance for under-proof spirits not exceeding 16.5 degrees? Such a step will result in a better class of liquor being imported into the States than will be imported if we offer this absolute premium to the importers to introduce nothing but whisky, brandy, &amp;c, up to the full strength of proof. I have not the slightest fear that the adoption of the amendment will prove detrimental to the. best interests of the revenue. On the other hand I believe that the revenue will gain by encouraging the importation of such brands of case spirits as Crawford, Walker, Dawson, Catto, Buchanan, and half-a-dozen others, seeing that the distillers who bottle them are interested in keeping their quality up to a pure and proper standard. The people in Australia who consume the spirit would soon know if it went below that standard. I did not move the amendment for party reasons, and I have not even discussed it with the leader of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot understand the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. V. L. Solomon, making such a fuss about this matter, because if he has been in the trade he knows that what he has been telling the committee is not correct. I was in the trade for a good many years, and I know what takes place. He would have us believe that the only straightforward business people are those in England; that the Australians are all rogues, and would dish you up anything. The best spirit I ever sold while I was in the business was a spirit that came from Victoria. If water must be put into the spirits to be consumed, let it be Australian water, not English or Scotch water. Then we shall know what we are getting. No doubt an honest trader will sell spirits for a fair price, but you can get from dishonest traders what purports to be the same article for about half the money, but then you find that, instead of getting a gallon of spirit in six bottles, there is only that quantity in nine bottles, and the public are expected to take the value of their money in glassware. One honorable member said last night that the Government acted unfairly in charging duty where the actual quantity was only a gill above the reputed quantity in the case, but in my experience that never occurs. If any one needs to be protected, it is the consumer, who, in buying six bottles, instead of getting a gallon, nearly always gets a gill or two under. With regard to the quality of the imported article, some of the greatest rubbish that ever came into Australia has come in under Usher's brand, and is really not Usher's whisky at all, though it is sent here from the old country. </para>

                    <para>- I shall not vote for the amendment. I find that in only two of the States is an allowance made for under-proof spirit. With regard to the duty proposed, I find that Victoria is the only State which has had a lower duty - her duty having been 12s. per gallon. New South Wales has had the same duty, and the other States have had higher duties, that of Western Australia having been 16s. per gallon. In Western Australia the people are protected by the Spurious Liquor Act, and, although there have been prosecutions under that Act, there have not been many serious causes of complaint. </para>

                        <para>- I know that in a great many cases teetotallers do not recognise that hop bitters and various other preparations contain spirits. The articles to which I refer, however, are not patent medicines, but simply drugs in solution in alcohol. Take the case of cascara sagrada. That drug requires a solution of 30 per cent. of spirit in order to properly dissolve it. If the spirit is too weak, a large amount of precipitate is left, and the equal quality of the medicine is not maintained. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable members apparently overlook the fact that the officers of the department estimate that, with the excise duty proposed, the colonial spirit would be methylated and used in lieu of imported spirit. It is anticipated that there will be a revenue of £165. </para>

                        <para>- But still, it is from the import duty that the £165 is expected. From the excise on colonial methylated spirits the customs expect £7,800, at 6d. per gallon. There might be something in the contention that the excise should be increased, but in the meantime 3s. per gallon is a fair import duty. </para>

                        <para>- A very valuable statement has been made in the form of a letter to the Minister of Customs, a copy of which I, with other honorable members, have received. In that letter objection was taken to the wine rates, and amongst others to the proposed duty of 12s. per gallon upon sparkling wines. It was pointed out that that duty would result in a comparatively small revenue, and a recommendation was made in 1894 by the Victorian Commission to fix a much lower rate. </para>

                        <para>- I think we are entitled to give some weight to the opinion of the Licensed Victuallers' Association of Victoria, which seems to have devoted a good deal of attention to this subject. The letter relies not only on the reports of the Commission of 1894, but upon statements which were subsequently made in the Victorian Legislative Assembly when the report was under discussion, and when the Tariff was reopened. Quoting from the report of the commission of 1894, the Association points out that when the duties were increased, there was a considerable shrinkage in the revenue. There was a shrinkage from £42,914 in 1890-1, to £37,903 in 1891-2, to £23,432 in 1892-3, and to £14,862 in 1893-4. These figures sustain the contention that the duties resulted in a very considerable shrinkage of the revenue. To a large extent that shrinkage could not be accounted for by any greater intensity of the depression. The report states - </para>

                <para>This large decrease has been represented to us by importers as being due, ina great measure, to the high duties having placed foreign wine beyond the purchasing power of the consumers. This we believe to be the case, and we accordingly recommend a return to the rate that preceded the Tariff of 1892, viz., still wines, 6s. per gallon; sparkling wines,8s. per gallon. </para>

                <para>Mr.CONROY (Werriwa). - I desire to point out that in three of the States, namely, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, the duty which has hitherto been imposed upon sparkling wines is 10s. per gallon. . Undoubtedly, Queensland and Western Australia would endeavour to derive the maximum of revenue from this source, because there was no chance of any locally made article affecting the consumption of the imported. What I fear is that if we impose too large a duty upon this line, we shall find ourselves in the position of receiving a diminished revenue. That is the danger against which I wish to guard. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I think that is altogether too high. No Treasurer in search of revenue would dream of levying such a rate. If the Ministry can assure me that they have given this matter the fullest consideration, and that they do not think their officers have over-estimated the revenue to be derived from this source, I shall say no more in regard to it. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to point out that this impost really affords a 1 2s. per gallon protective duty to what is a very large industry in the States at the present time. As a matter of fact there is a considerable quantity of champagne made in Australia. A very large consumption of it took place in connexion with the recent celebrations. If the imported wines only had been used at those festivities, considerably more revenue would have resulted. I think we might fairly impose an excise duty upon sparkling wines, especially as a similar duty already exists in connexion with spirits which are distilled within the Commonwealth, and upon tobacco which is locally manufactured. The whole of Australia is now open to the locally made article, whereas in a number of States a duty of 12s. per gallon formerly operated. It seems to be a fair thing in the interests of the revenue that this industry should contribute excise. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but as a matter of fact the Commonwealth Government could not prevent wine containing over 35 per cent. of proof spirit from being shipped to Great Britain or elsewhere, nor interfere with its sale in the local hotels. There are good sound wines of recognised brands which have been coming here for many years which contain over 35 per cent., but under 40 per cent., of proof spirit ; and it seems to me that consideration should be given to such wines. They should not be charged the full spirit duty. Another matter to which I would refer is this : A large quantity of wine is now on the water, or being shipped in execution of orders at the sources of supply, or in bond, which, under the State Tariffs, would not have been required to pay the full spirit duty, and it would be a great injustice to the importers if the duty were increased without notice. I suggest to the Minister that a certain duty should be charged for wine containing not more than 35 per cent. of proof spirit, a higher duty for wine containing not more than 40 per cent., and, if necessary, the full spirit duty for wine containing more than 40 per cent. of spirit. The Minister is in a better position to prevent the consumption of injurious imported wine than to prevent the consumption of injurious colonial wine, because the latter comes under his control only in the process of fortification, while he can, by proclamation, at once put a stop to the importation of what he considers deleterious wines. I shall not move an amendment until the Minister has had an opportunity of considering the matter. </para>

                    <para>- I urge the Minister of Trade and Customs to make a concession in this matter. The statements made by the honorable member for North Sydney are in accordance with the information which has been supplied to me. I believe that the better class of ports and sherries cannot be brought here unless they contain over 35 per cent. of proof spirit, and hitherto such wines have been permitted to enter "Victoria, Tasmania, the other States, and New Zealand. I have here the results of tests of two samples of colonial port; one delivered in Melbourne three months ago, and the. other delivered on the 12th inst. The first sample contains 39 per cent. of proof spirit, and the second 37 per cent. ; and I am informed that that amount of spirit is necessary to prevent the fermentation of the sugar in ports and sherries. In my opinion the Government will lose revenue if they insist upon the high duty now proposed upon such wines. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure honorable members do not wish to be unjust in this matter to either the importer or the local producer ; but lately, when the Distillation Bill was under consideration, we applied ourselves to the consideration of the question where does wine end and spirit begin, and we laid it down in the clearest terms that wine must not contain more than 35 per cent. of proof spirit. In my opinion, when a man buys wine he should not be given something almost red-hot with spirit. In the famous section over which there was so much debate, it was provided that no Australian wine should be fortified so as to contain more than 35 per cent. of proof spirit, or with any other than with pure wine spirit. It is provided that no person shall sell any Australian wine containing more than 35 per cent. of proof spirit. </para>

If the imported wine contains above 35 per cent. of spirit, it shall be considered as spirit and dealt with accordingly. </para>

In this connexion we have received very strong representations from representative bodies, and I shall quote one authority which will particularly interest the honorable member for North Sydney, namely, the Wine Association of New South Wales. They object to any increase over 35 per cent. of proof spirit. They contend that if local wine is restricted to 35 per cent., foreign wine should be dealt with in like manner. It has been suggested that it is necessary to highly fortify the wines that are sent out here in order to preserve them on the voyage, but the members of the Wine Association say - </para>

There is no use in going to a division in. this matter, because the protective incidence of the duty will insure the defeat of any attempt to reduce it. I am glad, however, of the assurance that justice is to be done to the extent of allowing, some concession, with regard to goods that were ordered and shipped prior to the Tariff coming into operation. . </para>

                    <para>- In connexion with these duties I have been of opinion all along that we should, as far as possible, insist upon getting the maximum revenue. Upon opium most of the States have hitherto been charging a duty of 20s. per lb. Western Australia and New Zealand, however, have had somewhat different rates. In Western Australia it is 30s., and in New Zealand 40s. a lb. Opium smoking is not a desirable thing to encourage, and the commodity is properly taxable. I suggest that the duty should be increased to 25s, or 24s. a lb., and I move - </para>

                    <para>- I had intended to move that the duty on opium be increased to a larger amount than 24s. per lb. My idea is that it should beat least 30s. per lb., or even £2 per lb., and I shall endeavour to show that if the committee increase the duty, there will be a considerable increase of revenue, without any increase in the quantity of opium consumed. With the exception of Western Australia, where the duty has been 30s. per lb., the proposed duty is not higher than that in the State Tariffs, but the higher duty in Western Australia did not injuriously affect the revenue of that State. The Government estimate that from a duty of 20s. per lb., they will get a revenue of £2,000 from Western Australia, but the revenue formerly collected in that State from a duty of 30s. in the pound, was £3,247. Therefore, when the sliding scale now in existence in Western Australia is abolished, as it must be within five years, and I hope will be long before that time, if there is no increase in the proposed duty the Chinese in that State, and those who resort to their dens to indulge in opium smoking, will receive a present of £1,247 a year. Opium differs from other commodities in the respect that, while the reduction of the duty upon it may increase its consumption, the raising of the duty upon it, unless it becomes almost prohibitory, is not likely to decrease its consumption, because those who indulge in the practice of opium-eating and opium smoking are such slaves to the vice that they must obtain the drug to satisfy their cravings. If the duty were increased to 30s. per pound, the Treasurer would derive in revenue for the whole Commonwealth £80,000 instead of £58,000. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think ; at has happened in New Zealand, and of course, it is for the authorities to put down smuggling. In1887, the duty upon opium imported into New Zealand was 20s. per lb., and the quantity imported during the year 4,427 lbs., returning a revenue of £4,427. In 1888, the duty was increased to 40s. per lb., and in 1889, the quantity imported under the higher duty was 3,788 lbs., and the revenue collected upon it £7,576. So that, under the lower duty in 1887, nearly 700 lbs. more were imported than under the higher duty in 1889, while over £3,000 less went into the Treasury. The extent to which the vice of opium smoking prevails in the great cities of the Eastern States is notorious. Not only do white people frequent the opium dens, but even small boys and girls contract the dreadful habit of opium smoking. I believe that to in crease the duty upon opium would tend to suppress the vice here. This duty is in no sense protective, because there is no local production of opium, and, therefore, it can be considered without party feeling. </para>

                    <para>- We are very little in sympathy with the opium smoking habit, but, at the same time, we desire to obtain a fair amount of revenue; although, of course, if we were discussing the matter from a certain aspect, we should not be sorry to see opium done awa)' with altogether. We think that we shall be acting fairly under all the circumstances by accepting a proposal for the increase of the duty to 30s. </para>

                    <para>- I do not anticipate that the revenue will be affected through smuggling consequent upon increased duties, because in the Northern Territory the duty on opium was fixed at 30s. and the result per head was a little greater than in South Australia. I assume that the opium smoking is confined to Chinamen in South Australia, and certainly there is no greater proportion of white opium smokers in South Australia than in the Territory. The opium duty at 30s. per lb. in the Northern Territory yields over £6,000 a year whilst the 20s. duty in South Australia yields £286 per annum. As the Chinese population in the Northern Territory is about 4,000 and the Chinese in South Australia number 200, it will be seen that the productivity per head of the 30s. duty is as great as that of the 20s. duty The Treasurer told us to-day that the package duties would be removed tomorrow. I am informed that wharfage, cost of entry, and bills of lading, and buyers' commission ave sometimes added to the value of this import, causing the duty to be nearly double. I have seen it stated that on a 481b.' parcel of opium, the duty on which at 20s. would be £4S is raised by these charges to £67. </para>

                    <para>- I am in favour of a higher rate of duty on opium ; in fact, I should prefer to prohibit the importation of this drug for smoking purposes. But the increased duty will affect very materially the price of extract of opium which is used medicinally. I am advised that extract of opium is charged at a higher rate of duty than even that imposed on ordinary commercial opium - that while commercial opium will be 20s. per lb., the extract will be charged 40s. . I am told that if we raise the duty on smoking opium to 30s., then the duty on the extract of opium will be 60s., which will operate relatively on liquid extracts and tinctures. On liquid extract and tinctures, which are used medicinally, The rate of duty charged is in strict relation to the proportion of opium they contain. I need not point out to honorable members the enormous Value which the British Pharmacopoeia places on the extract of opium as an anodyne. Many medical men say that supposing they had to go into some savage country and could take only one drug with them, they would take opium in preference to any other in the pharmacopoeia, though some place their choice on chloroform, iron and other 21 ii 2 drugs. A very large proportion of medical men believe that opium is one of the most valuable drugs we have with which to aid suffering humanity. My own personal idea is, as I have said, that we should prohibit the importation of opium for smoking purposes ; but I should very much regret to see such a heavy impost as 60s. per lb. placed on extract of opium and kindred medicinal preparations. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly the duty under the State Tariffs has been too high, and has caused smuggling. Opium is a thing that is very easily smuggled. Thousands of persons in eastern countries do not go to greater excess in the use of opium than do many persons here in the use of tobacco. Besides, habitual opium users rarely have children to whom to transmit their vices, which is not the case with victims of the drink habit. If we could prevent its use by passing an Act of Parliament, I am sure honorable members would, on strictly moral grounds, vote for such a measure ; but we cannot do so. </para>

                        <para>- What is the use of trying what has failed in other countries ? All we can do is to regulate the traffic. I think a duty of £1 per lb. is a little high, and the effect of raising the duty beyond that amount will certainly be to diminish the revenue, while the consumption will not be decreased. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members must not forget that opium is largely used in medicines, and is probably the most valuable medicinal drug which is known. Many medical men if they had to travel into an unknown or savage country would take opium with them in preference to any other drug, because it does more to ease pain and to give sleep and rest than any other. Chlorodyne, which has saved the lives of many persons in Australia, is merely a preparation of opium ; so, too, are chloral and laudanum. </para>

                        <para>- If the duty can be increased without injuring the revenue, I should be willing to agree to the amendment, though I still think that we should not increase the duty upon opium used in medicines. I understand that it is now intended to make some allowance in respect to opium introduced for medicinal purposes when we come to consider the item relating to drugs, but I do not see how the Government are going to make any exception in that way. We have one or two chemical laboratories here which make up various medicinal preparations, but these institutions will be very largely hampered in their operations by the extent to which the ingredients used in their preparations are taxed under the Tariff. I hope, for the reasons I have stated, that the Government will adhere to their original proposal. </para>

                    <para>- I was very much surprised to hear the remarks of the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, and I cannot allow his statements to go forth without some contradiction, because some people, relying on the honorable and learned member, may regard opium, chloral, and laudanum as innocent articles of. consumption. I say that there never was a more abominable and, at the same time, insidious form of poisoning than that of opium consumption ; and if I had my way 1 would at one stroke do away with all those nostrums in which opium masquerades in varying proportions, and which, while they temporarily assuage pain, kill the body and soul of persons who take them. As to opium being the greatest medicine of Australia, I would rather believe that beer itself was the greatest medicine. Beer, at least, is open and plain in its attack ; but the man who takes chlorodyne to ease pain gradually falls into the habit of taking it on idi conceivable occasions, for this, or that, or the other thing, until he acquires a vice which ends in his ruin. Similarly, the fashionable woman, seeking to remedy the consequences 'of society dissipation, plunges a hypodermic syringe in her vein, and saturates her system with chloral or morphia, inflicting irretrievable injury upon it. To say that this is the greatest medicine in Australia is to convey a grossly inaccurate impression, for the opium habit is one of the greatest curses that could be introduced into any country. As for the revenue, I think that that will be safeguarded by the imposition of a 30s. duty, as well as by a duty of 20s. I do not believe that smuggling will be more extensively practised ; but if it be more largely resorted to, it is not likely to evade the vigilance of the Customs officers any more under a 30s. tax than under a 20s. duty. Opium lends itself readily to the machinations of the smuggler, but not more readily at a 30s. duty than at a 20s. duty. Looking at the matter from the stand-point of morality, we can do no harm by imposing the higher duty, but, on the Other hand, we may do much good. As to the suggestion that the men who now smoke opium will, in the event of the higher duty being passed, take to eating it by taking chloral, or some other form of the drug, I understand that all these drugs will be taxed 'proportionately to the amount of opium they contain, and that therefore when we raise the tax on opium by 10s. per lb., we shall also raise the duty on laudanum and other preparations, in proportion to their opium contents. I do not believe that the vast majority of the people who take opium in this country, who are Chinese, will find themselves in a position to pay the increased price, and therefore, if we increase the price by 50 per cent, to an extent at any rate we shall ward the danger off those foolish and youthful persons who are now trembling on the verge of this dreadful habit. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. The consumption of opium amounted to something over 1. lb. per head on all the Chinese in the territory. It is all very well to try to check the consumption of opium, but I can tell honorable members that in any portion of Northern Australia where the Chinese are to be found in numbers, no duty will prevent them from getting opium. If the duty is increased too much they will smuggle the drug. They have paid a 30s. duty, and have contributed very handsomely to the revenue, but if the duty were increased to £5 per lb., the result would not be to increase the revenue, but to greatly increase the amount of smuggling. Opium is very easily smuggled, and the higher the duty the greater the inducement to evade the Customs. The proposed increase will not, I think, decrease the revenue, seeing that in the Territory to which most of the opium goes, the Chinese consume an average of 1 lb. per head per annum. With reasonable watchfulness smuggling might be prevented, but to go beyond the figure I have mentioned would be a mistake. There must be a quantity of opium used in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- That is unfortunate ; because, as has been stated, I do not see that the extra duty will prevent the state of things I have described. In Queensland, the opium habit has been growing to a considerable extent for a number of years, and in some parts of the back country young girls and young people generally have taken to smoking the drug. I am informed that a similar state of affairs exists in the backblocks of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- That being the case, I believe Parliament would cordially support the action of the Government if a proclamation were issued carrying out in effect the provisions of the Bill introduced by the Treasurer in the Victorian State Parliament. If the Ministry would take advantage of this provision in the Customs Regulation Act, and prohibit the importation of opium except for medicinal purposes, their action would be indorsed by 99 per cent. of the members of this House, and of the people of the Commonwealth. I could refer to evidence given before Royal Commissions in England and elsewhere, showing the dreadful results of opium smoking. Every one is seized with the importance of some action being taken, and if honorable members would only take the trouble to read the evidence that I have felt it my duty to read, they would not hesitate for one moment to urge the Government to take prompt steps to prohibit the importation of opium. </para>

                        <para>- If that were done, then further steps could be taken. At present we appear to be anxious to obtain revenue from a traffic in which we do not believe, and which is demoralizing a large number of families in the Commonwealth. I speak somewhat warmly, because I have looked into this matter, and feel that in the interests of the people some drastic steps should be taken. I hope the Government will take prompt action not with the sole view of obtaining revenue, but to prevent opium from being brought into the Commonwealth. I am informed that when once a person becomes addicted to opium smoking it is very rarely that he is able to emancipate himself from the baneful habit. For that reason I trust that the Government will see fit to carry out the provision of the Customs Regulations Act, and prohibit the continuance of this demoralising traffic. </para>

I am aware that the evil of opium-smoking is a very extensive one, and that it ramifies all through Australia. At the same time I think we ought to hesitate before taking to such an extreme step as prohibiting the importation of this drug. If there is any desire to take that step I think it would be better to defer the consideration of this item. Personally I should be inclined to increase the duty, even up to 40s. per lb., in preference to prohibiting the importation of the drug. </para>

                        <para>- If we attempt to prohibit the importation of any particular article, but allow it to be admitted under certain exemptions, we at once open the door to all kinds of fraud. It is like prohibiting the importation of liquor and then allowing chemists to dispense it. I think, therefore, that great danger is to be apprehended from the absolute prohibition of this drug. It is well for us to advance cautiously, to increase the duty first and to observe what the effect of that increase is. If we attempt to prohibit its introduction we shall involve the Customs department in an enormous amount of trouble besides offering a premium to swindling, whilst to a large extent the provision will remain a dead letter. Of course I believe in adopting stringent measures with regard to the admission of any article which affects the health and character of the people, but, at the same time, I am adverse to enacting any law which in its operation will be ineffective. Instead of going to the extreme proposed by some honorable members it would be well to increase the duty. </para>

                    <para>For instance, how was it that opium could be bought in Little Bourke-street for a much less price than would be charged for it elsewhere? When he first became aware of the fact, he was very curious about it, and a Chinese merchant, now dead, let him into some of the secrets. In fact, the man went so far as to admit that he had made a very large amount of money by smuggling opium, and he explained some of the methods adopted. One plan was to purchase in Holland a large consignment of Dutch toys of a hollow character. These were sent on to China, where every hollow was filled up with opium, after which the goods were forwarded to Amsterdam, from thence carried to London, and thence to Melbourne. Another plan was to buy cedar logs at Manilla, and fill every possible hollow in them with opium. One of the most successful plans of all was to purchase a lot of cigars in Manilla, and put in every box of them a few solid cigar-shaped masses of opium, covered round with tobacco leaves, there not being enough in any box to make a noticeable difference in the weight. That Chinese merchant seemed to think he had done a creditable thing in smuggling opium into Victoria in such ways. </para>
                    <para>When smuggling can be carried on in such a simple way it is almost impossible for the Customs authorities to effectually prevent the introduction of opium. I think, therefore, that the committee cannot do better than vote for an increase of the duty to 30s. per lb., especially as the experience of New Zealand shows that when the rate upon this drug was raised from 20s. per lb. to 40s. per lb., the revenue in one year increased from £4,000 to £7,000, whereas the consumption of opium decreased by 700 lbs. </para>

I believe that, before any reform can be effected, public opinion must be educated up to a proper standard. Therefore, I think that the proposal of the Government is the wisest one under the circumstances. </para>

                        <para>- How did the Minister arrive at that basis? A duty which might have assisted an industry in any particular State, when that State had a Tariff of its own, cannot be relied upon to assist that industry to the same extent now that all the States are united. In New South Wales the difference of 9d. between the import and excise duties on tobacco has been sufficient to establish there a large and profitable industry. </para>

                        <para>- Colonial leaf will be more largely used throughout Australia in the future than it has been in the past; but I am leaving it out of the question just now. New South Wales has been able to establish a successful manufacturing industry with a difference of 9d. per lb., and by increasing the difference under the Commonwealth duties to1s. per lb., you will not place the other States in a better position to compete with her. The output of the New South Wales tobacco factories in1897 was 1,872,736 lbs., and in 1900, 2,178,656 lbs., an increase of over 300,000 lbs., or one-sixth of the total production, in four years. Besides the advantage which the manufacturers of the Commonwealth will get from the difference between the import and excise duties, they will have an advantage of £50,000or £60,000 in the use of Australian grown leaf, upon which they will have no duty to pay. We may anticipate that the growing of tobacco in Australia will increase. Their tobacco expert has declared that in Queensland there is land admirably suited for the growth of tobacco. He anticipates that leaf can be produced there which will be, not only good enough for mixing purposes - which has been the sole use hitherto for colonial leaf - but good enough to. be placed upon the market as a separate tobacco. Under these circumstances I fail to see why the Government have reduced the New South Wales excise duty from1s. 3d. to1s. If a difference of 9d. has been sufficient to establish the manufacturing industry in New South Wales, it should be sufficient to establish it throughout the Commonwealth. By keeping the import duty at 3s.6d., and increasing the excise duty by 3d. per lb., the Commonwealth would gain £50,000 in revenue without doing any injury to the tobacco manufacturers. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it will rather tend to diminish the revenue, and for that reason, and because the Government have not promised to increase the excise duty, I propose to move the reduction of the import duty to 3s. per lb. But before we come to deal with that question. I should like to point out that whereas upon imported tobacco the duty is charged upon " the weight of tags, labels, and other attachments," in the case of locally manufactured tobacco it is charged only upon the tobacco itself. To charge duty upon attachments to the imported tobacco seems an extraordinary provision, but if the duty is to be charged in that way there should be equality of treatment, and the imported and local tobaccoes should be treated alike. </para>

                        <para>- That is all she will get, and she will lose the difference between that and the full duty on the imported tobacco. Tasmania does not manufacture tobacco. The leaf is imported in a manufactured form, and I do not think very much colonial-grown tobacco is used in the State. However, I certainly think that in common fairness the Ministry should see that the duty on the manufactured imported article is reduced to 3s. per lb., and that the excise duty is increased. I intend to move that the words " including the weight of tags, labels, and other attachments," be struck out, and I shall do this in the interests of the workingmen of Australia. I do not smoke myself, but I think it is hardly fair to ask men, in addition to paying a heavy duty on the tobacco they actually smoke, to also pay a similar impost upon all the tags of lead or other metal which are affixed to the cakes of tobacco they use. </para>

                        <para>- In the aggregate they represent a very considerable weight. I need hardly point out that in the Excise Act there is no mention made of these things. There are certain higher classes of tobacco which are wrapped up in tinfoil or paper, in order to preserve the full strength and aroma of the leaf, and these wrappings add very considerably to the weight of the article. The duty on these attachments will amount to a very considerable item in connexion with imported leaf, whilst it is intended to allow "Victorian and New South Wales made tobacco to pass into consumption without any such burden upon it. If the Government insist upon levying a duty upon the attachments to these cakes of tobacco, the result will be that the only guarantee that the public now have that they are getting tobacco of a certain manufacture will be removed, as the manufacturers will cease to attach tags and labels, and the public will probably have </para>

                        <para>- The latter figure represents about 500 tons, so that Messrs. Dixon cannot have manufactured the quantity of tobacco which has been stated. Here are the figures for New South Wales. Last year 996,000 lbs. of locally-grown leaf were manufactured. The imports of manufactured tobacco totalled' 1,181,000 lbs., and -,the local manufacture of imported leaf represented 858,000 lbs. In Victoria The imports of manufactured tobacco totalled 745,000 lbs., whilst there was made up from imported leaf 1,328,000 lbs., and from locally-grown leaf 120,000 lbs. It will be seen, therefore, that however much this duty may encourage the manufacture of imported leaf at home, it does not seem to encourage the growing of the local leaf. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to point out that the protection enjoyed by this industry in Victoria has ranged from 100 to 150 per cent. In New South Wales it has ranged from 65 to 100 per cent ; whilst in Queensland it has been over 400 per cent. I admit that such a high rate of protection is not altogether prohibitive, because there are people who will have imported tobacco at any cost. Notwithstanding these enormously high duties, the imported tobacco comes in in large quantities, and is consumed by our people. One would imagine that, with the protection afforded by such duties, we could produce all the tobacco necessary for our local requirements, and run the imported tobacco almost out of the market. But notwithstanding these high duties, there is not much locally grown tobacco, either in Victoria or New South Wales. </para>

In New South Wales there were 541 moles and 259 females employed. Here again we observe that fatal tendency in Victoria to employ females instead of males. There are more females employed in Victoria than there are males, whilst in New South Wales the female operatives are outnumbered by the males by two to one. An industry which employs such a small number of hands cannot be said to be one which we ought to protect to any great extent. </para>

                        <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for the suggestion, because that is practically what it amounts to. In New South Wales the large manufacturers of tobacco are doing exceedingly well. I believe that last year the largest paid a dividend of 121/2 per cent. Is it worth while to deplete the revenue to the extent of £200,000 a year in order to provide employment for 1,000 operatives in Victoria and 750 in New South Wales? </para>

                        <para>- Then we need not trouble so much about levelling the excise duty up to the import duty. In that case we shall see whether the consumer will get the benefit or not. I apprehend that if the prices were the same in each case we should not consume very much of the locally manufactured article. This margin between the excise duty and the import duty, if it means anything, means protection for the locally manufactured article, and I should like to hear from the Government why they are proposing to alter this margin. The tobacco manufacturing industry affords a very striking example of the utter ineffectiveness of protective duties in the direction of finding employment for the workless, and building up large industries in our midst. I ask whether it is worth our while to sacrifice the revenue for the purpose of allowing industries to exist which alford employment to only a small number of people at a moderate wage. The question asked by the honorable member for Coolgardie to-day was particularly apropos. He desired to know what steps the Government were going to take to guarantee that the people employed in protected industries would get a share of the profits derivable from the protective duties ? Considering the high profits that the tobacco manufacturers have been making, I think that at least 50 percent, of the increase in the duty should go towards raising the wages of The operatives. </para>

                        <para>- I am not So sure but that the Government would derive more revenue from a lower rate of duty than from a higher rate. If the duty on imports is reduced, it will level up the margin between import and excise duties which now causes such a great leakage in the revenue. It does not matter very much whether the excise duty is raised or the import duty is decreased. Tobacco is a source of revenue that can be exploited to the highest legitimate point, and we are all agreed that narcotics and stimulants should pay as heavily as possible to the revenue of the country. In view of the large reductions that are likely to be made upon other items in the Tariff the Government will probably find it necessary to avail themselves of these special sources of revenue to the fullest extent. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the honorable member who has just sat down that this is an item which should be used for the purpose of raising revenue, and as the Government will probably have to face a reduction of the duties they propose upon several general lines in the Tariff, they will do well to avail themselves of all the opportunities of raising money through duties upon narcotics and stimulants. We have the experience of The States to guide us as to the rate of duty upon tobacco which is best calculated to produce a large amount of revenue, and I think that statistics could be brought to bear to show that a lower duty than that now proposed would produce a larger amount of revenue, and that it would be well for the committee to reduce the import duty upon manufactured tobacco to 3s. per lb. This is the duty which has prevailed in New South Wales, and which would be found acceptable throughout the Commonwealth. I think that we should be assisting the revenue, and at the same time offering less premium to persons interested in the tobacco trade who have received an immense amount of protection at the expense of the general community. In all cases where duties are levied the proceeds should go direct into the Treasury rather than into the pockets of the manufacturers, whom we are told have enormously increased their wealth in recent years. One company that operates in New South Wales has received a large benefit from the import duty, and has paid a dividend of 20 per cent. upon its capital, whilst carrying to the reserve fund an amount equivalent to 80 per cent, of its capital. </para>

                        <para>- I had a copy which is now in the hands of another honorable member, who will probably read the figures to the committee. The tobacco industry should not receive any special protection, because only a comparatively small number of persons find employment in connexion with it. There are only 1,000 operatives employed in New South Wales, and only 750 in Victoria. That is a very small number of persons to be employed in an industry that shows such immense profits. During the last two years, although the output of tobacco has increased enormously, the. number of male operatives has not been increased by more than 36, whilst 70 additional women and children have found employment. At the same time by means of improved machinery the tobacco manufacturers have been able to greatly extend their operations, and to largely augment their profits. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I can name the company if necessary. I consider that the import duty on manufactured tobacco should be reduced to 3s. per lb., and that there should be an increase in the excise duty on tobacco locally manufactured. If this were done the importations would increase, and there would be a relative decrease in the importation of leaf tobacco for manufacturing purposes. An increase in the excise duty to1s. 6d. should receive consideration. The honorable member for Laanecoorie asked why it was that that the local manufacturer could afford to sell his tobacco at a lower price than was charged for the imported manufactured article. A great advantage is derived by the local manufacturer from the admixture of other elements with the tobacco leaf. </para>

                        <para>- No, because although the local manufacturer pays the excise duty upon the full weight of the manufactured article, consisting of tobacco leaf and other elements, he only pays the customs duty on leaf which has been imported. In all probability those who are manufacturers will become importers, and the keen competition among the importers will be sufficient protection to the general public. </para>

                        <para>- I am showing that there would be no loss to the State by paying such pensions, and incidentally I may mention that I am in favour of old age pensions. In an industry subsidized to the extent that this is, it reflects no credit on the employers that they should pay actually less wages per head than are paid in any other branch of manufacture in the Commonwealth. The Government should take the advice of the committee and reduce the duty to 3s., and I shall be prepared to support a proposition to raise the excise so that there may be no advantage to the manufacturer. Those honorable members who twitted the honorable member for Parramatta and asked him as to his views on free-trade, will not be disposed to twit me in the same way, because under this proposition no advantage will be given to the manufacturer other than in regard to the freedom from duty on the weight added to the tobacco by the admixture of other things during the process of the manufacture. </para>

                    <para>- This question has been confused with that of excise, which comes on for consideration later. As to the enormous profits which it is said the manufacturers of tobacco are making, I desire to say that these profits have very little effect indeed on the producer. The largest profits have been made by manufacturers who are largely, if not altogether, importers of unmanufactured leaf, which is grown almost entirely in America, though some of it comes from Manilla and the Philippine Islands. This leaf is grown by negro labour, which is the cheapest in America, and, perhaps, the cheapest in any part of the world, and it is brought out here to compete with the local production. I am aware that a large number of Chinese are engaged in the cultivation of tobacco at the present time in the Commonwealth, but under a different set of conditions to those which prevail in the sugar growing industry. The cultivation of tobacco can be carried on under conditions which are not at all distasteful or injurious to the white man. There is no healthier occupation, and with the magnificent climate in certain parts of Victoria, New South Wales, and especially in Queensland, there is no reason why we should not grow tobacco leaf equal, if not superior, to the best leaf which comes from Virginia. After very careful inquiry, I do not see any reason to quarrel with the proposal of the Government, but I feel satisfied that the grower would be benefited by an increase in the duty on the unmanufactured leaf. </para>

                        <para>- That is the reason I would not make such a proposal myself. The result of an increase on the Government proposal would be a stimulation of the growth of tobacco in the Commonwealth, but I recognise that if it is to be of any good to the grower, it must be followed by a decrease in the revenue. In my opinion it is only a matter of time before the locally grown leaf will completely oust the imported leaf. </para>

                        <para>- That is where the best leaf is grown, and will be grown in future. The best leaf is grown in Queensland mainly because of the climatic conditions, but also in a large degree because of the splendid action of the Government there in giving every encouragement to the local grower. The result of that encouragement has been an increase of hundreds per cent. in the tobacco grown, whilst in every other State there has been a decrease. In Victoria, the decrease has been due to the ill-advised action of the Government, of which the Treasurer was the head, in altering the differential duties, which closed one-fourth of the factories. </para>

                        <para>- Tobacco is grown in Queensland, where proper encouragement is given. In 1895, before the Victorian Government altered the relation between the excise and the duty, there were 2,029 acres under cultivation in Victoria, from which were produced 15,223 cwts. of leaf. In the year following the alteration of the excise the acreage fell to 1,264 acres, the next year to 522 acres, and the next to 78 acres, while in 1899-1900 there were 155 acres under cultivation. When the excise was altered there were 303 growers, whereas to-day there are only 28, and the production has decreased in proportion. Prom 1875 and 1876 the acreage and production was increasing year by year, and in 1895 the value of the leaf grown was over £30,000 in one year. </para>

We have done remarkably well with our onion crops, and we should have done well with our tobacco crops, the profits of which are greater, but for the unfortunate action of the Treasurer when Premier of Victoria. Prom personal experience I know that for an expert workman there is no trade which offers the same advantages as the tobacco trade. American tobacco can be landed in the Commonwealth at 9d. per lb., and yet it is possible to pay twisters 4d. per lb. here doing only one part of the work. I have for seen an expert workman make up 561b., or half-a-hundred weight, of tobacco in the morning, and thus earn 18s. 8d. Is there any other trade which offers such wages? </para>

                        <para>- I understood the honorable member to do so, and to complain of women and children being employed. It is a fallacy to take average wages as an indication. In the tobacco industry there is a great deal of work which can well be done by women, and boys and girls, such as " stemming " and " stripping," and they receive good wages, considering their years. The expert workman who has passed his apprenticeship, and who in all the factories is paid on piece, can earn anything from £2 to £5 per week, and I have known several men in one Melbourne factory who earned £6 week after week. There need be very little said about the customs duty, but when we come to the question of excise it will be necessary, if we are to give any protection to those engaged in the industry, both as growers and manufacturers, to preserve the distinction which the Government have made between the customs and excise duties. </para>

                        <para>- My experience tells me that that is not sufficient. If the honorable member's suggestion were carried out, and the excise duty were raised to the customs rate, or if the customs rate were reduced so as to more nearly approach the excise duty, we should become simply importers and not manufacturers. I think there is very little in the argument which has been used as to the advisability of pensioning off a number of our workmen. I prefer very much that we should have those men employed than that we should pay them pensions for doing nothing. Notwithstanding what the honorable member for Parramatta has said, I claim that it would not pay the State to keep those men in idleness. It is far better to have them employed, and pay them something for their labour, than to pay them a direct premium for idleness. Such a step would sap our national character, and be most- disastrous to the community. The question of an import duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. upon tobacco has no relation whatever to the question of protection. It is a customs duty for the purpose of raising revenue. When we come to consider the question of excise, the advisability of protecting the tobacco industry must be considered, and then probably honorable members will have an opportunity of saying whether it shall continue in our midst or not. I feel that we must obtain revenue, and from stimulants and narcotics we are entitled to raise the greatest possible amount. Under these circumstances I am entirely opposed to the reduction of the rate of 3s. 6d. per lb. I believe it would be infinitely better to raise the duty to 4s. per lb. After due inquiry, I have felt for a considerable time that we should be doing the best for the Commonwealth, for the revenue, and for the tobacco industry, if we adopted the Queensland rates. However, I am satisfied with the proposals of the Government, and intend to support them. </para>

                    <para>- No doubt the idea suggested in the amendment is a very admirable one, but at the present time it is utterly impracticable. It is a proposal that covers a very large area and revolutionises the existing order of things to -a considerable extent. It could not possibly be fully discussed by the committee within the time at our disposal this session. It is rather the ideal scheme of those who look to the socialism Of the future. I regard the item of tobacco as one to which we must look for a considerable revenue. The major portion of our industrial population use tobacco. If they ceased to do so we should be very seriously concerned as to how the deficiency thus occasioned in the revenue could' be made up. To the industrial workers an increased duty of 6d. per lb. probably represents an additional annual outlay of 6s. or 7s. But they pay this duty in such a form that they hardly realize that they are paying it. I am not very much concerned as to whether the impost is 3s. or 3s. 6d. per lb., but I am concerned about the production of -.tobacco in Australia. Those who talk so glibly about the margin between the excise duty and the customs rate, and declare that -the equalization of these duties would merely threw 1,000 operatives in Melbourne out of employment, look only at a very small factor in the question. I say that we ought to regard the growth of tobacco leaf as one of the primary industries of which we hear so much. .1 may point out that in New South Wales, in id88, there wore no less than 4,833 acres under tobacco cultivation. The average value of the tobacco crop is £15 per acre, so that 20 acres of land would keep a family in a fair degree of comfort, and give a return of £300 per annum. The area devoted to tobacco culture in 1888 in New South Wales would, under the conditions of primary production, to which some honorable members have devoted so much attention, keep one family only. But that area has from one cause and another been reduced to 546 acres at the present time. 4,883 acres, if devoted to tobacco culture, would be sufficient to support 240 families, and to give them far more remunerative employment than is at present afforded .to many people among our industrial population. In Victoria the position of affairs is just as bad - in fact, it is a little worse. The largest area ever cultivated in Victoria was 2,029 acres, in 1895, but the area fell off to 155 acres in 1899. In connexion with this particular item revenue is the first consideration, but if we are to give profitable employment and healthy occupations to our population, we shall not neglect other aspects of the matter. I shall oppose any attempt to reduce the margin between the import and excise duties. Those who say that in Australia the growing of the tobacco leaf occupies the attention of Chinese or of kanakas for the most part, must not forget that the operation of recent legislation will cause the number of kanakas and Chinese to gradually diminish. To say that none but Chinamen can grow tobacco in Australia is an absurdity. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking with some little knowledge of this subject, because the greater part of the tobacco grown in Victoria is produced in my constituency. The land on which the tobacco has been grown is worth, for ordinary purposes, from 10s. to 15s. per acre per annum, whereas for tobacco - growing purposes it is worth from £3 to £4 per acre per annum, when a market can be found for the tobacco leaf. The best tobacco leaf ever grown in Victoria has been raised by white men, and solely by means of white labour. I am prepared to admit that a quantity of tobacco has been grown in Victoria by Chinese ; but it is absurd to say that white men cannot grow it successfully. Europeans have been growing tobacco in the district which I represent for a considerable number of years, and the employment has been a profitable one, but there has not been a very strong disposition shown by Britishers to settle themselves down to intense cultivation of the soil. The time, however, is coming when necessity will compel them to do so, and we should give them every help and encouragement. So far the Britisher has not given his attention to gardening with The same success as Chinamen and foreigners, but simply because he would not apply himself to it. Europeans have grown tobacco successfully in the district I represent, and I shall only be too happy to give -honorable members who care to visit it, a splendid lesson as to the possibilities of success for white men in tobacco growing. The locality I am referring to is the King River Valley, and the honorable and learned member for Indi will be able to bear me out in what I have stated. As to the causes of the decrease in the area under cultivation for tobacco leaf, 1 am informed that so far as New South Wales is concerned, the manufacturers having .a monopoly, could fix whatever prices they liked for the leaf, and had the growers at their mercy. In Victoria, the reduction in the area under cultivation was brought about in the first instance, by the increase of the licence fees and the restriction placed upon the manufacture of tobacco. Subsequently there was a decrease in the margin between the excise and the import duties, and last and by no means least, an outbreak of disease in the leaf, known as blue mould, with which our scientists have not been able to cope, though I believe that one of them has now discovered a preventive for it. That was the' last straw on the back of the camel, but, notwithstanding this, I trust that honorable members will not lose sight of the important fact that in connexion with this item on the Tariff a splendid opportunity is afforded for giving a great impetus to the production of the tobacco leaf in Victoria. I venture to say that, when Australians begin to realize the possibilities connected with the growing of' tobacco leaf here, they will be prepared to make up from other sources the revenue that will be lost through tho falling off in tobacco importations. Where we now have hundreds and even thousands of acres yielding a poor living to one family, we should have hundreds of families following healthy occupations and making a good honest living. </para>

                    <para>- The position of the honorable and learned member for Laanecoorie is totally incomprehensible to me. He is opposed to any reduction of the duty upon imported tobacco, and he is also opposed to any increase of the excise. lie admits, with a candour that does him infinite credit, that he adopts this attitude in order to give to an exotic industry the protection which it requires to enable it to flourish. </para>

                        <para>- I think it can hardly be regarded as a natural industry. The honorable and learned member, with prophetic eye, looks forward to the time when locally-grown leaf will entirely take the place of imported leaf.

                        <para>- In considering this matter we should have regard to the experience of India. There they have a climate and soil which are more* favourable to the growing of tobacco than any we. have in Australia, but tobacco growing there has been successful to only a . limited extent, and notwithstanding the great improvements they have made both in . their methods of growing and of curing - and it is in the art of curing that the great, secret of profitable production lies - in spite of the fact that they have imported artisans from the United States to instruct them, the growers of India do not even now produce an article which can be for a moment compared with that produced in the United States, in the Philippines, and in Havana. The amount of protection which the tobacco industry will receive under the proposals of the Government-, exceeds even the usual desires of tha Minister for Trade and Customs in the direction of protection. Imported tobacco, will have to pay a duty of 3s. 6d. per lb., to compete with tobacco manufactured locally from imported leaf upon which a duty of ls. 6d., and a further excise duty of ls. per lb. has been paid. That gives the local manufacturer an advantage of ls. per lb. </para>

                        <para>- If they succeed in curing the locally grown leaf they will be able to make cigars of it. In India they have not attempted to make tobacco from the locally grown leaf, but they nuke trichinopoli and other big brands of cigars, though their Indian cigars are inferior to those of other places. If tobacco is manufactured locally from locally grown leaf the manufacturer will have an advantage of 2s. 3d. pep lb., and in the case of cigars and cigarettes, of 3s. 9d. and 4s. 3d. per lb. respectively. -Such a state of things seems to me to be monstrous. Tasmania is more vitally -effected by these duties than any other State of tho Commonwealth, and there must be 'some limit to the extent to which she should suffer through joining the union. She has already -lost a great part of her postal revenue ; she will have to take her share of the cost of securing a white Australia by increasing the sugar industries, and' she will suffer in many other ways. It is, therefore, the duty of every representative Of that State to do his best to see that the proposed restrictive duties are reduced, and that the difference between the import and excise duties on tobacco is decreased. If an amendment is moved to reduce the import duty to 3s. per lb., I shall support it in the interests of the consumers of tobacco throughout the Commonwealth, but especially in the interests of those of Tasmania. In the meantime I should be glad to hear what the Treasurer has to say in regard to tho proposal to charge duty upon " the weight of tags, labels, and other - attachments." </para>
