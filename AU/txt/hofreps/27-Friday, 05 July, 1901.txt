                        <para>- So far as can be ascertained, it seems that the carriage of fruit is entirely a matter of arrangement between the shippers and .the steam-ship owners. No contract is made with the Government. In Victoria, fruit intended for export, however, is all inspected by an officer of the Agricultural department before- shipment, and a 1 certificate given as to its condition before departure. The Commonwealth Government have not any control over such shipments or arrangements, however much they are in sympathy with the honorable member's object, but copies of the question .and answer will be sent to the Premiers of the States, who will no doubt take Such action as they may deem requisite. </para>

(2) I have already intimated that I have received a supply of publications, all of which are available for perusal on application. The numbers are sufficient for this purpose, hut not enough to allow of every member of each House having one copy of each publication. A number of copies of each were placed in the rooms occupied by the parties in each House, and more can be placed there on request. </para>

                        <para>- The matter referred to by the honorable member for South Australia is a very important one. It will be necessary to have uniform banking laws throughout the Commonwealth, but honorable members will realize that it is a very intricate subject, and that there must be careful inquiry before we proceed to deal with it. I am obtaining information from bankers as to their views, and also information in regard to the banking laws in Canada and other countries. It will be impossible to deal with the subject this session, but I hope to have a comprehensive Bill to submit early next session. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a question of the value of the telegraph line which has passed over with the rest of the Postal and Telegraph department to the control of the Commonwealth. That is not the point to which I am leading up. The point to which I am leading up is that South Australian enterprise in the construction of that line which connected all Australia with Europe, is deserving of consideration and recognition, irrespective of any other consideration at the hands of this Parliament. Of course at the time the line was constructed and the extension of the boundary was agreed to by the Imperial Parliament, the State of South Australia naturally enough expected to be able to settle and colonize that tract of country successfully. Unfortunately, owing to the various questions which have arisen since 1873 - questions of considerable importance to-day, such as black labour in Australia, - South Australia for many years past, in spite of having the country there - the climate and soil of which have been demonstrated to be capable of producing tropical and semi-tropical products of value - has, owing to the policy of which I am sure most of Australia will be proud - the policy of refusing to allow Asiatic labour to be employed in the northern portion of her possession - been the loser by many thousands of pounds each year. While on this particular point, perhaps, it would be as well for me to deal with the amount that South Australia has lost. Last year, I think I am nearly right in saying that the deficiency in the administration of the Northern Territory by South Australia was something like £90,000. In previous years it has aggregated from £50,000 to £60,000 and £70,000. And although I see some honorable members smile at the idea that one should desire to pass over an asset of such a questionable character, it is my desire to place before the House nothing but an absolutely candid and true position of the whole case. The difficulty that South Australia has had to contend with, owing to the adoption of the policy which I have mentioned, has been that, although she has admittedly a large tract of land in the northern portion of her territory, capable of growing sugar, rice, indigo, cotton, tobacco, and a host of other tropical products - which has been amply proven by the experiments at the Government Garden, and by other experiments by private individuals - the lack of suitable cheap labour, whether it be black or white - and I am certain honorable members will recognise that white labour in that degree of south latitude can hardly be successful - she has been unable to utilize that country. It is not necessary, in dis; cussing a motion such as this, to touch UP oI] the suitability of the labour in other branches of industry. Although I am absolutely of the opinion, after a residence of more than fifteen years in that country - that without black labour, suitable to the climate, it is impossible to cultivate any form of tropical products, I still admit that in regard to mining and pastoral pursuits, there is no difficulty whatever. </para>

                        <para>-.- That is a point which I am sure the honorable member will admit is now entirely beyond the control of South Australia. That is a question of policy for Federated Australia, and I think I am safe in saying that the settled policy of the United States of Australia is that the northern portion of the continent had better be left unutilized than that the future happiness and prosperity of our European races should be jeopardized. When I put my case in this way, it will be understood by honorable members that I do not desire in any way to cloud the issue or to influence their opinions by any threats as to what might be done if this portion of the continent were handed back to the Imperial Government. On that particular point, although the letters patent by which this territory was provisionally annexed to South Australia - I use the term " provisionally annexed " exactly as it stands - might raise some form of doubt, there can be little doubt in the minds of most of us that there would be no attempt on the part of the Imperial authorities to go back on the bargain which they made, or to belittle in any way the title of South Australia to this tract of country which they granted many years ago, and upon which that State has expended hundreds of thousands of pounds. Now, as to the financial position. In order not to delay honorable members too much upon private member's day, and to give as much information as I possibly can, I have had. a small map prepared showing, not only the geographical position of this tract of country, but also some details of its exports and imports extending over a long period of years. Honorable members will notice, for instance, that the export of gold for 1881 to 1899, to which I have previously alluded, amounted to 458,475 ozs., of a value of a trifle over £1,572,214. The exports of cattle, wool, sheep, horses, tin, copper ore, trepang, and pearl-shell brought the total up to a value of £2,414,832. </para>

                        <para>- They are principally employed in mining. The Malays and Japanese are principally employed in pearl-shelling. There is thus a total of 4,320 souls in a tract of country comprising. 335,000,000 acres, and extending for nearly 1,100 miles. Coming down to last year's record, which was certainly not as good as the previous year's in regard to mineral export and so forth, I find that the imports were valued at £129,488, or approximately £30 per head of the population, whilst the export of staple products was valued at £156,062, which is equivalent to 36 per head. For the whole population, including Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans - the Europeans being very much in a minority - the contribution to the Customs revenue is higher than any other portion of Australia, viz., £7 15s. per head. </para>

                        <para>- In 1873 or1874. But that is not the only thing. We had the construction of a line of railway authorized some years later, from Port Darwin to Pine Creek, traversing roughly about 150 miles, and supposed to serve the mining district. It was supposed also to be the northern section of a transcontinental line, and that it would eventually be connected with the line which honorable members will see stretches from the south to Oodnadatta. Unfortunately for the settlement of the northern end of the colony, the Government of the day consented to this line being constructed by what they termed " optional labour." I may say that by this regulation the South Australian Government saved some £80,000 in the contract price ; but the firm of C. and E. Miller, I think it was, who constructed the line, introduced thousands of Chinese to complete it, and when it was completed the Chinese left. Consequently the efforts at settlement in the country have been so far utter mistakes. And they should not be counted against the country in the consideration of the question I am now submitting to the House. </para>

                        <para>- I am very glad the climate did not affect the honorable member. The population consists of a few whites, a considerable number of Japanese, a good number of Chinese, a considerable number of aborigines, and a considerable number of criminals. When the Queensland Government want to get rid of any criminal who causes a great deal of trouble, they let him slip over to the Northern Territory, because he is there in company which just about suits him. Honorable members should understand that in places at the back of Pine Creek there is, perhaps, one of the most appalling populations in Australia. If any honorable member has an opportunity of going to Pine Creek and seeing the people there, he will almost wish he were back in Parliament. Port Darwin is the sort of place where the town is periodically blown into the sea, and left for the teredo to eat. There is a railway from Palmerston to Pine Creek, and, while the honorable member knows a little bit about the length of that line, he does not know anything about profits. The line was completed nine or ten years ago. </para>

                        <para>- In making a statement of the kind I am subject to correction, but at the same time I think I am perfect! y right in saying that the railway has never paid working expenses. Last year, or a year or two ago, when, singularly for Australia, a new jetty or something of the kind was built out of the railway earnings, the revenue from the railway was £10,000 behind. That I remember as a fact - I saw it stated at the time. That is about the position, so far as I can see, of the Northern Territory. Could any place be more useless to Australia from the local stand-point, with regard to which the honorable member had not a leg to stand on ? The more we inquire into- this matter from the stand-point of local value, the more sure we become that the Federal Parliament had better leave it alone. That will be the unanimous opinion of every man who looks into the question. But the main point, in regard to which the honorable member is light, is that the Northern Territory is close to Asia - is the back door to- Asia - and, therefore, whatever the cost may be, it must be taken over,preserved, and controlled by the Commonwealth Parliament. But in taking over a territory of this kind - and I would take it over for national reasons and not for local reasons- there must be an agreement reasonable to the Commonwealth made with the State Parliament of South Australia. It is not possible for any person to vote for such a proposal as the honorable member has made, and the honorable member must have known that when he tabled the motion. Although no local reasons may be advanced for taking over the Northern Territory, it being worth nothing, with millions of acres not worth a halfpenny per acre, still we have a national obligation which must be discharged.. I find in the Governor's speech a reference of this kind - .-. </para>
