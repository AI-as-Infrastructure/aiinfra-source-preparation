            <para>Honorable members will recollect that some time ago the committee passed Supply for a period of three months, which ended on the 30th September. It is now necessary for the Government to obtain further Supply in order that' the Treasurer may be able to make the necessary provision for the payment of salaries', and the various other claims that are made upon the Government from time to time. Some days ago I circulated, for the information of honorable members, a list of the amounts asked for by the various departments. As I said yesterday, however, I had had no opportunity of checking the requirements there stated, and when I saw the total amount I was satisfied that the heads of departments were asking for more than I was justified in requesting the House to grant. Yesterday I went as carefully as possible through the various demands that were made, and I have made a deduction of about a quarter of a million from the amount originally asked for. That, I think, was only right and fair to the House, because, while the Treasurer may be justified in asking for Supply sufficient for three months, he ought not to request more than that, or, at all events, he should not ask for more than will afford a reasonable margin beyond what he expects to expend - otherwise he might find that he had four months Supply instead of three. I took out some amounts that were not required to be paid before the 31st of December, I have reduced other payments, and I have only allowed for those amounts which I think it is absolutely necessary to pay during the currency of the three months. The total expenditure on votes comes to £3,636,577, and one-half of that amount is £1,818,288. In addition to this there were large arrears that came forward from the lost financial year, which would have to be paid either during the quarter which has passed or during the current quarter. The Estimates were somewhat increased last quarter, because these arrears necessarily had to be paid. The amounts that, in the ordinary course, would be paid before the 30th June to mail contractors and others are, as a rule, paid early in July. Supply was granted so late in June that it was impossible for me to pay these accounts before the 30th June, and, as honorable members are aware, under our Audit Act we have to close down sharp on the 30th June. These arrears amount to £246,899, and the total expenditure for the half-year, plus arrears, therefore, comes to £2,065,187. The first Supply amounted to £1,010,732, and now I am asking for £928,322, making a total of £1,939,054 or something under the total expenditure for the half-year, according to the Estimates. There are no extraordinary payments provided for. I have looked carefully over the list, and I have provided for just the ordinary expenditure. There are increases of salary provided for in the Estimates, but none of these increases will be paid until the Estimates have been finally dealt with. Honorable members will, I dare say, notice with pleasure that I have provided a considerable sum for maintenance and repairs - about £40,000 altogether - because complaints have been made to the department of Home Affairs with regard to the delay in carrying out repairs. I put down a very small amount for this work during the previous quarter, with the result that we have .not been able to go on as rapidly an we ought to have done, and we are therefore asking for a" larger amount now. It is somewhat late in October for us to bring down a Supply Bill, but circumstances over which we had no control compelled us to hold over the financial statement until this week. Therefore I am very anxious now to get this- Supply through both Houses to-day. The Senate does not sit until "Wednesday next, and unless I get the Bill through that Chamber to-day it will be Wednesday before it can bo passed and Thursday before I can get it assented to. In the meantime, there are claims which I am very anxious to pay at the earliest possible moment. I do not know that there are any really debatable matters in the Supply, and, therefore, I would ask honorable members to reserve any comments on the Estimates themselves until we have them before us - I hope in a month or six weeks' time at the outside. If, in the' meantime, honorable members desire any information in regard to any of the items my colleagues and I will be only too glad to supply it. </para>

                    <para>- I think that under the circumstances the committee will be disposed to fully accept the assurance the Treasurer has just given us. Under ordinary conditions this is a matter which might provoke considerable discussion, but inasmuch as the financial statement has just been delivered, and honorable members will soon have full opportunities of dealing with every subject which presents itself to us under this motion, I think we might well - unless some honorable member has some matter of great importance to mention allow this Supply to go through without any delay, in the interests of public business. I have a number of observations to make upon the financial administration of the Government but I can well postpone these until the general debate upon the financial statement of the Treasurer, when I think we shall have much larger scope, and where such a discussion would perhaps be more appropriate. Therefore, I am quite prepared to facilitate the Treasurer in getting Supply through at once. At the same time, I think honorable members will agree with me that this granting of a three months' Supply should not be made a precedent. The more regular course is to grant one month's Supply at a time, and we must not make it too easy for this or any other Government to dispense with the proper con'stitutional method of obtaining Supply. The Prime Minister has, however, fully recognised this, and has asked us, on this occasion as a matter of unusual urgency, to give this three months' Supply. Under the circumstances, I shall facilitate the passing of the Bill to-day. </para>

                    <para>- lt is not my desire to prevent the Supply from going through, but I should certainly like to have more information as to the expenditure that is provided for under the heading of " contingencies." In connexion with the Estimates, I find that the word " contingencies" covers an enormous amount of money ; and I think it is necessary that we should have the details dearly before us, so that we may know what we are voting. As a matter of fact, under "other expenditure" - which means new expenditure - " contingencies " represent a greater sum than salaries. I am not going to allow these items to pass, at any rate in the future, without further information than we have at the present time. Under the head of the House of Representatives, for instance, there is set down £1,500 for contingencies, and £1,554 for salaries. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the Treasurer will not find fault with me. I take his assurance that the item is for printing ; but, at the same time, it might cover a multitude of sins. . The same remark applies to the old expenditure ; but I am not taking so much exception to that, because in that case, the States have handed it over to us as a sort of legacy. Nevertheless, we shall, later on, require more information in regard to old expenditure ; and, as to new expenditure, the Treasurer would save time by giving full particulars of what is covered by contingencies. </para>

That can easily be brought out by debiting to loans a great deal o'f the expenditure which ought to come out of the revenue ; it is simply a matter of bookkeeping.

                        <para>- I do not want to be drawn off the track. I hope the committee will understand that this loan money is meant to cover a number of other tilings besides buildings. It is meant to cover a number of matters which, ordinarily and properly, in any good system of finance, ought to be provided for out of revenue. I have to warn honorable members that the very greediest  department with which we have to deal is the Defence department. </para>

                        <para>-iI do not say a word against the Minister for Defence, but, unless the right honorable gentleman is careful, he will be helpless in the hands of numerous commandants and others. Here we have about 1 9 pages of supply schedules, and about 13 are taken up with Defence. It is very significant that the most unprofitable department is that which occupies most of the space in the Federal Supply schedules. I fancy there will be a big discussion eventually on the question whether we are to give the Treasurer power to borrow for the purposes he has mentioned. I feel that we are getting into the old rut of financial policy which has injured several States of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is a policy of borrowing for purposes which should be defrayed from revenue. I did hope that in starting the career of this new Commonwealth, we should have had an announcement that the Government were going to use none of the loan moneys in this way, except in cases of absolute necessity and of emergency of an extreme sort, or where the expenditure was for remunerative investment. We cannot too soon lay down the principle that we will not allow future generations to be burdened with expenditure which we ought to pay ourselves. Honorable members here represent living persons - the existing electors of Australia - but we have none here representing the future electors of Australia. The worst of it is that the whole tendency is to lift the burden from the present taxpayers and put- it on future taxpayers. Whatever may be said in regard to the expenditure in other departments, there is no department which is so unremunerative, so costly, and so greedy, as the department of Defence. I intend to object to any loan moneys being raised or applied for the purposes of defence. I am not speaking at present of the permanent forts, which may present an exceptional case from which future generations can reap a benefit; but in the Budget statement there is a clear intimation, which we ought to weigh well, that the Treasurer intends to throw on to the £1,000,000 loan, a number of items of expenditure which properly, and in the eye of any business man, ought to fall on revenue to be obtained by our own payments. We have a trust not only for the present taxpayers 'but for future taxpayers, and we ought to see that we do not allow the position to be glossed over. It is very easy, by throwing the expenditure on loans, to make out that we are keeping within the £300,000 limit. </para>

                    (East Sydney). - I hope we shall make up our minds whether we are going to discuss the whole financial policy of the Government while the Senate is waiting to pass a Supply Bill in order to pay salaries, or whether we intend to reserve our observations until we can deal with the proposals of the Government at one time. The Opposition are not delaying the progress of the Bill in any way. I could easily make a speech on the subject, but I shall have an opportunity of doing so in two or three days' time. I hope honorable members will allow this general discussion to stand over until we are dealing with the general financial policy and proposals of the Government. I am quite as much in earnest in this matter as the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but I feel that there is no time, under existing circumstances, to enter into such questions, and I should like to see the rest of the time to-day devoted to important measures now before the House.

                    <para>- I subscribe to all that the leader of the Opposition has said, but I have to complain that there are no loan funds available for necessary public works. I believe in every word of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who has uttered a caution which is wise and opportune ; and I hope with him that we shall not resort to loan funds except for purely reproductive purposes. I want to call attention to a very serious disability which the services of the whole of the States are labouring under by reason of their being no loan funds available at the present time. The Post-office, we know, is a constantly expanding department, in which fresh expenditure is continuously required on permanent reproductive works. But there are no loan funds available for expenditure in that direction, and the consequence is that these works are entirely suspended. The Postmaster-General and the Treasurer should, on taking office, either have made arrangements with the States to carry on the normal expenditure on these new services, or have themselves raised a loan for the purpose. I do not care how small a loan it might have been, but there should be a fund out of which the services could have been continued. Honorable members will perhaps realize my point by an illustration afforded in my own electorate, and that instance is multiplied in other electorates. In the fruit-growing districts in my electorate, those engaged in that industry have been trying for some time to get connected with Sydney by telephone. All arrangements for this were made last year. A guarantee was asked from the fruit-growers by the Government, and that guarantee was forthcoming, and a deposit paid in January. Notwithstanding that fact, no work has yet been done. </para>

Now, honorable members are told that there are no funds to enable the work to be carried out until loan moneys are available. The same condition of affairs prevails in regard to urgently required additions to post-offices. At one place, with which I am acquainted, the population has of late considerably increased, with the result that people cannot gain access to the local post-office during certain hours of the day, to say nothing of transacting any business. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General says that this expenditure must be incurred, and will be incurred as soon as loan funds are available. If the Government, through their own mouth-piece, declare that these works are absolutely necessary, surely some arrangement should have been made with the Public Works departments in the various States for the continuance of extension operations in connexion with post-offices. I hope that some arrangement will be speedily arrived at which will enable these works to be put in hand. There is another matter to which I should like to direct attention. In New South Wales I believe that the line repairers are regarded as temporary hands. They have not those privileges which attach to the permanent servants of the State. </para>

I desire to know what is being done in reference to the Federal capital site. This matter seems to be in a most nebulous condition. No one seems to have any precise knowledge regarding it. The Minister for Some Affairs says that he is doing all he can to facilitate the selection of the site. On the other hand, the Premier of New South Wales declares that he has already done all that can possibly be done to assist in its early selection. In other words, he has collected all available information and presented it to the Minister for Home Affairs, with a view of expediting a decision in regard to this matter. What is the cause of the delay in the department of the Minister for Home Affairs ? </para>

Except for the vague statements which appear from time to time in the newspapers, as emanating from the Minister, nobody seems to know that anything of a tangible character is being done, and I therefore hope that he will see his way clear to make a statement to the House concerning the position which this very important matter occupies at the present time </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with a good deal of what has been said by the honorable member for Parramatta regarding the Postal department. The delay in erecting new buildings and in extending post-offices which now provide insufficient accommodation for thegeneralpublic,.has.given rise to keen disappointment in New South Wales. I do not blame the Government for this delay, because they have had no opportunity of getting the public service into line. Whenever an attempt is made to do that, it seems to me that honorable members are expected not to voice the wants of their constituents, but to sit quietly by and allow some high officials - as in the case of Mr.Outtrim the other day -to do what they choose. These officials are permitted to put their constituents to very great inconvenience, and a hubbub is created the moment an honorable member expresses disapproval of what has been done. I wish to enter my protest against the. actions of some of these gentlemen. I do not single out Mr.Outtrim particularly. Many officials in New South </para>

                        <para>- I shall be very pleased to furnish the Treasurer with particulars. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction caused by the tyranny of some of these officers, and by what is regarded as favoritism on their part. Some of the men are afraid to make representations on the subject lest they should suffer for them, and I think this is the proper place to ventilate such matters. While we can understand that the Government are not to blame,inasmuch as they have half-a-dozen departments to administer under very difficult circumstances, pending the passage of the Public Service Bill, nevertheless I think some of these officials should be pulled up with a round turn. As the result of information which I have received during the last two or three days, I propose to supply the Postmaster-General with the names of some of these officials. I have no doubt that the Minister will take steps to let them know that they do not own this country, and that the department is not run for their especial benefit. I do not wish to go any further than that. Many of these men require only a little " shaking up," and we shall soon have some changes made. I agree also with some of the remarks which have been made upon the question of defence. When the Defence estimates come before us we should take care to see that men in country districts who desire to form rifle clubs or corps of the Australian Horse and other regiments of that description receive some consideration. Very little difficulty has been experienced in securing the expenditure of large sums of money by the Defence department in the principal centres of population. I hope we shall now give some attention to the residents of country districts who desire to train themselves, so that they may be prepared to fight for their country should occasion arise. To my mind it is an alarming fact that, while hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent on city forces, no attempt is made to secure scouts or men with a knowledge of the coast line, who would be invaluable in time of invasion. Something in that direction should be done, and when the vote for the Defence department is before us I hope we shall take the matter into consideration. These men in the country districts are ready to train themselves at their own expense, and the Government should facilitate the carrying out of their desires. I would welcome the formation of a corps of scouts, and of men having a knowledge of the coast line. It is unnecessary to make any further reference to the question of a citizen soldiery, but before I resume my seat I desire to say a few words on the question of the site for the Federal capital. </para>

All that the people of Southern Monaro desire is that honorable members shall be given a fair opportunity of judging of the merits of the respective sites. The newspaper paragraphs referring to a proposed parliamentary picnic in connexion with the inspection of sites must be taken with a very large grain of salt. It seems to me, however, that there could be no better way of enabling Parliament to come to a proper decision than by allowing honorable members to visit the various sites. The experts who have gone into the question of water supply, climate, and other matters should he with us when we make the inspection, and with their statements before use we shall be enabled to come to an early decision. </para>

                        <para>- We know, of course, that there is a very strong inclination on the part of honorable members to settle down in the comfortable quarters provided for us here. Many have said that we have not been made welcome, but I do not think that is so. I know of no honorable member who has not settled down comfortably here, and who has not been treated with courtesy and kindness by the people of Victoria. The statement that we have not is only a libel, fomented by persons who have certain objects to serve. Some of the suggested sites are no larger than a garden, with nothing but barren country about them. Honorable members should see them for themselves, and after the inspection has been made we should take a vote on the question as speedily as possible. I entertain no doubt as to the site which will be selected, but I am willing to bow to the decision of the majority. There is no reason why we should visit any place other than those recommended by the New South Wales commissioner. That gentleman has expended a great deal of time and trouble inquiring into the respective claims. Some 30 or AO sites were submitted to him, and he has selected three or four, the merits of which in his opinion stand out conspicuously. If we visit those places we shall have very little difficulty in coming to a determination. Once the location of the Federal Capital has been agreed upon, we should proceed with the erection of temporary quarters, so that the Federal Parliament may settle down with as little delay as possible, in what is to be its permanent home. I hope the visit will be made at an early date, and that every facility will be afforded honorable members to come to a right decision. </para>

                        <para>- That does not affect the question. The honorable member was told by the Prime Minister, on the first occasion, that the work could not be carried out. A similar reply was given by the Minister representing the Postmaster-General, but as soon as articles appeared in the honorable member's newspaper, and pressure was brought to bear, the money was found. That is not fair to honorable members from other States, who have equally pressing claims. </para>

                    <para>- I quite sympathize with honorable members who have complained that they cannot get reasonable replies to the requests which they make upon the Postal department. No doubt the transfer of the departments from the States to the Federal Government has been responsible for some of the delays, but now that federal matters are getting under weigh, it is time that the affairs of the departments were conducted in a businesslike way. While I quite agree with what has been said as to the necessity for economy on the part of the Federal Government, I think it will be false economy not to meet reasonable public requirements in the way of post and. telegraph facilities. I do not contend that the Federal Government should be called upon to carry out any particular work that might have been promised by a State Government after it was known that the post and telegraph service was to be taken' over by the Commonwealth, but if what has been stated by the honorable member for Bourke is true, and favoritism has been shown to one honorable member who happens to be supported by a big newspaper, I think that honorable members have not been treated fairly. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say I believe it. In. my own case I. have had a distinct refusal on the part of the Postmaster-General to carry out a work that was promised by the Government of New South Wales prior to the transfer of the department to the Federal Government. I was prepared to accept that position on the understanding that general economy was to be practised, but I shall not be satisfied if any. exceptions are made: If the Lyne administration had met the Parliament of New South Wales during the last twelve months that work would have been carried out, as the plans had been drawn and the work authorized prior to the date at which it was known that the department was to be taken over by the Commonwealth. I shall be quite ready to join with other honorable members in putting: down anything like favoritism, because I think that would be the very worst form of political patronage that could be. introduced) into this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is to be hoped that all such suggestions will be favourably considered, at any rate during the operation of the bookkeeping clauses. These people in the back, country are quite cut off from the advantages of civilization, except by the communicating link of the Post-office. They were the most enthusiastic throughout the Commonwealth in favour of federation, and some of' them, when the Bill was submitted, travelled hundreds of miles in order to record their votes in favour of unity. But the very first intimation they get after the accomplish of federation, is a notification from, the Government threatening to remove their one link to civilization. The only public money ever spent on these people, so as to induce them to remain in those outlying districts, has been that devoted to the postal services, and I ask that, at any rate, during the operation of- the bookkeeping, clauses, no alterations be made contrary to the wishes of: the States Governments. </para>

                    <para>. - One or two expressions have been used on which I think it is necessary I- should say a few words. The honorable' member- for Bourke drew attention to the provision of postal conveniences at Tarcoola, and I refer to this because those matters arc dealt with- mainly in the department of Home Affairs, which has the carrying out of" all public works. In this particular case, I found; on making inquiry, that * promise had been made to provide the desired accommodation. I- am not sure that a sum of money for the purpose was- not placed' on&gt; the estimates in South Australia. Tarcoola, is in very exceptional circumstances as a new mining centre1; good returns have been obtained, and fell© place lias- no postal convenience at all. The circumstances are very exceptional; and' it would seem hard if the Federal Government were to refuse to carry out a work of the kind desired: </para>

I unhesitatingly say that in- every State the Federal Government feel bound to carry out these works pretty well in the same ratio as in the past, especially in new mining centres, where development is so necessary. But honorable members must not forget that we have not had time to ascertain exactly what is required in the various States. </para>

                        <para>- I know the case to which the honorable member refers ; and so- far as- I understand . the matter,, the Postal department will halve to give up the idea of running this and similar services on commercial lines. No railway would ever be built if it were expected to pay from the start, and the same remark applies to postal and telegraphic matters. These services are for the convenience of the public, and in no more than one or two of the States have they previously paid expenses. In regard to the Preston, case,. I do not know the reason, though no doubt there- is a reason, why that work has not been proceeded with. Claims come into the department of Home Affairs, and in almost every case where the postal authorities recommend a work, the money necessary has been placed on the Estimates. But there are bundles of claims in regard to which the postal authorities do not recommend the construction of works, and honorable members, with their past experience in the various States, must acknowledge that claims are sometimes made, on no very solid foundation, for the expenditure of large sums of money. If the Commonwealth is to husband its resources, and not bring down, for the approval of the House, proposals- for largo and undue- expenditure we- must be careful not to carry out works- which are not required in the interests) or for the convenience, of the public. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government has laid down the rule, and I think it is a good rule, that in regard to promises made by the States before the establishment of the Commonwealth, the Government of the Commonwealth will carry out the works unless these have actually been commenced by the States. In every case where it was possible, I have had an investigation made, and if it appears to me that a work should be carried out, provision is made on the estimates. One honorable member has asked why the States should not be allowed to carry out these works. I may say I am making arrangements with the works department in the various States to, in some instances, borrow their officers to carry out works ; but if we are to have a Federal control of expenditure, I, as head of the construction department in the Commonwealth, must know what moneys are being expended, and I shall certainly not give up my right to have that knowledge. Where works have been commenced by a State department, those works are being completed, but in other cases works will be carried out by the Federal Government, so that we may control the expenditure. The work referred to by the honorable member for Newcastle is one that I was very anxious to see carried out. The honorable member did not define exactly what the work was, but I suppose he meant the addition of a tower to the post-office in Newcastle. </para>

                        <para>- The people of a city should not be required to erect part of a building which is to be transferred to the Commonwealth. In this particular case I do not know whether it was £18,000 or £28,000 that was voted by the State Parliament for the erection of the building. But there was a sum voted, and, though the building is a very fine one, it is spoiled by not having a tower such as should form part of a building of the kind. I believe that the sum required to complete the work without the tower is some £8,000 or £8,800 ; but when I made inquiry as to the reason why a tower was not to be built, I found that the plan on which the estimate was based, did not provide for an addition of the kind. When I approached the Minister of Works in New South Wales in the matter, he pointed out that the work had proceeded so far that it would cost £2,000 to pull down a part in order to form a foundation for the tower, and that the latter would cost from £8,000 to £10,000. </para>

                        <para>- I think some £33,000 is to be spent on a post-office, with a tower, in Hobart. The honorable member for Parramatta referred to the difference between the status of the line-repairers in New South Wales and that of those in Victoria. This matter was brought under my notice upon one occasion in New South Wales. No doubt there is a difference in the status of these two sets of men, who are performing precisely similar work. That is an anomaly which cannot be continued under the Federal Government. I have said that it will be rectified, and I repeat my statement. We cannot have one set of men doing precisely similar work to another set, and yet holding an inferior status. I am merely awaiting the passage of the Public Service Bill through the Senate to have this matter and a number of others put right. As soon as that measure is passed, I shall take the opportunity of appointing persons who are qualified to grade the whole of the service upon one system. </para>

                        <para>- My policy is one of levelling up, if that can bts done, and I believe it can. But the honorable member must not forget that, in dealing with the whole of the service, regard must be paid to the amount of work which is done in the different States. In a very small State, for example, officials may 710t have to perform anything like the same amount of work that is required of officials occupying similar positions in the larger States. I do not know that the same salaries can be paid to officials in States where there is comparatively small responsibility and work as are paid to those where the responsibilities and work are heavy. Probably all grades will be placed upon the same footing where possible, but officials who have less responsibility and work than others who occupy similar positions in other States will have to be placed in a different grade. I am not going to level down. </para>

                        <para>- I am not speaking of matters of that sort. The telegraph line-repairers will all be placed upon the same level. Where officers are engaged in performing the same duties they must, if possible, be put upon the same footing. Some honorable members have complained - and I notice similar complaints in the press - that certain public works are not being carried out. Only yesterday I was looking through the applications received from various States for works of this character. The applications from Victoria are very numerous, but they relate chiefly to small works, such as the repairing of buildings, &amp;c. Already a large number of works are being proceeded with in this State. From the other States the applications have not been so numerous. My desire is to arrange with the Public Works departments of the various States to lend us their officers to supervise any works which we may undertake, at least for a time. I shall make an arrangement for the payment of part of these officers' salaries until the works of the Commonwealth have been advanced to that stage when it will become imperative that we should have a large department of our own. In the interim, however, so long as the department for Home Affairs can exercise the control necessary to safeguard the efficient carrying out of our public works, it is far better to make an arrangement with the States which will not cost the Commonwealth much for supervision, than to appoint a big staff in each State. The staff which I have at present is ridiculously small for the amount of work that is being done. </para>

                        <para>- New South Wales has been sick at heart all along. As soon as it is possible to fix. the capital site it will be fixed. It will take a considerable time - certainly some years - to complete the necessary buildings upon that site. I am inclined to think that we shall not have to build on. a very extensive scale at first. I saw a gentleman from the Congress of America the other day, and asked him the cost of the buildings at Washington-. He told me that the cost of those buildings was £20,000,000. That is a very large sum of money to expend. We shall have to go reasonably slow. I am hopeful that before the termination of the present session honorable members will have an opportunity of inspecting the capital sites which are in the running. It would be nonsense to inspect a large number of sites which cannot possibly be in the running. But those from Albury onwards I think ought to be inspected by honorable members. It is impossible to give a definite promise, but before we separate this session, I hope that honorable members will be able to take a ten days' trip to the chief sites. They would thus acquire a much better knowledge than they could otherwise bring to bear upon? the final settlement of this matter. </para>

                <para>SirWILLIAMLYNE. - I am speaking for the Government. In reference to the remarks of the honorable member for Bourke, I wish to say that I have always held it to be the privilege of an honorable member to unearth and rectify any abuse. I held so in New South Wales, and: never refused to see any member who had a complaint of a reasonable character to make. Of course, I recognise that there is a vast difference between' that and the practice of going to a Minister with every trivial matter, and' thus interfering unduly with heads of departments. But the Ministerial head of a department has a right to see that wrongs are rectified. It is his duty to do so. If he is not aware of the existence of such wrongs, who is better qualified to bring them under his notice than a Member of Parliament, who is the guardian of the public interests ? The honorable member for Bourke was unquestionably right in endeavouring to get justice done in the case to which he referred. I know of an instance in which a man had his character blasted till a Member of Parliament embraced the opportunity of exposing the wrong which had been committed, and of insisting upon a searching investigation, with the result that the man's character was thoroughly rehabilitated. </para>

                    <para>- I must appeal to honorable members to allow this Supply Bill to go through at" once. By delaying its passage we are not acting fairly to the Senate. I would point out that unless we get it passed to-day the public servants cannot be paid at the end of the month. I am aware that there is a motion of no confidence pending. Whilst that motion is pending the Senate will not proceed with business. We have been discussing this measure for two and a half hours, and I ask if it is fair to send it up to the Senate at the last moment, and expect that Chamber to swallow it without any opportunity being given for debate? Surely grievances' such as have been made by honorable members can well stand over till the Estimates are under consideration. The Senate must have a reasonable amount of time to deal with this Bill. That reasonable time will not be afforded if honorable members of this House insist upon discussing for two or three hours matters which might well stand over till the Estimates are being considered in detail. </para>

                        <para>- I know that the Treasurer has been overworked, and on that account he is entitled to the sympathy of the House. But I object to allowing what the Treasurer calls " little matters " to: pass unnoticed, as they may be important matters to the people we represent. The only opportunity which honorable members have of ventilating their grievances is upon an occasion of this sort. It is not a little thing that districts and important towns should' be deprived of telegraphic communications, as is the case in one portion of Western Australia at the present time. </para>

                        <para>-I hope that the principle laid down by the Minister for Home Affairs will be preserved ; that is to say, that the ratio of expenditure in. the Postal and Telegraph, department observed by the various States prior to federation will be maintained. It would be a monstrous thing to deprive new towns or settlements of postal or telegraphic facilities upon which their very existence depends. It is unfair to deal with their claims in the same way as those of established towns, which: merely want new towers on their post-offices, such as the demand put forward by the honorable member for Newcastle know of a town in Western Australia where nearly £4,000 per month is being distributed in wages. It has a. population of between 300 and 400 people, and though a telegraph line passes a point within three miles of the place, the Postal department of Western Australia refuses to recommend that the line be extended to that township. </para>

                        <para>-I refer to the township of Euro. It is one of the new towns which have sprung up in Western Australia of recent years, and it is certainly on the fringe of civilization. The people have enough hardship to contend with there in battling against the forces of nature without being placed at the disadvantage of being refused telegraphic communication. Their request has been refused absolutely by the officials in Perth. Therefore I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs; who, I think, said he would act on the report of the department-- </para>

                        <para>- Well, then, I must have misunderstood the right honorable gentleman. From the very outset the Opposition have given the Government every assistance in the transaction of business ; in fact, we have been a model Opposition, and the Treasurer should not have blamed us as he has done. The Minister for Home Affairs, who has charge of the selection of the site for the Federal Capital, has said to-day that he will deal with the question, but he has given no more definite promise than that which he made three months ago. The people of New South Wales are tired of the delay that has taken place in dealing with this matter, and I trust the Minister will organize some plan for keeping the spirit of the bond entered into with that State. I hope we shall come to a definite decision this session. I do not intend to air the grievances of my constituency, because they are too numerous; but I could not allow this occasion to pass without urging upon the Minister the desirability of proceeding at once to the selection of a site for the Federal Capital. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendments which have been made by the Senate are, I think, for the most part such as can be accepted without any hesitation. The first amendment is in clause 1, omitting the first day of October, and substituting the first day of December, as the date on which the Act shall come into operation. The second amendment is in clause 10, from which it is proposed to omit the word " seventeen." and insert " eighteen." We had fixed seventeen as the age at which telegraph messengers should cease to act hi that capacity, and should retire from the service if no other occupation could be found for them. The Senate have raised the age to eighteen, and have thus given the lads another year in which they may act as telegraph messengers. At the end of the clause it is proposed to insert the words " but may be eligible to be appointed to some other position in the public service." This means that if, at the time a lad reaches the age of eighteen, there is a vacancy in some other branch of the service for unskilled youths, he is to have a chance for it. </para>

The next amendment accepts all that is contained in the definition of a newspaper in clause 26a, except the amendment that was inserted at the instance of the honorable member for Bourke. I doubt if it is worth while insisting finally upon that, as there are other means of attaining the same end. The next amendment is in clause 27, in which we proposed to omit the words "seditious and blasphemous." The word " blasphemous " has been given up by the Senate, but they desire to retain the word " seditious." </para>

                        <para>- In addressing the House with respect to this Bill, I wish to direct attention chiefly to the question whether we should grant the postponement that has been asked for, and refer -the matter to a (Royal commission in the way suggested -by the honorable member for Oxley. It seems to me that we should decide this matter now, once and for all, as I fail to see how any postponement .would be of any advantage -to those engaged in the sugar industry. The cry for an extension of time is simply a repetition of the demands that were made in 1-884, 1686, and in 1-889. </para>

                            <para>- ?es. If .there is a large vested interest in the sugar industry, that interest -will not grow less in the future, and if we cannot deal with it now, it will be more difficult to legislate regarding it in ten years' time. I am totally opposed to the proposal 'to remit the matter to a commission -for further inquiry, because sufficient information has been placed before honorable members to -enable them to come to a decision at once. Two commissions have inquired into this question, one in 1885, and another in 1 889, and -the reports of both of them were simply directed to asking for more time. Any further inquiry at -this juncture would fail to enlighten us beyond the extent to which we have already been informed by -the speeches made during this debate, and by the facts and figures, derived from various reliable sources, which have been placed before us. It has been urged that we should be very careful in dealing with this question, because sugargrowing is practically the national industry of Queensland, and our action is being protested against by the Queensland Government. If I thought that that Government, as at present constituted, represented the people of the whole of Queensland, -I should perhaps be prepared to attach some weight to their views. But when we know that, under their State laws, a majority of the people of Queensland were not represented, and when we compare the result of the State election with the result of the Federal campaign, which was fought entirely on this one question - and when we consider that there have been returned a vast majority of honorable members from that -State in favour of the abolition of kanaka labour - I am inclined to think that the Federal elections represent -the voice of Queensland. The first time the people of Queensland had an opportunity of giving effect to one man one vote, they proclaimed with one voice the abolition of this traffic. Some honorable members who have spoken in support of the continuance of kanaka labour, have said that the kanakas are well treated, and that the regulations are properly carried out, and, further, that the kanakas are harmless and peaceful citizens of the State. But if honorable members examine for a moment the reports of the Royal commission, they will find that no fewer than eight vessels were cruising with a view of obtaining kanakas,and that in almost every case kidnapping obtained to some extent, while, in the other cases, the islanders were deluded into entering the agreements. </para>

                    <para>That is only one of the eight cases, and there is no suggestion of ancient history about that. At that time every leading newspaper throughout Australia commented on this traffic, and even in England attention was drawn to the fact that slavery was being carried on in Australasia. Call it what we like - smother it up as we like - this is what the American people called slavery many years ago. If that be a correct position to assume, I cannot understand, after the experience of America in dealing with black labour, how honorable members can stand up in the Federal Parliament and justify the continuance of such a trade in what is supposed to be a Christian country. </para>

                            <para>- That is so ; and here the kanakas were kidnapped in , the islands, as the blacks were kidnapped in Africa for the slave market in America. There may be a difference in the method, but the principle is exactly the same, and if it was slavery in the one instance, it is slavery in the other. We have practically had admissions on the floor of the House that the sugar industry cannot be carried on by white labour - that such work is the work of slaves. If that be so, 'I do not think there is any need to argue the point further. As it presents itself to me, it is a question of cheapness - a question of labour, and nothing else. It is futile to tell a working man, who knows all about the subject, that it is harder for a white man to work in the cane-fields than to work in a railway cutting in such a climate as that of Queensland. No work is harder in a tropical climate than that in a railway cutting, or anywhere else in railway construction. The carrying of huge iron rails in a hot climate like that of Queensland is much harder labour than I, at least, would care to perform, and the same may be said of shovel work in an open cutting, where there is no chance of getting any breeze. The white man has done all the pioneer work in the tropical portions of Queensland. He went there when the climate and general conditions were much worse than they are to-day ; and we know that as a country is opened up and railway communication and other agencies of civilisation are brought to bear, the work in such climates becomes easier. With other honorable members, I think that the Queensland people accepted federation believing that a federal Parliament would pronounce on this question with no uncertain voice. I believe that the majority of the people of Queensland accepted federation with the full knowledge, or with the hope, that the Federal Parliament would once and for all abolish kanaka labour. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I say most distinctly that we have one continuous stream of public expression of opinion on the part of Queenslanders in favour of the abolition, and apparently the immediate abolition, of coolie labour. But we must remember that at that time the Act of 1885 was in force, and everybody was looking forward to the termination of the traffic in 1890. In 1892, for the reasons that I have mentioned, what has been called the " Kanaka bridge" was built. That structure has given us a great deal of trouble, and I think it is time it was swept away by the current of public opinion that is flowing, undoubtedly, in one strong continuous stream all over Australia. I have demonstrated to my own mind, and I hope to the satisfaction of honorable members, that, so far as the possibility of carrying on this work is concerned, it is an admitted fact. We are asked to postpone this legislation. I have already given some reasons why I think we should not, and they are fundamental reasons. It would amount to an admission on our part that would be converted into a precedent, and would be used more forcibly than any argument I have heard used at the present time. I have said that there is a precedent in history the repetition of which in Australia I am very anxious to avoid. We are told that if the planters can only, by means of the progress of invention or by some unexpected event, secure a device for doing the work more cheaply than white labour can do it, they will be ready to surrender kanaka labour. Every one familiar with the history of slavery in the United States knows perfectly well how one little invention accentuated the whole difficulty, and brought about a condition of things that led to enormous trouble at a time when it was thought the slave trade was going to die away. I am not alluding to the original compromise in the Constitution, which was considered to be necessary in order to achieve federation. We have no such excuse as America had, because we have not to stoop to such compromises. We have got our Constitution without it. I am alluding to the fact that when cotton was first grown in the southern States, it was difficult, indeed, to separate the seeds from the cotton, and its supply to England and the other countries was comparatively limited. It was thought, therefore, that slavery would die a natural death, but one day an inventive American devised the cotton gin. </para>

                        <para>- The case for Queensland has been sufficiently strongly put on this question -without my going over ground which has already been trodden. But there are one or two aspects of the question which do not appear to have been dealt with. The Australian Commonwealth, and the State of Queensland in particular, will no doubt 'feel very grateful for the weighty consideration that has been given to this matter by the parliamentary representatives of the Commonwealth. Such a speech as we have just listened toby the honorable and learned member for Indi must convince the most prejudiced persons on the other side that this matter is not being decided without due and weighty consideration. On this question of the abolition of Polynesian immigration and its employment in Queensland, I take up a somewhat stronger position than even that taken up by the 'Government to-day. But I believe that the proposals of the Government are a most reasonable compromise ; and, after all the evidence we have had brought to bear, showing that this traffic has been considered a matter of temporary convenience for many years past, I cannot see how there can be any objection to those proposals, even on the part of the most earnest advocate of the continuance of this traffic. _ Here I should like to make reference to a vote I gave a few nights ago. That vote was called in question, but I must say that I do not think that even the honorable member for Maranoa can question my desire for a " white Australia." My desire, however, is to have a " white Australia" brought about as quickly as possible. I do not Want to see 500 Japanese rushed into 'the country by Burns, Philp, and Company, while we are waiting Imperial sanction to any Bill we may pass. I want to see finality as -early as possible. I'f we think afterwards that our rights of self-government have been infringed or interfered with, we -can attend 'to that matter later on. First of all, let us see that we preserve our Commonwealth against the introduction of these people. In reply to an interjection I said that I should be able to answer my constituents on this question, and so I shall. I do not need to fear them. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say. The inference drawn from this fact is that the kanakas, who resemble each other very closely, rush out of the cane-fields and commit outrages, the authors of which it is thus impossible to trace. Despite all attempts to Christianize him the kanaka is still a savage. We cannot eradicate his savage instincts in one or two generations. I have in my mind a kanaka whom I have known for over 30 years. He is a member of the Salvation Army and beats the drum. He stands in the streets and exhorts the white people to repentance, and thinks that he is better than the Europeans. But he is a savage none the less. During the course of this debate the reason has been given why the white people permit certain low classes of women to inhabit the towns in which these kanakas are congregated. I have not been sparing in my denunciation of the Chinese quarters of Melbourne and Sydney, but there are canker spots in Queensland just as there are elsewhere. Where the kanakas are brought here without their women we may depend upon it that there will be a degree of immorality which we in our civilization do not desire to see perpetuated in Australia. Some honorable members have asked for an extension of the period during which the planters shall be able to employ kanakas, in order that the planters may have an opportunity of accommodating themselves to the new set of circumstances. I admired much of that was said the other day by the honorable member for Wentworth. But he pleads for time. I should like to ask that honorable member, as well as the honorable member for Kooyong and the honorable member for Oxley, whether, if they saw one of their loved ones suffering from a cancer, they would delay the surgical operation which would be necessary to cut the cancer away? Certainly not ! They would permit the operation to be performed, and afterwards by tender nursing would endeavour to heal the wound which the knife had made. That is what the Government propose to do. They desire to cut away this cancerous growth from the sugar industry, and afterwards, by offering practically a bonus for sugar grown by white labour, they hope to heal the wound which has been made. They have no desire to kill the sugar industry, but merely wish to get rid of an evil which threatens the life of the Commonwealth. I am proud that I gave a vote the other night in support of a Government which I know to be earnest in its endeavour to bring about a white Australia. I am not a bit ashamed of that vote. The evils regarding the recruiting traffic have already been referred to. Some honorable members say - " Let us continue the recruiting for five years " ; others plead for an extension to seven years ; and others again favour limiting the period to ten years. I am pleased to admit that the evils of recruiting have been very much diminished of late years. But they have not been entirely abolished, nor can they be. Where many men - some of them utterly unscrupulous - are out upon the ocean plying a trade which brings them gain, we cannot keep them all honest. We may send inspectors to the islands, but we cannot always get honest inspectors. I have in my hand a letter from a man who has been on the " black-birders." He writes- </para>

                    <para>- I am not going to offer any opposition to the motion, but I think it is a very great pity that the change from seventeen to eighteen years has been made. These youths will be employed in the department until they are eighteen years of age, and it will then be too late for them to learn any trade. While I do not want to hinder the passing of this measure, I think this amendment is an indication that honorable members of another place are not aware of the seriousness of their proposal. </para>

The paragraph deals with newspaper supplements, and was debated by us at great length. As honorable members will recollect, the question relates entirely to the letterpress of these supplements, and the provision, as finally modified by us, was that the letterpress should be set up within the Commonwealth.In view of the importance of the discussion here, I think we should ask the Senate to reconsider its decision. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General appears to be willing to swallow anything, and he thinks the committee has an equally capacious windpipe. I am certainly not going to let this matter pass without a protest. I disagreed with the Government proposal before, as a protectionist dodge. After three or four weeks' consideration, I repeat that this is a protectionist dodge, which will do the Government no good, nor will it help the parties concerned. The Attorney-General is always willing apparently to do everything he possibly can to impose some little protection on the unfortunate people of this Commonwealth. When this matter was being debated by us on a former occasion he actually consented to an amendment, suggested by the honorable member for Bland, that supplements printed from matrices set up by linotype should not be deemed a supplement to a newspaper for the purposes of this measure. It is a difficult matter to explain to honorable members who do not understand the technique of the printing trade, but when I pointed out that we do not print from matrices, but from the stereotyped plates cast from them, the proposal was reluctantly withdrawn. I hope honorable members will coincide with the amendment made by the Senate. I shall divide the committee on this question, if necessary, for I think we ought to have a little respect for the mature judgment of legislators in another place. </para>

                        <para>- We have to concede something to them. They have conceded a good deal to us. We need not accept their objections to the use of the words "seditious" and "blasphemous," and I feel sure that such a lover of liberty as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports would not do so. If it could have been foreseen that the honorable member was to be elected for Melbourne Ports, what a splendid sarcasm that man must have possessed who named' that electorate, for it is now represented by an honorable member who does not want a port. He thinks apparently that a harbor is one of the mistakes of Providence, and would erect a barrier across every port in Australia. I hope the committee will see fit to respect the judgment of the Senate, who have conceded many things to us, and have shown a very good spirit towards this branch of the Legislature. </para>

                    SMITH (Macquarie). I hope the Government will not insist upon any alteration in the clause as amended by the Senate. When this matter was discussed in the committee previously, the question of free-trade and protection was unnecessarily raised by the Government supporters. It was not right to introduce an amendment importing the fiscal issue into a purely machinery Bill of this sort. The Attorney-General led honorable members to believe that he would accede to the Senate's amendment upon our amendment, and many honorable members have left the chamber believing that no difficulty would be raised in regard to it. For that reason alone I think the Government ought to give way in this matter.

                        <para>- Attention has been called to the fact that in dealing with trees, clause 126 as amended allows either the Postmaster-General or any offices to exercise authority. As a further safeguard, I am willing to agree, on behalf of the Postmaster-General, that the regulations which may be made in this matter shall provide that the officer shall not be an officer of any less rank than an inspector. By that means we get the safeguard of a high officer, and ample time is allowed to a municipality or public body, who consider their rights affected, to bring their case before the Postmaster-General. Heretofore, officers have dealt with trees at their pleasure, but now notice will have to be given, and a consultation is required. </para>
