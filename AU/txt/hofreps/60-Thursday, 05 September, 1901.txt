                        <para>- My honorable friend was good enough to intimate that he intended to ask this question. Section 89 of the Constitution Act provides for the 'collection of the money and for crediting and debiting it in a certain way, and then that the Commonwealth shall pay to each State, month by month, the balance, if any, in favour of the State. On the last day of each month each State has received the balance payable to it. Under the existing arrangement the staff of the Treasury, which is a very small one, remain till two or three in the morning of the 28th or the 29th of the month, as may be, in order that the whole of the calculations may be made. Telegrams are sent the next morning to our officers in each State that they are to remit to us a certain sum, being the share of the State in the new expenditure, and to pay over to the State the balance, whatever it may be. I can understand that, without there having been any delay or neglect whatever on the part of the Commonwealth, some little inconvenience may have arisen in the States through their not being able to collect their money day by day as in the post. No communication, however, has been mode to me in any shape or form, but, although the Constitution provides that the money shall be paid month by month, if it would be of any convenience to the States . for us to pay it at more frequent periods, I do not see any objection to our doing so. If, for example, it would be of any assistance to the States for us to pay week by week, we could arrange . to pay over what has . been collected, less what has been expended week by week, and at the end of the month the necessary adjustment could be made. If the Treasurer of New South Wales is anxious to have such an arrangement earned out I will consult with the Attorney-General. Honorable members may rest assured that we shall strain every nerve to enable the States to get the money at the earliest possible moment. </para>

I yield to no honorable member of this House in my desire to see that no alien race is absorbed in our community, and that work which can be efficiently performed by our own kith and kin is done by them, if it can be undertaken without detriment to their health or condition in life. This is the first of the various fences in connexion with this class of legislation which the House has had to take. I do not think that the manner in which the fence has been approached is as satisfactory as it might have been. </para>

                        <para>- I do not baulk as a rule ; I generally take my fences on the stride. Probably it is the intention of the committee to pass this clause upon the voices, but I do not propose that it shall so pass without having given some indication of my own view in regard to the principle involved. I believe that the attempt by the Attorney-General to overcome this difficulty by the insertion of a sub-clause in the clause relating to regulations was an attempt to get rid of considerable trouble. But personally, I prefer always that matters shall be dealt with in a straightforward way, and that there shall be no subterfuge adopted in the consideration of legislation of this character. I decline to believe that this is a question involving the greater question of a white Australia. I regard this Bill as a commercial measure entirely, and to hamper it with the restriction which is now submitted for our consideration is imposing upon those engaged in commercial transactions in an unnecessary obligation. I decline to think that we are studying the best interests of the Commonwealth by this hysterical effort to' carry out the idea of a white Australia, and to bring about restrictive legislation within the period covered by the first session which is necessarily fraught with much anxiety to the Ministry who have charge of the Bills which are essential to the harmonious working of the Commonwealth departments. My' object in rising is emphatically to enter my dissent from this" prostration before an ideal, however lofty it may be, and against the consideration of this clause on other than broad commercial lines. When the proper time arrives for the consideration t of the question of a white Australia, I shall not be behind any honorable ' member of this House in my desire to see ! that the people of Australia are not contaminated by fellowship with alien races. But I feel that the attempt which is now being made in this direction is .a mistake and a disadvantage to those who introduced it. I regret it very much. </para>

                        <para>- I ask you, sir, to look into the matter, and to give us your decision at a later stage. We have too much serious business to attend to in connexion with this Bill to delay its progress by challenging your ruling, or by placing you in a position which none of us desire to see you occupy. I shall content myself with saying that we do not know from one day to another what position the Government are taking up in regard to this matter. When they are backed by a large majority in sticking to their Bill, they refuse to insert a clause of this sort one day, and a little while after a member of the Government comes down and suggests getting over the difficulty presented by a side wind, and by adopting a course of procedure which I venture to think the majority of this committee would deprecate. The Attorney-General proposed to overcome the difficulty by a system of legislation -which I do not think it is a good thing in this higher Parliament of Australia to commence, namely by dealing with a matter in an underhanded, dodging, sinuous sort of manner. Those words perhaps are too mild to describe the ' position taken up by the Government upon this question. When it was found that there was a determination on the part of a certain section of this House and of a few other supporters of the Government to have this question decided promptly, and to have some such provision as is now before the committee inserted in the Bill, the attitude of the Ministry underwent a change, even though we were told by the Attorney-General only a few minutes before that it was inadvisable that such a provision should be inserted in the way proposed. The inference to be drawn from the remarks of the Attorney-General, carefully as they were couched, was that if such a provision were inserted the Bill would probably be refused the Royal assent. Within an hour after this endeavour on the part of the Attorney-General to "draw a herring across the trail," we had the Prime Minister telling us he had come to the conclusion that there was not the slightest fear of any veto - that this Bill was on an entirely different basis from the Immigration Bill, or from any experiences of Queensland, and that there was nothing to prevent the Bill being passed with this clause. </para>

                        <para>- Some of us are, and, like the Government, do just what the honorable member suggests. It seems strange to me that we should waste, in two branches of the Legislature, a considerable number of hours debating this question. The Government have had this matter under consideration, and have fought tooth and nail to win ; and yet, in a few minutes, we had the Prime Minister taking an attitude entirely different from that assumed by the Attorney-General on the same clause. . If that is a specimen of the way in which we are going to legislate on these questions, I am somewhat sorry for some of the supporters of the Government. Some of those who thought that the position taken up by the Government on this matter for over two months, and up to as late as four o'clock yesterday, was one that had received the consideration we naturally imagined such a question would receive at the hands cf the Cabinet, suddenly discovered that when threatened by a certain section of the committee, the Government climbed down very ungracefully. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure the speech of the honorable member for Maranoa, eloquent with the torrid heat of the district he represents, had great influence with the Prime Minister. My idea is that when the Government advocate a policy, they should advocate it fairly and squarely and take a test vote as quickly as possible. They ought not to dodge until they have carefully counted noses, and then frame the i policy of this great Commonwealth accord- I king to the peculiar altered circumstances in this House. I am inclined to compare the attitude taken by some members of the Government on this occasion to those assumed by the spineless lady who sometimes appears at the variety shows ; and I never expected to see the Prime Minister of this Commonwealth emulating such an example. The real point of the question was put very clearly by the honorable member for Wentworth. This is not a question of a "white Australia," and though it may suit some honorable members of the committee to raise that cry, it has very little indeed to do with the case. The question of a "white Australia" will have to be dealt with in a Bill which we hope will shortly be before us. As the honorable member for Wentworth pointed out a large majority of members have been returned pledged to support a "-white Australia." and I say with all due humility that there is no member of this House who has done more for that object during the past sixteen years than myself. I was the first who raised the cry against Chinese immigration, and endeavoured to conduct a crusade against the influx of these aliens at Port Darwin, and to induce the Government of South Australia . to put a stop to it some sixteen years ago ; so that I do not think that my advocacy of a " white Australia " which has been reiterated time after time in the State Parliament, for over ten years, can be questioned. As to the probability of the Imperial Government vetoing the Bill with the proposed clause in it, I do not think there is much danger, considering the form in which the proposal is now framed. When the clause came down to us at first it was proposed that none but British seamen should man any vessel which was under contract to carry Australian mails, and there was a very grave possibility of the Bill being vetoed by the Imperial Government. But the only danger we are running in stipulating that Indian subjects of His Majesty shall be debarred from employment in the stoke-holes of mail steamers, is that of jeopardizing the very handsome contribution which Great Britain at present contributes to our mail subsidy. In round figures I understand that the cost of the subsidized mail services at the present time is £177,000 per annum, of which Australia contributes about £70,000, and Great Britain the balance. Is it likely that Great Britain is going to negotiate these contracts, and submit to Australia placing a bar against her subjects in India working in the stoke-holes of the steamers? </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly I will; I am pledged to do so. I mention the fact of the increased expenditure in order to show how careful we should be that the whole cost of our mail services in two or three years time, when the contracts expire, is not thrown on the Commonwealth in consequence of Great Britain declining to continue her handsome contributions am not going to argue the question whether the steam-ship companies will take the contracts at the same rates as in the past. Possibly even with the stipulation as to the employment of white labour, the companies may be found willing to take the contracts at not much more than at present ; but on the other hand there is the point which I wish to emphasize, that I am very doubtful whether the British Government will be satisfied to negotiate these contracts and contribute at least one-third more than Australia towards the subsidy, while coloured British subjects in India are barred from employment on the steamers. We had a warning in connexion with the Natal Immigration Bill. It was pointed out that Great Britain would be placed in a very difficult position if colour were made a bar to the people of India coming to Australia. In Natal the educational test was adopted, and the Government of South Australia tried to follow the example. Of course, I do not know whether the education test now proposed by the Government may not be put aside and that of colour substituted ; judging from recent events, I should think such a contingency extremely probable. I want the committee to consider whether under the circumstances, with only two or three years to run before the contracts expire it is wise to hamper this purely machinery Bill with a clause of this kind. I do not think the fact that black stokers are not employed on the mail steamers will give one additional man a day's employment in Australia. In addition to the disabilities we have already placed on steam-ship companies in regard to ships' stores in the Customs Bill, the disabilities in another Bill to which I am not going to allude in detail, and also in the Inter-State Bill, are we going to impose another by saying they shall not enter into a contract for the carriage of Australian mails so long as they employ a black man in the stoke-hole? I am not going to argue the question whether white men can work in the stoke-holes in the Red Sea, but I know that in some six or eight trips round the coast of Australia, through the Torres Straits and on to Port Darwin, I have seen the stokehole work on the boats of the China Navigation Company, the Eastern Australian Company, the Netherlands-India Company, and other vessels, as much as the black stokers could stand, and it was sometimes pitiable to see the condition in which they were brought up on deck. In hot climates I have no hesitation in saying the work is absolutely unfitted for white men, and that it is more trying than is the work in the sugar-fields. It is for the committee to consider whether we are not opening the door to too much additional expense in taking up the attitude now suggested. I desire as much as any one to establish a white Australia, but I wish to see it done in such a way as not to unnecessarily hamper our trade relations. I think that a white Australia should be brought about, and I am pledged to assist in bringing it about, but I think that it would have been better to leave the question out of this Bill altogether, and to deal with it by legislation relating purely to the question of the introduction of black people into Australia. We have no right to smuggle the question into this Bill, and I can see no excuse at all for adopting the course which is now advocated by the honorable member for West Sydney. The desire of the labour party is apparently to bind the Government - whom they are at present supporting - to a definite line of policy on this question. </para>

                        <para>- Judging from what we have seen I am very much in sympathy with the idea that such a course is necessary. I hope that the proposed new clause will not be passed, but that the committee will see that as a matter of purely financial consideration it would be very much wiser to deal with all questions relating to the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers, and the introduction of coloured immigrants into Australia, in a separate Bill covering the whole ground fully and fairly. </para>

                    <para>- I have been rather surprised to hear the utterances of the honorable member who has just sat down, and, as one of the supporters of the Government, I must thank him for the very favorable opinion he entertains of us, as if we were some stream that would follow in whatever channel the Government might choose to cut. As far as I can gather, the Government lay down a very clear course. The Attorney-General clearly put it before the House that he could see that a difficulty would probably arise with the British Government if we included in the Bill the principle contained in the proposal of the honorable member for West Sydney, and he proposed that the matter should be dealt with by a provision merely stating that any proposed mail contracts should be brought before the House, and submitted for discussion, before they were accepted by the Government. This would enable honorable members to express their approval or 'otherwise of any proposed agreement 'before any subsidies were paid. A number of questions ocCur lr connexion with this matter which require the serious consideration of the House. We have to consider what we shall have to pay for a white Australia, and we can1 only arrive at a :just conclusion upon this point, when we know what steamers it is proposed to employ, what kind of labour is to'be employed, and what subsidy will be required under different conditions. We shall have to go further than this even. We shall have to take into account considerations of trade and commerce not only on our own shores, but with foreign countries; and the time is- not very far distant when we shall have to consider what sort of labour shall be. encouraged and paid for on those steamers which carry on our trade beyond the Commonwealth. So far as my own personal feeling goes I would employ not only white people but British subjects as far as it is possible. I believe that white men are quite capable of doing the work in the stoke-holes of these steamers, and I would have gone further than the honorable member for West Sydney has gone, by providing that all men employed in connexion with these steamers, whether for coaling or other purposes, should be white men and British subjects. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not go so far as that. I think the Government have been treated rather harshly by members on the opposition side. The Government and those supporting them are doing something which the members of the Opposition do not want them to do, but which honorable members on the other side would, at the same time, like the country to -believe that they are in favour of. The Government are taking the proper course in this matter, and the discussion which has taken place will be of the utmost value, because it will show that the feeling of the House is strongly in favour of having this question of the employment of coloured labour on mail steamers fought out at once on high principles. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the clause has been improved by the Attorney-General, but I would point out that he has omitted to take notice of a necessary amendment which was first suggested by the honorable member for Moreton. If a person wishes to register a new newspaper he is confronted with the difficulty presented by the words of the clause - " a publication known and recognised as a newspaper." Seeing that his newspaper does not exist, it cannot be " known and recognised," nor can it placed upon the registered list until it has actually been issued. I think the Attorney-General might make the first line of the clause read - </para>

                        <para>- I think it would come a little cheaper to the reader, and we are here to do what we can for the Post-office. Free-trader as I am, I would give employment to the people of Australia in any way that I possibly could rather than provide work for those outside, but I do not want to go out of my way to drive away trade. When we come to consider the number of these papers that are wrapped up and, addressed and posted in England, and the amount of labour that is involved, we can see that the question is one of greater importance than at first appears, and that we should have that work done here if possible. I desire to be fair in this matter, and I acknowledge that the Government have treated us very fairly, but I am very anxious to have these magazines, and newspapers carried through our own Post-offices instead of through other Post-offices. If a newspaper is posted in London for Tibooburra we have to carry the paper from the seaboard inland for nothing, whereas if the paper were posted within the Commonwealth we should get the benefit of the postage rate for newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- The income-tax is all right, because that is a direct contribution towards the expenses of the government, and does not goto the enrichment of private monopolists. I hope the honorable member for the Barrier will recognise that the omission of the words he has proposed to strike out would lay the Post-office open to great abuse. The. benefits that would be derived in such cases as those mentioned by the honorable member would be infinitesimal, and not worth considering as against the disadvantages which would attach to the omission of the words. </para>

                    <para>-I desire to enter a protest against the suggestion of the honorable member for South Sydney that we should look upon the Post-office as a commercial concern. The Post-office affords one of the most valuable means of opening up vast areas of this continent, and if we were to consider it from a purely commercial stand-point we should prevent the development of vast tracts of territory, which it would be impossible to settle at all without offering facilities such as those now enjoyed through the Post-office. It is because of the facilities which the Post-office offers for disseminating useful and interesting publications for the benefit of the people in the outlying districts that we have to define the publications which shall be carried at a low rate of payment. I protest, therefore, against the commercial aspect being imported into the consideration of matters connected with the Post-office. </para>

                    <para>- It is all very well for honorable members on the other side to express the hope that the discussion on this clause shall not be prolonged from the fiscal stand-point, while they at the same time talk about protectionists being dodgers and monopolists. However, as the sting of a reproach lies in its truth, and as there is no truth in the reproaches directed at us in this matter, we can very well afford to pass them by. </para>

                        <para>- I was about to point out that the provision may press hardly upon the proprietors of weekly newspapers who enclose supplements as a regular thing in each issue of their journals. Sometimes supplements to be issued by various newspapers over a period of four or five weeks are printed at one time, and if it were necessary to put the date at the top of each page it would involve unnecessary handling of the "formes." </para>

There may be a conflict between the decisions of judges in the different States on some matter, and we must have the right given to the Commonwealth to go, sooner or later, whether by original jurisdiction or appeal, into the High Court. I do not disagree with the suggestion that we should have the power to go to a State Judge, but I think that this ought to be accompanied by the right to go to the Federal High. Court if the Commonwealth or the other party is not satisfied with the finding of the State Judge. </para>

I know that the electrical authority - having been in conversation with him and the Postmaster-General on two or three occasions - strongly urges the position that the complete control of all. systems of telegraphy, and indeed of everything connected with the use of electricity, shall be under the supervision of the Post and Telegraph department. I understand the honorable member for Melbourne to say that there is in existence at the present time a tramway which is the property of a private company. On the, poles of that private company there are wires stretched for the use only of that company. In country districts similar provision might be made to that set out in paragraphs («) and (6) with respect to telegraphs and telephones, which are used on private estates. In the city,' however, the electricians urge that all the. restrictions contained in this Bill should absolutely apply. , </para>

                        <para>- Only such reasons, as are given in the Electric Light and Power Act of London, which imposes all these restrictions with respect to' private lines, and places them under some regulations which the chairman of the Board of Trade controls. As we have no Board of Trade here the Postmaster-General wishes to step in, and acting under the advice of his electrical authority, to lay down regulations and1 establish practice with regard to the user of these particular lines, especially when they are within cities. It seems to me that where there are lines which may interfere with public lines there should be some special power in the hands of the Postmaster-General to exercise control over them. I must leave the matter in the hands of the committee, and if the honorable member should be successful in his endeavour to insert these words, it must remain for the electrical authority to show cause why they should not be retained. </para>

                        <para>- But I would point out that there sire tramway companies in the Commonwealth other than electric companies. Whilst I am prepared to allow any private railway company in country districts to have telephone or telegraph lines to facilitate the transaction of their own business I do not think we should go any further. In a Queensland Act there is a section which actually allows a private company to receive and transmit messages for the public. That is a matter which I hope the committee will never tolerate here. The main object of these private companies is to run railways and not to conduct telephonic or telegraphic communication. I ask the Government to carefully consider the matter before giving way. </para>

                <para>SirMALCOLM McEACHARN (Melbourne). In reply to the honorable member for Bland, I may say that it is almost essential, in the case of tramways, that there should be telephonic communication. It may be a matter of life or death at times. If an accident happens at a distance from the head -station, the drivers of the car have instruments with them which they can connect with the telephone wire, and they are thus able to ask for the electric current to be cut off, whereas if a messenger had to be sent back, it might be a quarter of an hour before the disconnection could be made, and in that time death might be caused to some person who might come into contact with the heavily-charged traction wire. Not long ago there was a death in Melbourne through some one coming into contact with a wire which had fallen. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Government should give the matter serious consideration. This Parliament must respect the rights which have been given to private companies, such as the private railway companies in Queensland, though I maintain that those rights should never have been given, and I fought against the passing of the measures by which they were given. It is probable, however, that similar measures will be introduced into the Queensland Parliament this session, and I wish to know, therefore, if the Queensland Legislature will have power to grant concessions in regard to telephone and telegraph communications to future companies. </para>

                        <para>- No. That company would have had control of one-sixth of the telegraph lines of Queensland. We should watch these matters very closely, and provide definitely that the Postmaster-General may resume telegraph and telephone lines after due notice has been given. If a mining field becomes a large centre' of population, big profits may be made out of these private lines, upon which, in some cases, the companies are allowed' to charge 50 per cent. more than the Government rates. </para>

                    <para>- I am a believer in the Commonwealth retaining the control of great undertakings, such as those to which the clause applies, but if private enterprise is to be hampered by unnecessary restrictions, I am afraid that the development which there is the strongest justification for expecting in the northern parts of Queensland will be interfered with. I agree with the honorable member for Melbourne that the committee should exercise caution and see that restrictions are not placed in the Bill which will interfere with the expansion of private enterprise. Where the Commonwealth will not undertake the responsibility of providing and maintaining telegraphic or telephonic communication, unnecessary restrictions should not be imposed to prevent private enterprise from doing the work. </para>

The Post-office officials say that the danger bes in boughs of trees which project over without actually touching the telegraph lines, and which when saturated with moisture, affect the lines to such an extent as to greatly impede their working. All the officials require is that these particular branches should be lopped off. </para>

                    <para>- While I agree that there are circumstances in which money can be no compensation, still, where the public are willing . to offer compensation, there should be power to take possession of anything in the public interest. If a railway is projected, and a house and a tree stand in the way, that house and tree have to go. If the honorable member had a tramway proposal and a house stood in the road, the house would have to be removed. </para>

I agree with the honorable and learned member for South Australia, and also with the honorable and learned member for Indi, who raised a similar point previously, that it is highly desirable that the regulations in all our Acts should, as far as possible, be dealt with by the same procedure, have the same authority, and be enforced in the same manner. As it is, under the State Acts, when reference is made to a regulation under an Act, one is obliged in each case to look up the Act in order to ascertain the force given to the regulation, or the manner in which it can be challenged. It is desirable that there should be uniformity in all these matters, and my attention has been directed towards it, although I do not know that I can promise to make a beginning with this particular clause. </para>

As the clause stands we obtain finality as to the determination of what are " reasonable precautions " by the decision of the arbitrator. The arbitrator would have no power to define " reasonable precautions " as referred to in the amendment ; he can deal with " reasonable precautions " only as they are to be ascertained from the provisions of clause 138. </para>

We must therefore put into this Bill all the provisions that are necessary to protect him. </para>

                    <para>- I read the amendment the other way. Clause 138 provides that certain proceedings must be taken before a line may be constructed. But no matter what may be done with the consent of the Postmaster-General under clause 138, if his lines are not necessarily injuriously, but in any way affected, within the meaning of clause 137, the electric authority will be responsible. The honorable member for Dalley wishes to make an exception in favour of tramway companies which have complied with certain requirements. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the honorable member who has proposed this sub-clause will not press it. It deals with an important proposition, the object of which I entirely sympathize with. But I doubt if it would be possible to compress within the limits of the sub-clause, or even a clause, all the powers and provisions that will be necessary to give effect to the honorable member's purpose. It aims at the very desirable end of, at all events, assisting, with the consent of the Executive of the Commonwealth, each State to carry out its own legislation within itself to a further degree than would otherwise be possible. It need not see its own intentions under its own acts defeated by the overriding power possessed by the Federal Post-office to carry into the State articles which the State laws prohibit. As the honorable member has drawn up this clause, however, he casts upon the Postmaster-General the duty of determining what is, within the intention and meaning of any Act of the State, an indecent or obscene book or picture. That is a serious obligation which I think cannot be too lightly undertaken, and the subject is too large to be dealt with in a sub-clause as now proposed. </para>

Parliament can legislate in the direction in which the States have already legislated to protect themselves.' If we cannot, then by handing over the control of the post-offices to the Commonwealth the States will have deprived themselves of one of those elements of administration that are necessary for the enforcement of local laws. If the States are not to have continued to them the advantages they have hitherto possessed, because they have handed over 'certain powers to the Commonwealth, they ought to know their position at once. I hope the committee will consider the matter, and that if there is any way of meeting the objections raised we shall have them removed. I cannot consent to withdraw the amendment, as I desire that the committee should take the responsibility of dealing with it. </para>

In some of the States certain enactments have been passed providing that newspapers containing particular kinds of advertisements shall be destroyed by the Postmaster-General ; and, so far as' South Australia is concerned, the Acts there relating to this matter would be rendered inoperative, unless protected, as proposed here.

                        <para>- However that may be, I shall take every opportunity of upholding the laws of South Australia, which are directed' to the suppression of a certain class of advertisements. These advertisements will be suppressed in South Australia until this Bill is passed. But when this measure has passed there will be no legislation in force for their suppression. The words have a special meaning in the South Australian statute. I intend, therefore, to support the honorable member, though I believe that he ought to make it clear that the amendment applies only to Acts at present in force. More machinery than appears here requires to be inserted for the carrying out of the provision. </para>

                    <para>- I shall vote against the proposal, because it seems to me that by its adoption we should be creating a most extraordinary position. We should have the Postmaster-General attempting to administer the Acts of the different States, although those Acts might vary to a very considerable extent. It would be utterly absurd to ask the Postmaster-General to attempt in the slightest degree to administer State laws. Moreover, the States have full power to protect themselves in regard to all publications issued within their own territory. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to ask if there is anything in the Constitution that enables my honorable friend to move this amendment with a view to giving the States the power proposed. It seems to me that the amendment is an invasion of the Commonwealth powers and of the Postmaster-General's rights. Under its operation each State could set up and run the Commonwealth under a sort of split division. Tasmania would exercise one power, Western Australia another, and so by-and-by we should have a lot of Postmasters-General. There is thus no telling where the matter will end. For that reason I must vote against the honorable member. </para>

The choice which the honorable member for Kennedy places before us is not between resumption and non-resumption, but between resumption as an executive act, of which Parliament may not be fully informed, and resumption as an act of the Commonwealth Legislature. As a representative of the people, I am very loath to part with the control of Parliament in these matters. If the resumption is an executive act, Parliament will have the choice, not between approval or disapproval of it, but between approval of it and the dismissal of the Ministry for making it, so that, instead of being able to deal directly with the question, we shall be able to deal with it only indirectly. A 50 years' concession of rights such as the honorable member for Kennedy referred to is not a thing which I should have supported if I had been in the House in which it was proposed, but I think that Parliament should have all proposals for resumption definitely before it, and should not allow resumptions to be made without its sanction even by so trusted an Executive as that now in office. </para>

                    <para>- For the purpose of private profit, though, no doubt, the public interest is subserved, or otherwise the power would not be given. The honorable and learned member for Corinella objects to the power of resumption being given to the Executive instead of to Parliament," but if each resumption had to be authorized by special Act, it would be an exceptional and invidious procedure. What we want is a general rule. We are providing now for the regulation of the post and telegraph services of the Commonwealth. Certain companies and individuals - especially in Queensland, where they have done some queer things- have been given special concessions. I understand that in some cases private companies have obtained concessions in- regard to telegraphic and telephonic communication which extend over 50 years. It is not going too far, however, to say that the Postmaster-General may take over those lines on payment of reasonable compensation, if he thinks it necessary to do so in the public interest. It is our duty to recognise contracts within reasonable limits, even if they have been wrongly made, but it is not necessary for us to be pedantic in the matter, when there are precedents for compulsory resumption which go back for years. I think that the principle of the amendment should be embodied in the Bill, though I admit that it requires to be moulded into proper shape. That can best be done by the Minister in charge of the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- We must recognise rights and concessions which have already been granted, but where it is thought advisable to acquire private property for public purposes, it is the duty of the State to do so, paying at the same time a fair equivalent for it to the persons from whom it is taken. I do not think, however, that we are at present in a position to say what are the terms upon which this should be done under the Bill. The Commonwealth cannot resume a private telegraph or telephone line which never belonged to it. This is not a mere technical difficulty, it is a practical difficulty. One can understand the Postmaster-General saying to a private company - "You shall no longer have the control of your lines. I intend to take them over,' and to pay you compensation for them "; but if he takes over a line he must take land, or right of access, with it. </para>

                        <para>- He must take an easement. We must be ' more definite than the wording of the clause as drafted, and no final bargain should be made merely by executive act. It has been found in Victoria, and I have no doubt in other parts of Australia also, that when the construction of a railway is contemplated the value of the land through which it will pass is enormously increased. Therefore, I think it would be well, if we give power to the Postmaster-General to give notice of intention to take over a line, to provide that the compensation shall be based upon the value at the date of the giving of that notice, and that it shall be finally agreed upon before the matter is placed before Parliament; and that the Postmaster-General should not be allowed to commit the Commonwealth without the sanction of Parliament. The desire of the honorable member for Kennedy is a right one, but his amendment will require very careful drafting for the protection of the interests, not only of private companies, but also of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I indorse the view that, where the interests of a private company or. a private individual may be found to clash with those of the general public, they must give way, but, at the same time, we should see that the private company or 'private individual whose property is taken for public, purposes obtains fair compensation for it. No new principle is involved in the amendment. Every time that the State resumes land for a railway or any other public purpose it violates an existing contract, but it does so in the interests of the public, and the individual suffers no loss, because he receives fair compensation. It appears to. me that if we fail to insert any such provision as this in the Bill, rights may hereafter accrue. Concessions which have been received may become more valuable, and, therefore, this amendment or the principle involved in the amendment, is a proper one. . At the same time, I quite agree with the honorable and learned member for Indi, that the Government, before adopting the amendment should look carefully into it, and so frame it as to meet all the exigencies of the case : and if that be done the committee may very well affirm the principle. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know what is the attitude of the Government so far, but I would suggest that if they have not yet been able to draft an amendment to surmount the difficulties suggested, and which I quite appreciate, it may be possible to meet the case by adopting the suggested clause in its present shape, with a view to subsequent alteration. It will not be possible to insert a new clause in another place, but a clause sent from here could be amended. </para>

                        <para>- It relates to land and property : and the measure is drawn in the most general terms. From my recollection of the Bill as it entered the Chamber, I believe it provides amply for carrying out the intention of this clause. I am aware that it has been amended in some respects, but I have not undertaken to follow the discussions elsewhere. I cannot say whether its efficiency in this direction has been impaired by amendments, but I think not in any respect. If the principle of this clause, which is a familiar principle, is again indorsed in relation to telegraph and telephone lines, as the honorable member for Kennedy desires; and if, when we again examine the Bill, which is about to be sent down to us, it is found not to cover the case, we can consider whether such a provision may not be more properly introduced there than here. If it be not provided for there, it may be as well to leave it in this Bill. It is unnecessary to have a double discussion of the same principle. If the committee, as I understand they do, accept the principle, I will examine the Bill, and consider the best procedure. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member. In the case of a railway considerable risk has to be taken, and a railway may be worked for years without any profit. It would not be just for the Government .to have the option of coining in at any time, and taking the works over for one-tenth more than they cost. Under the Queensland Act the Postal department had the right to buy, after 50 years, under certain conditions, the purchase money to be not more, under any circumstances, than one and one-tenth of the actual cost of construction. The same principle will apply to the case of telegraphs. </para>

That was not a very sound objection as it appeared to me, but, in any case, it does not apply to the new clause. The sole object I have in view is to protect the cable communication, and to do that in a way to which I am sure no one, who is not inclined to be prejudiced against a certain company, can take the slightest objection. The suggestion that the proposal is in favour of any particular company is quite ridiculous, the only object being to protect international cable communication. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the present law, and it certainly would not be the law under this Bill as introduced. In the case of an electrical authority being there before the cable company are connected with the Post-office, the cable company would have to protect themselves against induction. That is a different proposal from the amendment submitted last night. It is only fair that a cable, on which we depend so much for getting our messages with as little delay as possible, should be protected where another electrical authority may come in and ruin the cable connexion for a considerable period, unless the metallic return be adopted. </para>

                        <para>- I also was compelled to oppose the amendment submitted last night, because it appeared to place a private company in a position of apparent superiority to a State-owned system. Neither a State, nor municipality in a State, which desired to establish electric trams or electric lighting in the neighbourhood of the junction between the cable and the Postmaster-General's office, should be placed in a position of inferiority to a private investment. But I am now compelled to re-echo the remarks of the honorable member, for Melbourne. The proposed new clause is of a very different character from the amendment of last night, and maybe regarded without apprehension. The connecting line can only be a short line, and no right is conferred on a private company which is not conferred throughout the Bill upon the Postmaster-General in all cases in which his lines are affected by any more recently constructed work. As I had occasion, in discussing the general question, to point out last evening, this being a telegraph line, it cannot possibly injuriously affect any other line, seeing that it is constructed on the low-current system. But if by any possibility there should be on the shores of South Australia, where this cable will land, any electric trams or system of electric lighting, the utmost burden imposed on the new venture is to either pay the small cost of moving the telegraph line - which might be the cheaper course - or adopting the metallic circuit, or some other device to meet the case. We have consistently throughout the measure provided that the last comer in matters electrical is to be responsible for putting the previously established system to any extra expense. That is not unreasonable, and is all that is proposed. The new clause gives neither the Eastern Extension Company nor the Pacific Cable Company any new rights or privileges, but simply puts this position - that a new company may be put to the expense of rendering their system impervious against leakage or induction from the more powerful systems used for tramways or electric lighting. Under the circumstances, I think the proposal is not an unreasonable one. </para>

The lines contemplated in the amendment form the connecting links between us and the outside world, and the private considerations involved are as nothing compared with those which affect the whole community. The mere incident that these lines belong to private companies should not deter us from protecting them as essential links in our lines of communication with the world beyond the seas. </para>

                        <para>- We know that the lines of the Eastern Extension Company are contemplated. I have no objection to that company, but I have just the same regard for any potential company which may come into existence for the .purpose of carrying out any tramway or electric lighting scheme, and for the State tramways and the municipal electric lighting schemes. Each and every one of these authorities have to take their chance under present, circumstances, and if they clash with one another under the law of the State in which they are operating, why should we single out any one for specially considerate treatment? Hie main objections which were urged against the amendment in its original form have not been removed, and I shall certainty oppose it in its present shape. </para>

                    <para>- The position that was taken up last evening that we cannot give such special protection to any one company as we decline to give to the States, appears to me to be incontestable. No one can set bounds to the purposes to which electricity will be applied, and the Commonwealth Government would do a very great wrong if it created any vested rights in favour of any one company. We do not know how far the interests of the various States might be prejudiced by such a provision as that now suggested, and I hope the committee will not waste any further time over this matter, but decide to reject the amendment once and for all. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is only just that I should call the attention of the committee to the fact that this is not as some honorable members have put it, an instance of giving to a private company certain rights that we are refusing to the States. None of the States can own telegraph or telephone lines, and no private corporation can be affected except the Eastern Extension Company, the Pacific Cable Company - if that can be considered a private corporation - or any other cable company that may construct a cable and land it on our shores. It is only in these instances that we can have connexions made between cable ends and the lines of the Postmaster-General. It cannot be said that we are granting to a private company what we are refusing to a State, because these cable companies furnish exceptional instances of which there can never be more than two or three in Australia. The question as. to State rights cannot very well arise. These connexions must be very few and very short. Although the States cannot construct telegraph or telephone lines, they can authorize the carrying out of certain forms of electrical enterprise, but as. has often been pointed out, these enterprises must always take the form of using electricity at a higher power than it is used in connexion with telegraph or telephone lines. These enterprises cannot suffer from the telegraph or telephone lines, but the high power works may have an absolutely disastrous effect upon a telegraph line or cable. The telegraph lines require protection, because nearly every other form of high electrical power can damage them without damaging itself. The honorable member for South Australia has put his case very clearly, and without over-stating it in the least, lt appears to me that the language of the clause is capable of improvement, and if it be approved by the committee it will be necessary to revise it. It might be rendered perfectly innocuous, if the mover sees no objection to that course, by coupling with it a general power of control by the Postmaster-General. That is to say the Postmaster-General shall approve the length of the line to be deemed a connexion, and shall be the arbitrator in the event of any electrical authority coming into such close proximity with that line as to cause injury. </para>

That would retain the paramountcy of the Post-office, and render the clause perfectly innocuous. </para>

                        <para>- But supposing that a person is injured by the legitimate act of another part}' why should the other party pay? If I have a shop upon one side of the street for the purpose of selling groceries and a man establishes himself on the opposite side, and also sells groceries, thereby injuring me, I have not the least right to compensation. 'It is for the State law to deal between the Eastern Extension Company - where its cable touches its shores - and other companies. Let us suppose that a State law enacts that it is perfectly lawful for a traction company to lay down its lines in a certain place. If by laying those lines in that place the Eastern Extension Company's lines are interfered with, thereby involving that company in a little expense, that is a matter between the traction company and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. Surely it is not for the Federal Parliament to interfere and to give the same lights to the Eastern Extension Company as it gives to its Postmaster-General. Although I think it is more a matter of principle than of practical importance, I shall have to vote against the proposal. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne seems to have altogether missed the point at issue. The question, as I understand it, is that the Eastern Extension Company's cable ought not be regarded as a private concern at all. The public has a very great interest in it. Next to the Postmaster-General's own lines, if there is anything that we should protect it is the shore end of that cable system. In the proposal before the committee we are trying to prevent a private company from doing injury to a line in' which the public are very greatly concerned at the present time. We merely ask that if a company does injure that line they shall be bound to pay compensation to the extent of the injury. The honorable member for Kooyong put the position very clearly. I shall support the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I look at this matter from a Commonwealth stand-point. It is merely an accident that this cable lands in South Australia instead of one of the more populous States of New South Wales or Victoria. We all benefit by the cable running from South Australia, and it is not a very big concession which is asked for. South Australia merely asks the Commonwealth to protect a little piece of land line from being spoiled by a company which is likely to start there with electric traction. They do not ask for any special legislation on the matter, but merely for a little protection. By all means let us extend to South Australia a little Victorian protection on this particular occasion. I hope that the clause will be carried. </para>

                    <para>- That does not leave us very much to complain of, I admit, but there is still the question between the Postmaster-General and the electrical authority concerned. Is it fair that the Postmaster-General should be made the arbitrator in a matter of this sort? We are not merely dealing with the South Australian end of the Eastern Extension Company's cable, but with other cable ends also. For example, there is a cable end which comes into Queensland from New Caledonia. I have a decided objection to giving special privileges to a company like that, which is entirely a foreign company, and which has overreached various Governments to an extent to which it ought never to have been allowed to do. In New South Wales we have to pay this foreign company £2,000 a year for 30 years for a line over which we have not the slightest control, and which produces practically no revenue at all. </para>

Both these cable companies will still have their tights, and if any other company injures them, they will be able to protect themselves. The Eastern Extension Cable Company is sufficiently rich to be able to look after itself, if we continue to give it the opportunity of so doing. But if we buttress it up by giving it special concessions, it will continue to ask for them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not dispute that they did deserve it, but the question is whether we should give them these further concessions for which they are asking. I, for one, think we should not, and I hope the committee will vote as it did last night, and let this company stand upon its merits for once in its existence, without being buttressed up by these special considerations. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with what has been said against this clause, and the reason I am going to support it is this : We have, I think illogically and wrongly, given to the Government certain rights. We have put the Postmaster-General in a preferential position, and, since we have done that, it is only right, if we want to be consistent, that we should allow something like the same protection to the portion of the line that connects the Government' system with the cable. We can only regard the cable as a matter of convenience and utility. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what further extension the honorable member refers to. I am looking at this cable as a convenience to the Postmaster - General, because it connects his system with the outside world. We have given the Postmaster-General certain rights, and to be consistent we should grant the same rights to the Eastern Extension Company. If the question was whether the Postmaster-General should have these rights, my vote would bo against it, and then if this proposal were made I would vote against it also. </para>

                    <para>- I would like to ask the Attorney-General if he would consider the matter which was raised on the clause in regard to the Indecent Advertisements Acts. Although there was a very strong chorus of disapproval negativing the proposal which was made, I understand it was not so much directed against the principle as the manner in which it was attempted to be carried out. I suggest to the Attorney - General that he might be able to insert a definition in this Bill which would cover the definitions in the Acts of Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and other States which have adopted this legislation. A portion of the provisions of those Acts will be inoperative, unless the Post-office can be used as it has been used for the purpose of preventing indecent publications coming into the States from abroad. If the Attorney-General accepts the suggestion, he can introduce into the Bill a provision which will cover the definitions already in the State Acts, such as that "indecent" shall mean what is understood by the common law of England, or what it is interpreted to mean by any such Act. I hope the Attorney-General will seriously weigh the matter, which is one of considerable importance. </para>
