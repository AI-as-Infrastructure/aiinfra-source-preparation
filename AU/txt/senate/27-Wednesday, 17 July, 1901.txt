                    <para>- The amendments, as they have been reprinted, make confusion worse confounded. This morning I received a copy of the amendments covering a volume of paper, and arranged very differently from what I have been used to. It would be a wiser and more convenient plan to print the amendments of each senator on a separate sheet. As it is, I have to hunt all over this paper to find my amendments. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment of which I gave notice was for the insertion of a sub-clause, providing that a telegram should be transmitted by the route prescribed by the sender, at the tariff for that route. This is in accordance with the agreement of the International Telegraph Convention at Berne. At present there is what is called Reuter's telegraph line, which would be more or less under the command of the post-office. There is also the route by way of the Cape and before very long there will be a route by the Pacific, and probably also a route north from the Cape or what is known as the Cape-Cairo line. The principle was laid down by the Berne Convention in regulation number 2 that the sender of a telegram should have the right of deciding by what route his message should be sent. The object of my amendment is to carry out that rule. I need hardly say that the immediate effect of it would be that those who preferred to send their messages by Reuter's line could do so. On the other hand, those who preferred to send their messages by the line of the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company could do so. Unless this concession be given in the Bill it will entirely destroy the position taken up by New South Wales and South Australia under which - rightly, I think - they have taken advantage of that company's line, and, as a matter of fact, a very large number of merchants invariably send by that line in preference to the others as being equally rapid and more economical.

                        <para>- I do not think this amendment will be of any benefit, and it might under certain circumstances be very mischievous. I do not see how it can effect any good purpose so long as there are different rates for cable messages, because if the sender pays the lower rate his message will be sent by that particular service, whereas if he pays the higher rate it will go by the service for which the higher rate is charged. I cannot see that there is any advantage in giving the sender the right to indicate the route if rates are dissimilar. </para>

                        <para>- Where it will become positively mischievous will be in cases where we have two or more cable services and the published rates are equal. The disadvantage will be that a provision of that kind will enable persons to make private arrangements with the cable company to have their messages sent at a discount, and that I think will operate very prejudicially against the cable that is owned by the State. Of course what the honorable senator is looking forward to is the completion of the Pacific cable. </para>

                    (New South Wales).Whatever doubt I may have had at first with regard to this matter has entirely disappeared after hearing the remarks of the Postmaster-General. He has furnished excellent reasons for adopting the amendment proposed by
                    Sargood. The Postmaster-General states that the postal authorities should have the absolute' right of determining by which route messages intrusted to them should be forwarded, and he furnished some reasons why his department should be placed in that position. But surely the honorable and learned senator has not overlooked the fact that that will place in the hands of the Postmaster-General an absolute power to shut up a private cable.

                    <para>- If it were really intended to do that, one could understand the insertion of a clause for the suppression of private enterprise entirely. But let it be an open clause, so that we may know what we are doing. Under the Bill as it stands, the Postmaster-General will be able to determine that, the rates being the same, all messages shall go by the State-owned cable. I am not sure that if the rates were different he could not insist that the messages should go by the State-owned cable. </para>

                        <para>- It should be remembered that a State-owned cable is not in the same position as a privately-owned cable for the reason that the State-owned enterprise is conducted in the light of day. It has to publish its rates and it cannot allow any discount. One man has to pay the same rate as another. But a privately owned cable can make secret agreements with certain - persons to take messages at reduced rates. If a proposal of this kind is allowed to go in the Bill it will mean that the private cable company will be able to make such arrangements with the public as will enable it to obtain all the cream of the business, and the State owned cable will have to carry such messages as come to it at its published rates. </para>

                    (Tasmania). I intend to support
                    Sargood in his amendment. If the arguments he has used are not sufficient and satisfactory;, any supplement to them that is necessary has been furnished by the Postmaster-General himself. It seems to me that the statement the Postmaster-General has made supplies an excellent' reason for supporting the amendment. It might occasionally occur to us that incidentally we are legislating for the convenience of the public. The Postmaster-General has practically suggested that we are legislating against the convenience of the public.

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will restrain his impetuosity for a minute or two we may arrive at some conclusion. The Postmaster-General's objection to the amendment simply is that he wants to maintain the Government monopoly in connexion with cable communication as well as in regard to postal matters, and he wishes to leave it to the Government itself to make arrangements with the private companies. Here we have a private cable company with which the State Governments formerly, and now the Government of the Commonwealth enters into an arrangement to give a subsidy of from £50,000 to £200,000or £300,000 per annum. </para>

                        <para>- It certainly presents itself to me in that light. It may be a selfish light in which to view the matter, but I think we are quite justified in looking at it in that way. I fail to see the great danger of the monopoly that has been referred to, seeing that it is going to be a Government monopoly - if it is to be a monopoly at all. In view of that fact, I do not think we should have such regard for the vested interests of the syndicate cable lines. We should rather have greater regard for the rights of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Decidedly. If there were two competing lines, and they were owned by different States, no doubt each State would like the message to go over its line. Surely, however, the Post-office should decide. In arriving at a decision, it would consider the public convenience, and it would send the message over the route that was least blocked. The question of allotment of revenue does not arise in connexion with this matter. In a great many cases we can send messages to one particular town over three different routes.We simply keep the three lines as busy as we can, and send the message by the route most convenient. If this amendment were intended to apply to land lines the absurdity of it would be seen at once. If a man wishes to send a telegram to Ballarat he does not prescribe the route by which it shall go. A message to that city can be sent through two routes, and the Postal department send the wire over the line that is least busily employed. </para>

                    (South Australia). - The Postmaster-General must know that the South Australian State-owned line connects at Port Darwin with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company's cable. Therefore, in referring to the land lines, we are practically speaking of the ocean lines as well. I see that
                    is prepared to speak on this subject, and as I know he is thoroughly conversant with it, I will give place to him.

                        <para>- They came to us-' and told us what they would do. They asked a certain subsidy as an inducement for laying the line, and the States willingly agreed to their proposals. The subsidy has since been increased or decreased according to circumstances. When they have lowered the rates they have asked the States to increase the subsidy in order to make up the difference and free them from loss. The whole thing has been purely a business transaction between the States and the company, and the company has kept to its engagements honestly. The company having come in at a time when we were not prepared to bear the expense of joining Australia to Europe by cable, I do not know that it is fair on our part now to say that we will not encourage them in the future, and to say we will do all that we can to prevent them from having trade with this country. They are entitled to a ' fair amount of consideration. If this amendment is not carried, and if the Postmaster-General chooses to exercise his powers in the direction I have indicated, he will inflict considerable hardship upon the State that least deserves it. As in postal matters we allow' a man to say by what route his letters are to be carried, by parity of reasoning we should also allow a man who wants to send a telegram to say by what route his telegram shall be sent. </para>

                    he will not resent my saying a few words for myself. A great deal lias been said about monopoly, but I take it that what the Postmaster-General desires to do is to establish, at any rate, the right to create a monopoly. On the other hand, we do not ask for any ' monopoly for private individuals, but we say that where they establish a cable service it should be placed on exactly the same level as the State -owned cable, and senders of messages should be allowed to take their choice between the two. In speaking of a monopoly, some senators appear to have overlooked the fact that there is the widest possible difference between land lines in a territory absolutely owned and controlled by the federal authorities; and a cable which runs through territory beyond' their control. The Postmaster-General mentioned the case of three telegraph lines from one town, and said it would be absurd to allow the sender of a message to such a place to indicate which line lie preferred to have it sent by, but the honorable and learned senator forgets that in that case the State rates would be the same for one line as for the other, and that there would be no objection to picking a particular line. There would be a very big difference, indeed, if there were varying charges for the different lines.

                        <para>- We have heard a lot of these remarks about being able to bring people to heel, but we know that when we place any one in a position of power, there is always growing an appetite for more power. We see that throughout the whole of this Bill The officials of the department are trying now to gather more power than I, at any rate, feel disposed to give them. With regard to the federal authorities paying a subsidy, the argument on the subject appears to me to be idle, because we cannot imagine the State undertaking the construction of a cable and continuing to give a subsidy to a private line to compete with it. If we want private enterprise to be shut out altogether, let us say so openly and above board, and let us paste a notice up at all the ports of Australia that we intend to do that. We will then have some justification for the monopoly, but what guarantee will we have that. we shall be able' to get our messages delivered on the other side of the world? Our monopolies must cease with- our border lines. It is idle to talk of establishing a monopoly over a cable which touches other shores than our own. </para>

I do not see why the transmission of telegrams by cable should not be as .much a State monopoly as the transmission of messages by land. I do not assent to the honorable senator's proposition. There seems to me to be no necessity for extreme illustrations as to how this would work, because we know exactly what would happen. Suppose we have two cables from here to Great Britain. We have a published rate of 2s. 6d. a word, and a private company advertises that it will carry messages at the same rate. </para>

                    (South Australia). -Of course, when the debate commenced on the amendment, I, although representing South Australia, considered that we were discussing the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. I shall never put. something which is in my State as a buffer between some private monopoly and the welfare of the whole community. My fellow senators from South Australia view the question from a different stand-point, and 1 can only attribute that to a want of the federal spirit which ought to exist in them. These honorable senators talk about our transcontinental line being ruined. In what ? In the interests of Australia.

                        <para>- I am surprised at the honorable senator. A few minutes ago he said that for the first five years any surplus would be credited to South Australia, and of course any deficiency would be debited to it. I have no fear that within that period any Postmaster-General will treat his own property and the interests of the Commonwealth in such a manner as to allow South Australia to suffer. It would be unfair if he did. I am sure no matter what State he represented the Senate would not hesitate to bring any Minister to book who attempted to do such a thing. </para>

                    as to the advantage of that line from the defence and from other points of view. For fifteen years or more I have taken an active part in connexion with promoting that line, and I shall be only too glad when it is finished. I must confess that I listened with astonishment to the statement of the Postmaster-General that it was expected that the line would be opened by March next. The route has not even been surveyed yet.

                        <para>- I grant that in the meantime the Commonwealth will not have taken over this line, but the existing States will have to pay, and in that sense the Commonwealth will have to. pay. So that every pound we take from the Eastern Extension Company's line in order to give it to the Pacific line, will, to that extent, represent a pound which the Commonwealth will have to pay in increased subsidy. It is well that we should understand that, and not try to convince ourselves that by giving these facilities to those who send telegrams, we shall be benefiting only a private company. To a certain extent undoubtedly we shall, but we shall also be saving the Commonwealth an increase of the subsidy ; so that the benefits will be divided. Then I will point out to the Postmaster-General that it is utterly impossible to- prevent this being carried out. It is true that by rejecting the amendment we can entail upon the commercial public some loss and inconvenience. I may say in passing, what is probably well known, that the vast bulk of the over-sea telegrams are sent by the commercial public, and surely it is advisable that we should do what we can to assist, not to throw difficulties -in the way of our own customers. What is being done, and will be done by the commercial public, is that telegrams will be sent through Reuter's agent in Adelaide. The Post-office will thus lose this business altogether. The messages will, still go by the Cape route. The Postmaster-General cannot stop it. </para>

                    I want to say another word. Of course, I can very well understand that the majority of persons in dealing with the property 'of others adopt a certain breadth of view with respect to the terms on which it is to be acquired. Their view is altogether different from that of the individuals who happen to own the property. I have resisted that view on the part of a certain section in politics before, and even at the risk of being called provincial I resist it now. We have a line of telegraph in South Australia that cost the Government of that State a lot of money, which some day we shall have to pay. In the meantime we have to carry on the line. We do not make anything out of it. It has always been conducted at ja loss, but we want to work it at the least possible loss. We have been the benefactors of the whole Commonwealth of Australia in this case. We, a small State, undertook the work for the other States, who were timid and fearful. It is true that the others came to our help afterwards when there was no necessity, but they had not the courage to do the work themselves. Now we have to contend with a different state of tilings. We recognise, as
                    has put it, that we require another line of cable for other than merely mercantile p'urposes. It is to be used for mercantile purposes certainly, but also for military and naval purposes. It will be an advantage to have that other line. Well and good. The Commonwealth says that, and the little State of South Australia says - " We agree with you, it is a fine national feeling ; but how about us"
                    The Commonwealth establishes a new line for military and naval purposes for the benefit of all Australia, but what is the Commonwealth going to do as far as South Australia is concerned
                    All the messages from Australia may be sent by the new line, and none may be sent over the South Australian line. The result, as
                    says, will be that South Australia will be subject to a disastrous loss for five years.

I hope very seriously that those honorable senators who have spoken will reconsider the matter and support the amendment. </para>

                    (New South Wales).The honorable senator, who has just resumed his seat, has made a statement which, I take to be an absolute declaration in favour of the establishment of a Government monopoly with regard to the projected cable. That is a definite statement which I can quite understand. It would have a great deal of force if there was no private cable in existence. As there is such a cable in existence, however, that declaration must mean that by some means or other the honorable senator proposes to prohibit business on privately-owned cables. I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question. He stated a little while ago that a private cable company, having published rates equal to those fixed by the Government, might still in practice allow rebates. In that case he said it would be right to allow the Government to step in and exercise the power which the Bill gives the department.

                    (South Australia). - I am also one of those who are not afraid of being called provincialists in this matter. I look upon this proposal as a very serious attack upon the line which is already constructed, and which has been of such great service to Australia. We have heard a great deal this afternoon about the high rates that were charged by the Eastern Extension Company, and how they were ultimately reduced. It was quite natural, however, when they had to work an expensive line with very little traffic over it that they should charge high rates. With the aid of the cable communication established between Australia and Europe and America, Australia has largely benefited. We have increased our trade and commerce ; and we have increased our population, with the result that greater trade has been done. In this way the company's business has been increased, and they have been enabled to reduce their tariff. Such a thing naturally follows in all cases. As statesmen we have felt the need of other cable communication. We have felt that Australia ought to be connected with the old world by two lines, and that if we had one which passed through British territory alone, we should be on much safer ground in the case of a European war, or an occurrence of that kind. If,then, Great Britain, Canada, and the Commonwealth of Australia decide upon constructing a cable, well and good. There are certain reasons why that course should be adopted. We approve of the line being constructed, but to say that, because we believe it necessary that there should be a line passing through British territory alone, we should practically close up other lines is another matter.

I thought he gave it as an unanswerable argument why the Postmaster-General should not have the power to divert the traffic to the Government line that South Australia had patriotically built a State line from Adelaide to Port Darwin. I point out to honorable senators that Western Australia has also got a cable at Broome. The Empire cable would prejudicially affect that line, but we have not heard honorable senators from Western </para>

                        <para>- No, but the Government can prevent it by sending the messages across their own line if the rates are the same. I understand by this clause that the Government can send the messages by whichever line they like. Therefore, where the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company advertise their rate at 3s. 6d. a word, and the Government also advertise a rate of 3s. 6d., it will not matter whether the Eastern Extension Company allow a rebate privately or not, the Government can send the messages across the Government line. That is why I consider this clause so absolutely necessary. The Government department must conduct its business fairly, openly, and above board, while the private company need not necessarily do so. I do not believe that any Postmaster-General of this Commonwealth will unfairly take advantage of this clause. But I believe such a clause to be necessary in the interests of the Empire, the people of Australia, and even of the cablers themselves. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - There is one point I would like to mention to the Postmaster-General. I presume there is no reason why a State department should not be conducted on business lines, and if. he finds that an opposing company is offering inducements at a lower rate, I fail to see why he should not also be prepared to allow the same reductions.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - It is true that to a large extent my proposal is covered by clauses 27 and 41. It will be noticed that clause 27 has been copied in part from section 4 of the Victorian Post-office Act. It was afterwards found that that provision did not cover the ground. Action was taken and the Full Court decided that it did not cover the cases contemplated. A clause similar to clause 41 was then introduced, but that was found not to cover the ground. Then the section I have submitted was passed as part of the Crimes Act, and subsequent to that a definition of the word "indecent" was put in the Crimes Act. It is not a definition such as I would care to read to the committee ; but' if honorable senators would like to read it they can see what was considered necessary by the Full Court.

                    Sargoodhas not satisfied me with regard to the definition which he has just handed to me. The honorable senator objects to reading the definition to the committee, and probably honorable senators have no desire to hear it, but it merely refers to diseases which every one of us knows to exist. As I have said previously, if those diseases are in existence why should not people who suffer from them be afforded an opportunity of knowing where they can be cured ?

                        <para>- Well, I do not know. That is another matter entirely. There is a book which has been said to be, and I believe is, one of the best books we have got, and it contains very many passages that would come under the heading of "indecent" under this definition of indecency. I suppose the honorable senator knows the book to which I refer. Does he propose to prohibit the use of that book in his family, or does he propose to cull out certain passages - to edit the book- and after it has been purified and purged and cleansed of its impurity will he permit it to be circulated in his family circle ? My experience has been that young people are not in the habit of reading advertisements. They very rarely trouble their heads with the advertisements that appear in newspapers. This definition appears in the Victorian Crimes Act. The honorable senator wishes to apply it to the whole Commonwealth. A great number of very reputable British newspapers have been stopped in this holy State of Victoria. So far as my experience is any guide, however, the standard of morality iri the old country is just as high as it is in Australia ; it is certainly as high as in Victoria. I refer to the personal morality of the people. The public and commercial morality of "the people of Great Britain is very much higher than the public and commercial morality of the people of Melbourne. </para>

I simply rose to point out that the alarm expressed in this quarter of the committee is founded upon an idea that a definition which honorable senators have seen privately will have to be provided. The honorable senator who has moved this amendment may or may not intend to propose a definition, but even if he does it is not incumbent on the. committee to accept it. </para>

                    <para>- It becomes necessary to make an amendment in this clause for the sake of bringing out the meaning more clearly, and also for the purpose of making more clear the meaning of the words " the defendant neglects to appear to the writ." The difficulty; that arises is this". It appears that; the almost universal practice of the justices is to regard the failure to appear when a man has been served with a process, or a process has come to his knowledge, as being a wilful neglect. That is generally the law, but I understand that there have been some decisions in Victoria which rather alter the effect of that, and make it really very doubtful how far one has got to go into the mind of the defendant to make it appear that his failure to appear has been wilful. We have, of course, to avoid these little legal conundrums wherever we can, and I propose to make an amendment here which will make it perfectly clear that when a man has been served with a summons, or when the summons has been brought to his notice, that will be taken as sufficient to consider subsequent failure to appear as wilful. That will save all the legal difficulty, and the other amendment I would propose in the clause is simply a readjustment. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I should much prefer that the word " wilfully " should be left in. This is a very extreme power that is given in this clause. We are going to provide that a man shall be bound by a process that he has not been served with. Brown, Jones, or Robinson may have told him of it, but he may have disbelieved them, and we leave it to a Judge or to a court to say that he ought to have believed them, and should have looked after it. That is bad enough on the face of it, and though we do find it absolutely necessary to make provision that if the process comes to his knowledge he shall be bound to take notice of it, the least we can do is to say correspondingly that if he does not take notice of it he shall be shown to have wilfully neglected to do so, which I understand to mean that he knew it was genuine, and wilfully availed himself of an opportunity of evading it. I think the word " wilfully " ought to stop in the clause. I think the words - </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but within what time is he to appear? The form of the writ is "ten days after service thereof." I suppose the form will now be altered, and we will say eight or ten or 50 days, or whatever the time may be after the service thereof, or after the issue of the writ becomes known to the defendant. I suppose the writ will have to be altered to something like that form, and I think the statute should provide for that. As to the bigger question of whether or not, or to what extent a man is to be bound by knowledge of a process he has never seen, I am really not sure that the word " wilfully " in such a case is strong enough. It is not merely that I object to the word being omitted, but I am not sure that it is strong enough. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied with it. Some of my friends here may tell me that a writ has been issued against me, and I may thoroughly disbelieve them. But I will still, under the clause, have had notice of it, though I have never seen it, and do not know what it contains, or what it is about. Some one says tome - " A writ is issued against you," and I laugh and say - " I do not think so. I do not know any one who has any cause to issue a writ against me. I cannot conceive it possible, but I suppose I will hear more about it if it be true." Can it be said in that event that I wilfully neglected it? Of course not. The thing is too ridiculous! Therefore, I want something more than a mere notice, which may be accurate or inaccurate. I think it is necessary to prove that a man has notice of the writ, that he knew about it, and knowing that a writ was issued against him, knowing what it contained and all about it, he wilfully neglected to appear to it, for the purpose of defeating the ends of justice. All these conditions we have to satisfy. It is not enough to know that a writ is issued against him. We have to prove that he has notice of what is in the writ so that he knows in respect of what matters it is issued against him. Really these things which we pass a little hurriedly sometimes may be most serious in their ultimate import. I am thinking aloud, because this thing was given to me at the minute and I have only read it now for the first time. It is doing away with the service. No man can complain if he does not know what is that which he has in his hands. But directly we attribute knowledge to a man of that which lias not been given to him, which he has never seen, we have to be very careful that under this general disposition which I am afraid we have to make things easy and comfortable in administration, we do not work the most terrible and gross injustice. The more I think about the clause the less I like it. I am inclined to think that there ought to be greater precautions taken. I have perfect confidence that the law will be fairly administered, but we ought not to rely on confidence; we ought to rely on law. And all we can be satisfied of is in having confidence that the law will be properly administered. I suggest that " wilfully " covers a lot of ground, because the term " wilfully neglects " must mean that the person, knowing all about it, purposely does not act. It covers an immense amount of ground. </para>

They dispense with service, they make notice sufficient, and then they go and strike out " wilfully," which I do not think has been omitted in any legislation I have known of. I think we ought to put in that the writ shall be taken to have been served on the day on which the man had notice. </para>

                        <para>- Wilfully implies in that case that he might be served and might not know that he was to enter an appearance. But it follows, as a matter of. course, that if he gets a writ and reads it, or it is brought- to his knowledge that* he has been served with a writ, therefore he has to do something to enter an appearance. The ordinary presumption of law when a party served allows the stipulated number of days to pass by without doing anything is, that he is wilfully refusing to put in an appearance, either because he thinks he has not a case, or because he wishes to hamper the other party. The view I take on one side is that " wilfully " is to be read exactly the same as if it were used in reference to an appearance, which was to be entered by a person who had been served. It applies equally to both. </para>

An ordinary writ is served on a man, and there is a certain number of days fixed, as a matter of course, in which he has to appear. In this instance, the Minister wants to attribute service where there is none, and I agree entirely with the argument of
                    and I admit that my off-handed opinion was not as accurate as it might have been ; but now that we have the clause, why should we put the man to whom we attribute service in possibly a worse position than a man on whom we have effected service ?

                        <para>- I only submit that we ought to provide that service by notice shall be deemed to be personal service on the day on which the defendant receives notice. I am perfectly sure that the Judge will administer the provision in that way. The only question is whether when we fix times in respect to things we can deal with and we are starting a new procedure, by which we are attributing service where there has been none, we should not say that then the service shall be deemed to have been effected on the day on which the defendant has notice. That is all I am suggesting. I have sufficient confidence in any tribunal to be sure that it will act properly. At the same time I think it ought to be in the Act. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - A slight difficulty might arise if we substituted for the bringing to his knowledge that it shall be deemed to have been served on that day. For all practical purposes they are convertible terms. I think in the expression the notice " came to his knowledge" we have reference to a separate series of occurrences. The Judge may say - " I am not prepared to say that he got notice on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, but there is evidence before me that he heard something on Thursday; and was told something on Friday, and I am satisfied that he got notice." It really ought to be left to the Judge to say under these circumstances - " I will fix a time."

                        <para>- As I understand my honorable and learned friend's proposition, really for practical purposes it is the same as mine, but his proposition might work out in this way, that the Act of Parliament would deem service to be on the day on which the party had notice. Therefore the Judge might be forced to say - " Now I may find as a matter of fact that he had notice on Thursday," whereas in point of fact he might not think that the evidence justified him in going that far. He might say - "I am morally certain that he had notice on Thursday, and I am more morally certain now when I see what occurred on Friday ; but from what occurred on Saturday and Sunday I am certain that he knew," although he would not be willing to fix the day to which all the evidence points as the day on which the defendant got notice. </para>

                    DOWNER (South Australia). - Notice is knowledge. It is not a casual remark from one man to another that is intended. No one has notice of a thing unless he knows all about it. Suppose he was told something about it on Wednesday, more about it on Thursday, and the rest of it on Friday, so that by adding together the bits of information he got the whole information on Friday, then he would get notice on Friday. I still retain my opinion.

                    (Tasmania).- Perhaps
                    did not exactly follow me. In clause 1, two methods of discovery are provided - (1) ordinary personal discovery and (2) discovery by means of a registered letter, if that letter is delivered. If he receives it the man is discovered through its agency. Sub-clause (2) only comes as a necessary complement to sub-clause (1), because it refers again to the question of discovery, and says that a copy of the notification shall be left with the occupier of the land, if the owner is absent from the Commonwealth, "or cannot after diligent inquiry be found." That might be meant. to apply simply to personal service. We ought to cover the chance of his being found by the receipt of a registered letter.

                    (Western Australia). - What I should like to point out is that the amendment suggested by
                    is really in favour of the Government and of easy administration. Honorable senators will see at once that sub-clause (1) provides that the owner is to be notified by personal service or by registered letter. The second sub-clause deals with cases where that notification cannot be effective. It is only to the ease of the department to exclude the two means by which we provide for the notification before we allow to be done what is provided for in subclause (2).

As he has raised a difficulty about proof of a registered letter being delivered, I want the honorable senator to be sure that he is meeting that difficulty in the amendment.

It ought to go on to say that when two or three trustees are interested, it shall be sufficient to serve one of them. I am sure the Minister will save time and trouble hereafter if he adopts what is the 'invariable practice of having a comprehensive definition of the word " owner" including all the persons to whom I have referred. </para>

                        will see that in clause 14 there is nothing to compel the claimant to institute the proceedings within the 90 days. He cannot institute them until after the expiration of 90 days. If within that time the claimant and the Minister do not agree as to the amount of compensation, the claimant may then institute proceedings; but, suppose that period has expired, he may then delay his proceedings as long as he likes.

                    <para>- I desire to ask the Minister two questions. The first is as to the matter of costs. It should be borne in mind that we are not dealing with arbitrators, nor with a Judge sitting with a jury, but solely with a Judge of the High Court, who will know exactly what he is doing. I desire to ask if there is any precedent for providing that the costs shall go as this clause provides ? </para>

                        <para>- In some Lands Clauses Acts I am inclined to think that the provisions relating to costs are not so favorable to the Crown as is this clause. I caii' quite understand that in some cases the land-owner may consider, and his . neighbours may consider also, that he has a good reason for disputing the amount offered to him. Supposing the Judge were likewise of that opinion, he might like to order each party to pay his own costs. I suggest to the Minister that he should put in the clause the words - "unless the Judge otherwise orders." I dare say that out of every 50 cases there may be an exception to the rule, but here we take away from the Judge the discretion which should be given to him. No one knows better than lawyers that costs are generally left to the Judge. It is impossible to lay down a hard-and-fast rule. Every case must stand on its own merits. I can understand an owner bringing an action, and not taking the amount awarded to him by the arbitrator, and his friends thinking that he had good reason for not accepting that valuation. But I doubt "whether the proposal of the Bill, permitting the parties to apply for a new trial, is the correct course. Here, again, I would point out that we are not dealing with arbitrators, who constantly make mistakes in law, who sometimes do not admit evidence when it is tendered, and in other respects admit evidence which is not really evidence. Therefore, in such cases there may sometimes very well be a motion to set aside the award. But here we are dealing with a skilled Justice of the High Court. Yet the clause says that after the matter is dealt with there may be a new trial. </para>

After the evidence has been heard by a skilled Judge sitting with out a jury it is a wrong thing to throw doubt upon this tribunal. It is all a matter of opinion. The land-owner will bring before the Judge the best evidence he can produce that his land is worth so much more than the Government is willing to pay for it, whilst the Commonwealth will bring forward the best evidence it can get to show that the land is not worth so much. And when, say £1,000 is awarded, what is the use of having a new trial because the owner thinks he should receive £1,200 ? It seems to me that the provision is not consistent with the rest of the Bill. </para>

The bulk of cases will be cases where questions of law arise. They may arise in a variety of ways - through evidence having been wrongly admitted, or the principle of assessment having been wrong. It may be difficult to decide on what principle the assessment should be made. Surely the claimant should go to the highest tribunal to settle such a question of law? </para>

                        <para>- No. I say that if it is a question of fact only the Full Court would never interfere, whether as to the amount or the basis of the calculation unless there was something demonstrably wrong about it ; but if the amount depended upon some wrong principle of assessment the court would, and ought to, interfere. By leaving the words of the clause as they are, according to the practice of the High Court, I think the honorable and learned senator will find that the court will only interfere where there is a question of law involved, or where the facts have been so dealt with that no reasonable man could come to the decision arrived at. With regard to the question of costs, this clause is advisedly drafted in its present shape following a great number of similar Acts. For this reason : there ought not to be any encouragement to bring actions, and there should be every compulsion reasonably exerted to make people come to an agreement. A man who takes an action against the Crown ought to know, and the Crown ought to know if it disputes a claim against a land-owner, that the costs will be against the party who has improperly made the claim, or who ought not to have resisted the claim. The clause makes the parties do their best to come to a settlement. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the honorable and learned senator's suggestion would put the claimant or the Government - whoever was in the wrong - in the position of being able to resist a claim properly made, knowing that they would escape costs in that way. ' It is very much better . to have a provision which will prevent people disputing claims or making them when there is no ground for them, whether the party doing so be the land-owner or the Commonwealth Government. We all know that in a great many of these cases it is a matter of " heads I win and tails you lose." A man may enter into long litigation with the Commonwealth, and when the end of it is reached he may not be able to pay any costs at all. I want to discourage people from bringing actions when there is no real ground for them. On the other hand, the clause puts an obligation upon the Commonwealth officer, who is responsible to see that the valuation made is a fair one, that he can stand by under the penalty of the Government being made to pay the costs if the Commonwealth is wrong. Similar .provisions to this have worked very well for a number of years in other States. If the departure is made which the honorable and learned senator suggests, encouragement will be given to people to bring claims against the Commonwealth, and the officers of the Commonwealth will be encouraged not to be as careful as they ought to be in making their valuations. </para>

The Judge will see that the intention of the statute is that, unless there are certain substantial circumstances to the contrary, the costs shall follow the rule set out in the statute. The honorable and learned senator will recognise that, as we have amended the last portion of the clause, an amendment such as I have suggested cannot be made now, but I will undertake to recommit the clause, and alter it in the way I have mentioned. </para>

This clause has departed from the principle apparently laid down in the New South Wales Act. Section 99 of the New South Wales Act is the one which deals with the subject, and it says - </para>

If the position of the claimant in the matter of costs is to be entirely regulated by the discretion of the Judge we are introducing an unknown quantity. </para>

                        <para>- Why should we trust the Judges unless there is an absolute necessity for it. Why not trust the Judges in everything in the same way. A plaintiff may go into court and get £20,000 damages, and it might be left to the discretion of the Judge, and be in the Judge's power to say that he shall not have a penny of costs. I say that is contrary to the principles of natural justice and equity. I am arguing now in favour of the clause as it stands, I found I made a mistake about the New South Wales statute. I do not see any honesty or fairness in putting in a provision that notwithstanding the fact that the clause is in accordance with all previous legislation, the Judge shall say whether a man shall get costs or not. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, there is a jury there, and it is possible that a jury may make a mistake, where a Judge would not make a mistake. But where a jury give a claimant a larger amount against the Crown than was first offered to him, he gets costs according to the verdict which the jury give. But in this case another tribunal is appointed to deal with the matter ; a Judge hears the whole of the evidence, and deals with the whole matter himself. He may say that a man is entitled to so much money, and that costs shall abide the event whatever it may be. That is, as I think, it should be, and it should not be left to the discretion of a Judge in a case of this kind, to say that a man shall not get costs where he has practically won his' case. Where the Government are taking a man's property away from him, whether he likes it or not, he is entitled to a reasonable amount of consideration, at any rate. </para>

                        <para>- I will give the honorable and learned senator that argument in, that it is only in an exceptional case ; but is it not still very much better that a man should know exactly what his position is so far as the question of costs is concerned. I am aware that it is not possible for men to know everything that will result from a law case, but I think it is well that every man who is compelled to go into court to maintain his rights should know that if he substantially wins his case he will not be deprived of his costs. This may to some senators seem an extraordinary idea to hold, but to that all I can say is that the idea on the other side appears more extraordinary to me, because I recognise the fact that the Government themselves deliberately and with a full knowledge of the tribunal they were creating included in the Bill a clause, which is substantially what I am arguing; for now, and it is only because of certain statements which have been made that they are prepared to depart from its principle. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the; honorable and learned senator will keep an. open mind on other matters, but I am. pointing out that what I am arguing for is' the clause that the Government have themselves placed before the Senate. The Government have found that a majority, of honorable senators are opposed to what they have proposed, ' and they are willing now to abandon the position they took up in -the first instance. I do not say improperly. They may have been persuaded by the arguments adduced in this Chamber to depart from their original proposal. If the Government see fit I cannot prevent them from recommitting the clause, but, although what I have been contending for does not commend itself to the majority of honorable senators, it still appears to me to be fair and equitable. I' do not see why, in a matter of this kind, we should leave any thing to the discretion of -the Judge, unless it is absolutely necessary. I say that with. all respect to the judiciary, and with all respect to the Judges now on the bench, or to those who may occupy the bench in future/. I believe every man who goes there will be actuated by the earnest desire to do what is-, right and proper. Still Judges sometimes; take peculiar notions into their heads, and sometimes make mistakes ; and if we can lay down a particular line of action to be followed I think it is very much better that we should do so, so long as we satisfy ourselves that it is fair and just. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I am sure that Senators Gould and Keating will excuse me for saying that they have delivered very long speeches, and throughout those speeches have clearly shown that they are not very well up in the exact practice in these matters. Whatever its deficiencies in other respects, I think I can say, with the approval of every legal member of the Senate, that there is nothing at all unusual or unnatural in this clause. The suggestion made by
                    was not that the - clause was in itself contrary to the ordinary legal rule, but that in this particular case we could improve upon the ordinary rule. The ordinary rule is, as this clause. says, that if the judgment in any action is for a sum equal to or less than the amount of the valuation notified to the claimant, the claimant shall pay the costs of the action.What does that mean ? Clause 13 says that after the Government have fixed the amount of the compensation they shall inform the claimant of the amount. He can take it or leave it. If he leaves it and brings an action he does so at his own peril. The court will decide the matter if an action is taken, and if the Judge upon his calculation thinks the claimant ought to get more than the notified value, h will say he was right in bringing his action and he will give him costs ; but if the Judge comes to the conclusion that he ought not to get more, or that he ought to get less than he was originally offered, he will say he was a very foolish man to bring his action and he will not give him costs.

It applies to the land all through, in the first instance with respect to the land taken itself, and in the other cases referred to to the value taking into account the damage by severance, or by the exercise of the statutory powers by the Minister injuriously affecting the land.

                <para>SenatorDOBSON (Tasmania).- I wish to ask the honorable and learned senator a question which was asked him before, as to whether he is quite sure "that, under clause 17, the Judge trying the matter may give a certain percentage for compulsory sale. I think the honorable senator told us before that the ordinary rule would be followed, but it occurred to me that, as the clause states exactly what a Judge shall allow for compensation and that it shall be the value of the land, estate, or interest of the claimant on the 1st day of January last preceding the date of acquisition, it is possible that a percentage for compulsory sale may not be allowed. I am asking whether the clause is not so worded as to exclude the Judge from giving the ordinary 10 per cent. margin? </para>

                        <para>- I know the practice is almost invariably to give something for compulsory sale. If a mistake is made, it is not fair to make it against the' owner whose land is compulsorily taken, and it is the practice often to add from 5 per cent. up to, I believe, 25 per cent. I would like the Minister to be quite satisfied that clause 17 allows that practice to be continued. </para>

                        <para>- Under exactly similar provisions in all the States it has been constantly the practice of the court to allow this 10 per cent., and it has always expressly been put upon this ground : There is no legal right to it, but by the ordinary principle of the administration of justice where a man's land is taken, it is always supposed that the value shall not be weighed in golden scales. We are not to be particular in such matters about trifles, and it is a fair thing where a man's land is taken to allow him a little over the actual value. We cannot restrict a Judge in dealing with this matter, and if we say nothing about this he will probably come to a conclusion that the whole value of the land is a certain amount, and he will assess it at so much. We cannot prevent him from dealing liberally - with a claimant in a case where his land is taken. The question has been raised in many cases in New South Wales, I know, and it has always been held there that it is the usual practice to direct juries in that way under an exactly similar section.. These cases will be tried according to the practice of the High Court, and that practice will be followed. There is a difficulty about putting it in so many words in the clause. There may be cases in which, although a man's land is compulsorily taken, nothing ought to be allowed for a forced sale. Supposing, for instance, that it really has not been a forced sale, that he has been very anxious to get rid of the land. He has had plenty of time to get rid of it, at a value which, it is proved, is the highest possible value he can expect to obtain. There may be cases of that sort in which the court would value rigidly according to exact evidence. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that it is a forced sale. The question is -whether a man suffers any damage by that forced sale. I know that a great many persons gain by a forced . sale. In all the States there must be numerous pieces of land in the case of which the best thing that could possibly happen to the owners would be for the Government to resume. I should not think that they would claim anything or be entitled to anything for a forced sale. If we leave the thing in the elastic way in which it is, the Judge, if he thinks there has been any damage by a forced sale, will allow it in his ordinary estimate of damages, but if there has been nothing he will not allow it. I think it is very much better to leave it as it is. It always has been left to the discretion of the Judge in each case, and especially so where we have these cases tried by the Judge himself. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- It has just struck me that I did not make the most of my point, and I apologize for not doing so. In almost all the States except Tasmania there is an unimproved capital value tax. Therefore we have no Government or national value of the land. In Tasmania we have a land tax on the total value of the land, and one can turn up a roll and see the value of every bit of land in the island, assessed by Government valuers, with the right of appeal on behalf of the land-owners, and the land is taxed a halfpenny in the pound on that capital value.

                        <para>- Not only are my principles not far-fetched, but I shall show that they have been adopted by the very greatest Judges, and advocated so vehemently that they laughed to scorn the Victorian Act which embodied them for the first time. Let me bring home to the minds of honorable senators a view which puts the injustice very much more clearly. Take the work completed, take the enhancement given to the land of A, B, and C. Should A, B, or C get less money because the Government take his land than what he would get if a private proprietor were to take it ?' But put up that railway and let a private proprietor take a £1,000 worth of A's land, and he has to give £1,000. Let the Government take £1,000 worth of- his land, and they have to give him nothing. Is that fair ? </para>

                        <para>- With all respect it is not begging the question. The point I want to bring home is that clause 8 says that the Government take the corner of A's land and put down £1,000 compensation, which it is worth in the open market. Is that any reason why he should not get the benefit of the advantage to the neighbourhood the same as anybody else gets ? With B and C whose lands do not touch at all we leave them the land, but we give them the benefit. But with A we touch his land. We are not supposed, according to the Bill, to deprive him of -anything, but we are supposed to substitute foi" broad acres pounds, shillings, and pence. Do so ; give him the pounds, shillings, and pence which stand' for his broad acres, but give him the tangible benefit of the enhancement given to the whole neighbourhood. ' </para>

                        <para>- What do we say"? We admit to a man - "We are depriving you of £1,000 worth of land," but we say though we deprive you of £1,000 worth of land, though, on our own showing, we ought to pay down 1,000 solid sovereigns, still, the effect of that deprivation gives you an indirect advantage by being in the neighbourhood, and we shall subtract that indirect advantage from the sovereigns we ought to give you." If we are going to do that, why not have regard to the opposite process ? If the construction of the public work will do him an intangible injury by destroying the neighbourhood, are we going to give him compensation for it ? Nothing in the Bill says so.' Supposing the proposal is to put up a fever hospital, and we ask for 20 acres of his land for the purpose. What shall we do ? We shall compensate him for the land, no doubt, according to the market value. But shall we also give him an amount of compensation which is equivalent for the fall in the neighbourhood which the erection of the fever hospital may create ? If ' we are going to deduct from him the increment, we should add to him the decrement in the value of the land. I can well understand the fears- of persons who would argue that all this increment ought to be a matter for the State. I am not going to say whether that is right or wrong. But I submit that if the State is going to take the increment, let it take it impartially from all. Let it not take it from one as it does here. If it is intended to say, though we have taken this man's land, he has got his participation in the benefit we have done the neighbourhood, therefore we shall give him no money, I say deduct from all persons something which is equivalent to their participation in the benefit which is derived from the public work. </para>

                        <para>- That may be. At the present moment - I do not say and will not say whether I shall advocate it or not - I am not going into that great question of land nationalization. I am only looking to this aspect : Deal relatively justice to all parties, and do not by the public work give one person the benefit which the whole neighbourhood acquires, and deprive another person of that benefit together with his land. The first time this question came to be discussed, so far as I can learn, was in 1867 in'a case in court. It was the case of Eagel against the Charing Cross Railway Company, reported in the Law Reports, 2 Common Pleas. The proviso to this clause, I may mention, does not appear in the English Act. The section in that Act is exactly the same as this clause with the proviso blotted out. A case came on for arbitration for the assessment of value in these circumstances : There was a person deprived by the public works of an easement to light. The arbitrator found that that deprivation ought to be valued at JE600 odd, but he also said at the end of his report - " I find that the result of the public work is to add to the market value of the house in question £1,000." This finding came up for review before the Judges. It was argued by counsel on behalf of the pro- . rooters of the work, which would be equivalent to the Government here, that the person ought not to get £600 for this reason : that although on the one hand he had lost, on the other he had gained £1,000. What did the Judges order in that case? " What," they said, "have we to do with this man's participation in a good that was common to the whole neighbourhood ? All we have to see is that he receives an equivalent in sovereigns for the wrong done to him in destroying his easement." </para>

                    <para>Their Lordships have had great difficulty in coming to a conclusion as to what was the intention of the Legislature in the latter part of this section. They cannot agree with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court when he says that the policy of the last part of the section is obviously to enable the Government in the construction of railways or other expensive works, to recover by way of set-off to the compensation for land taken or injuriously affected a deduction for benefits resulting to the land-owner from the formation of the particular work.' He does not seem to have considered that there would be lands adjacent to the railway which would be enhanced in value by the making of it, but no part of which might be taken by the board. " The owners' of these might be equally benefited with the owners of land taken, or even more so, and would lose nothing, whilst the latter might lose the whole value of their land that was taken. If this was the intention it might have been clearly expressed. </para>

Suppose it was proposed to construct a railway to Western Australia, what a monstrous position it would be for the owners of some of those sandy wastes - for they are little better, if my honorable friends from South Australia will allow me to say so - to make claims for compensation on account of their land being taken. </para>

I know also that in Western Australia the same thing has occurred. The same condition of things existed in other States of the Commonwealth in years gone by, but as the result of their experience they concluded to alter it; and it was partly through the experience of England and partly, probably, through the experience of Western Australia, that South Australia and other States have had backbone and common sense enough to protect the general public against individuals, and so have made these laws.

                        <para>- In dealing with a matter of this kind we have first of all to consider the position of the State and the position of the individual with whom the State deals. The individual's land is taken from him, and he is compensated with hard sovereigns. If the whole of his land is taken there is an end of it ; but if only portion of his land is taken, and the balance of the land left in his hands is materially advanced in value to an amount more than equivalent to the value of the land taken away from him, as between the State and the individual, is it not a fair deal to say - " We have made the balance of your land worth double what it would have been before this improvement was put on the land which was taken from you, and, therefore, we are not going to pay you this large sum of money"? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator asks me if we have any right to lay the foundation for a taxation Bill. I think we have, arid in any case I am going to proceed on the assumption that we have, until the contrary is conclusively proved. Even if I had not that object in view, desiring as I do that equal justice should be given to every one, I do not see why. one man, simply because a railway line touches or passes through his hand, should be compelled to pay back a portion of the increased value which accrues from the construction of the railway, while other people in the same locality, and receiving the same . benefit, are not called upon to contribute anything. I think we should consider everybody alike. That is a very good principle to begin with, but this provision does not do that. It is perfectly just so far as the individual concerned is affected, but it is not just with regard to other members of the community. If we could get at them in some fashion I would be quite willing to let the clause stand as it is, but we cannot. </para>

                        <para>- I think my honorable and learned friend is mistaken about that. If, over and above the value of the land we pay him, an additional value has been given to land by the expenditure of public money on a public work, why should we pay him any part of that? I admit it may be that other persons besides the owner of land taken have been benefited, but why should we pay the owner of land taken more than he has lost? Because, after all, that is what we have to deal with. The person whose land is being taken comes to us for compensation, and we are bound to give him the compensation which will put him in the same position as he would have been in, as regards the portion of land, before the work was constructed. We do that if we give him the value of the land, and the damages, and let him have the benefit, so far as it goes, of any additional compensation. Looking at the thing practically, we all know that, in most cases, the benefit which a man derives from the public work is infinitely greater than the amount which is deducted, as against the value of the land taken.For instance, if a road goes through a property, it makes accessible a property which was inaccessible before, and thereby adds 20 or 30 or 40 per cent. to its value. </para>

                    <para>As a principle this is really no longer debatable. Even so conservative a body as the Committee of the English House of Lords, after hearing all the arguments in opposition, have recently come to the conclusion that - " The principle of betterment - in other words, the principle that persons whose property has clearly been increased in market value by an improvement effected by local authorities should specially contribute to the cost of the improvement - is not in itself unjust, and such persons can equitably be required to do so." </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend need not talk about robbing, because, as a matter of fact, the person who comes for compensation has his claim truly and well adjusted, and there is no doubt everything is always awarded on the most liberal scale to persons whose lands have been taken compulsorily for any public purpose. I merely made that quotation to show that not only is it adopted in Australia and other parts of the world, but that even in Great Britain and amongst persons of the most conservative class of opinion the principle is recognised - whether you extend it far or whether you do not - that a person who derives a benefit from a public work when his land is taken, shall not have the total value of the land, but shall have the value of the land less the amount of benefit, which he, for his adjoining land has received. I hope the committee will not assent to the amendment. </para>

                    (Queensland).This principle operates very unjustly in some cases. Supposing that a railway goes through a man's home paddock, and cuts off the only permanent water supply, the portion not cut off is then valueless. The property
                    completely destroyed, and if the man owns any land adjoining, according to the last proviso, the enhanced value of that land has to be taken into consideration as a set-off against the damage he suffers. But if a neighbour on the other side has a property which the railway does not touch in any way, he has the full advantage of the enhancement in value. It would be far better for the man if the Government took away the whole of his land. The house portion of the property is destroyed when his water supply is cut off, and the water supply portion is really valueless, because it is low, swampy ground. In a case of that kind, unless a man gets a very high compensation, he is a great loser by the railway going through his property.

                        <para>- Certainly, they obtain liberty from the Legislature, but what does it say to them ? It says to them - " We give you the right to compel persons to allow you to take their land, if you pay for what you take." The Government here do no differently. All they say is - "Instead of deputing some body else to do it, we do it ourselves." There is absolutely no difference between the two. </para>

                        <para>- Must I really put it again? Where is the difference between legislative authority under which the Government say - "Tom Jones, go and take the land," and legislative authority under which the Government say - " Government, go yourselves and take it." Both of them derive their right from legislative authority. I do seriously press this question on the committee. I have no interest in the world except my conception of what I believe to be justice. It seems to me to be a grossly unfair thing to say to a man - " We want your land, and you will not be a sufferer by reason of our taking it, because we shall plant down its equivalent in sovereigns," and when you have taken his land and he says - " Put down the equivalent in sovereigns," the Government should answer - "My friend, the equivalent is the intangible and visionary benefit which you in common with your neighbours derive." </para>

                <para>
                    (New South Wales).I should like to draw the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the rate of interest proposed under this clause. Sub-clause (2) says that the rate shall be 3 per cent. per annum. That appears to me to be altogether too low. I do not wish to suggest any figure which would be unfair to the Commonwealth, but, at any rate, the States themselves do not borrow at 3 per cent. And if they are paying more for their public loans than 3 per cent. it is not unreasonable to say that the Government shall pay at least the rate of interest that they would have to pay if they borrowed. I would suggest that 4 per cent. should be substituted for three. That rate is low enough. Very few people who have money invested in property are obtaining such a low return as 4 per cent.
