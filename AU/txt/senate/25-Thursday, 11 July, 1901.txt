                        <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                        <para>It will be within the recollection of honor able senators, no doubt, that towards the end of last month an Act was passed voting supply to the amount of £491,882. That was to cover the services and expenditure of the Commonwealth from the time of its inauguration up to the 30th June last, which was the end of the financial year. The authority given under that Act expired on the 30th June, and no payments of any kind could be made under it after that date. It becomes necessary now to ask the Senate to pass this Supply Bill which has come up from the House of Representatives, in order to defray the expenses of the Commonwealth for the next three months, and in. order also to re-vote certain sums which it was impossible to expend during the limited time between the passing of the last Supply Act and the 30th June.It has been determined, as has been stated already, that the financial year of the Commonwealth shall end on the 30th June in each year. The proposal which is now before the Senate is for an advance out of the moneys which will be covered by the Appropriation Bill for the year ending the 30th June next - that is, a three months' advance. It is rendered necessary by reason of the impossibility of passing the ordinary Appropriation Bill in time for the payment of the various services which have to be defrayed during the next three months. The amount of supply now asked for is £1,010,732.I may say in the first place, in regard to the form in which the Bill comes before the Senate, that it will be noticed that the items in most cases are set out in a schedule similar to the schedule which was contained in the last Supply Bill passed by the Senate. But there are certain services which are set out very generally. For instance, under the heading of"Minister for External Affairs- The Senate," there is a vote for salaries so much, and contingencies so much, without any particulars. There is a note at the end of the schedule which, no doubt, honorable senators have seen, stating that - </para>
                        <para>The amounts of salaries included in the column " other expenditure " are, except where specifically set forth in this schedule, provided only for officers included in the schedule to Act No. 1, and at the rates set forth in that schedule. </para>

                            <para>- It is called by different names - new expenditure, or original expenditure. At all events it is expenditure which becomes a separate charge upon the Commonwealth as contrasted with the bookkeeping charges. This new expenditure amounts to £52,532. So that the Bill provides for transferred services to the amount of £933,200, and new federal services to the amount of £52,532. Then there is an instalment of the Treasurer's advance, amounting to £25,000, which, I think, considering that the Supply is for three months, and having regard to the expenses that' may arise in carrying out new administration, is not an excessive amount. I do not think there will be much question as to the £933,200 transferred services, because they go on very much as usual, the only difference being in the necessary extension of services which naturally comes with an increase of population and business. In regard to the new or federal services, there are certain features which I think deserve the attention of the Senate. In the first place, it will be noticed that certain of the services are of an exceptional character. That is to say, although they may occur under the heading of ordinary annual appropriations they are services of a special character. We find, for instance, that there is an amount of £2,500 for the celebrations in connexion with the opening of the Federal Parliament. I may say that that sum is the final amount under that heading. </para>

                            <para>- £500 is are-vote, and the rest, £2,000, is new. Then there is tm amount of £12,000, which is a re-vote for expenses under the Electoral Acts of the different States. On the last occasion when Supply was, voted, £20,000 was appropriated for this purpose, but as the vote was made available only after the passing of the Act - which, on account of circumstances to which I need not now refer, took place a very few days before the end of- the month - it was impossible to spend all the money within the time, and as the authority lapsed at the end of the month, a certain sum has to be revoted. £12,000 is the amount unexpended which we now ask to have re-voted. In connexion with the army and navy demonstration, there is an amount of £8,959. Altogether these items amount to £23,000. So that out of the £52,000 of federal expenditure, £23,000 is for services of an unusual and special character, leaving the sum of £29,000 for what may be termed the usual expenditure for the working of the new departments. That being the general scope of the Bill - that is to say, the bulk of the money being for transferred services and appropriations for unusual services, and £29,000 being ordinary expenditure in connexion with new departments - I need only refer now to a few matters of detail, which I think it is well the Senate should have explained at once, as there may not be an opportunity of explaining them in committee. If honorable senators will look under the heading of " The House of Representatives " they will find the item - </para>

                        <para>- It is not easy at the present juncture to enter into any critical examination of the details of expenditure, because the information that is required for a proper examination of the financial arrangements of the Government is not yet before us. But this is a time when we should fix in our minds the importance of questions of finance to Australia generally. The crying need of the time undoubtedly is economy, and we ought to be alive to the importance of keeping down expenditure in every possible direction. At present the two principal States of Australia are in the position of having heavy deficits. During the year just passed in several States there have been very material increases of revenue, due not to any enlargement of trade or consumption of goods, but to a forestalling of the trade of the year upon which we have now entered. Strange to say, although hundreds of thousands of pounds of the new year's income have been already paid into the Treasury, means have been found in the various States of spending, I believe, the whole of the money, and I fear in some instances of even exceeding it. This state of things points to considerable stringency in the future, and it is desirable that the Treasurers of the States should bear in mind that the taking over by the Commonwealth of that most elastic of all sources of revenue, Customs and Excise, will alter very materially the conditions under which they will in future have to administer the finances of their respective States. In the past if a State has been deficient in income, or if there has been a desire to increase expenditure, it has been an easy thing to say - " We will put a further duty upon this or upon that," but individual States in future will not have this elastic resource. There will be a rigidity about State finances which happily must tend in the direction of economy, and in clipping the wings of too generous Treasurers. It is desirable that State Treasurers should recognise the position on which we have entered. I fear that, instead of an all-round determination that the policy of economy shall be carefully pursued, there has been a very general tendency in the opposite direction. The expenditure in the States which have now undertaken the payment of old-age pensions - an enormous expenditure,, undertaken, I fear, without due consideration - will prove in the period on which we are now entering to be a very serious burden, and will necessitate economy in every direction. </para>

                            <para>- I think I have said in this Senate before to-day that I have looked upon federation as a system of co-operative government. Under federation the departments of the various States are brought together1, and work as a whole. This ought, therefore, to enable very material savings to be effected. But as yet very little effort has been made in that direction. I think it would be a very desirable thing for the Federal Government to take some steps to draw the attention of Treasurers of the States to the importance of this matter, and to try to get some conference or some arrangement made whereby the savings which we have all thought possible might be effected. This would be to the great advantage of the respective States. I am quite certain that in the future every saving that can be effected will be required to balance the finances of the States. In dealing with this question of economy, we cannot help regarding the fact that the Government are wedded to a fiscal policy which, instead of being an economical one, of necessity involves the reckless and wasteful expenditure of the wealth of the public. </para>

                        has informed the Senate that the Government propose to give protection to the sugar industry to a very heavy extent, and the Prime Minister, in reply to a deputation, has also publicly stated that he intends to protect the sugar industry. That means that hundreds of thousands of pounds, which hitherto have gone into the coffers of the respective Treasuries, are now to go into the pockets of the individuals engaged in that industry. I say that that is not economical administration ; it is wasteful administration. It is a very serious matter that loss of revenue and waste of public wealth should be inaugurated at a time when every condition of public life calls upon us to be as economical and as saving as we can in our public and private expenditure.

I rise to congratulate the Minister in charge of this Bill upon the very full and fair manner in which he has placed the figures before us. I must say that to me, as an ex-member of the Upper House of Victoria, it is a novel experience to find the Estimates of the expenditure of a country thus laid before a second Chamber. I hail it as another and a pleasing illustration of the . fact that this Chamber occupies a very different position from that of a State Legislative Council. </para>

The various items are placed under the heads of different departments, and I find, for the first time, that the Senate and House of Representatives - the Parliament, in fact - is within the department of the Minister for External. Affairs. I did not know that Parliament was under any Minister. I am aware, of course, that the Estimates have to be prepared by some Minister ; but I think it is rather irregular to include them in this form. I am aware that it has been the practice in Victoria for years ;but I believe I am right in saying that it is not so in New South Wales, where, I believe, the two Houses prepare their own Estimates, and submit them to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- In conjunction with other senators, I would like to be allowed to congratulate the Honorable the Vice-President of the Executive Council upon his very lucid exposition of this Supply Bill. I think it must be admitted that the amount asked for is a rather unpleasant surprise not only to members of this Senate, but also to the people of Australia. If the Estimates of the Treasurer be correct - and as he has a reputation as a Treasurer throughout Australia, I think that we can assume that they are fairly correct - this Supply for three months is in excess of all previous Estimates that were formed during the time of the holding of the conventions, and during the time of the elections. There is no doubt that in some of the smaller States, such as Western Australia and Tasmania, the revenue will be reduced even below the estimate made at the Adelaide session of the Convention, and when this very much increased expenditure is required - I believe it will amount to nearly £1,000,000 - it is avery serious thing for those States, and for other States in the Commonwealth, too. I think that now is the time when Members of Parliament should express an opinion as to the proper amount of the Commonwealth expenditure. It is all very well to wait until the Estimates come on, in three months' time, but it would be well for senators, who represent States, and not merely constituencies, to give an opinion at the present time as to the amount of this expenditure, and, if possible, to endeavour to have it reduced. I think it must be admitted that all the transferred departments are being conducted on a much more lavish scale by the Commonwealth than the individual States. </para>

It seems to me that this is a very serious matter. It should be the duty of the Government to curtail expenditure as much as possible. I have no doubt that if the Postal department is conducted as I understand the Postmaster-General is going to conduct it, there will be a considerable saving effected. I believe that the imposition of postage upon newspapers will increase the revenue of that department.

                            <para>- This supply is only for three months, but the Treasurer is known to be so careful in his figures that we may assume that the estimate is a very reliable one. We find that while the Ministers for Home Affairs, for Trade and Customs, the Treasurer, and the Attorney-General, each have secretaries getting £750 a year, the secretary of the Defence department is to have £900 a year, though possibly his duties will not be greater than those of the other secretaries. We have had it explained by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that this is because he has been taken over from the State service. </para>

                            <para>- If we decided that the Secretary for' Defence should be paid £750 a year, an officer who did not care to accept that salary would have it in his power to refuse it, and I think we should not give these people these high salaries merely because they were receiving them from a State. Of course, Ministers say that this will be discontinued when the officer gives up his office, which may be in 20 years time, because I notice that people who get high salaries generally live to a great age. The Government have adopted the policy of transferring the highest salaried officers of the States to the Commonwealth Government. It may have been necessary in some instances to do that, but it piles up the expenditure. There is another item - repairs for three months, £9,300. I think that is very lavish expenditure- for three months. It is no doubt due to the fitting up lavishly of various rooms and offices for Ministers, civil servants, and other people. There is also an expenditure of thousands of pounds for printing. I know there is a building and machinery belonging to the State of Victoria, and are we going to buy machinery and put it up alongside the State machinery, and work them together ? </para>

They will mean a very much increased expenditure. I consider it to be the duty of the Government to reduce the expenditure, if possible, and' to work with a minimum expenditure, at any rate until the departments are properly transferred, and they are able to ascertain what the revenue is likely to be, and what the loss to the" various States - which I am looking at principally - on account of federation will be. The Government are creating a lot of departments and a lot of offices. We see in some departments three or four messengers, and soon every clerk will have a messenger to watch at his door and run his errands. </para>

                            <para>- I want to direct attention to this fact - that there will be a considerably larger amount of money to be found by the Parliament within a short time. For instance, the High Court is to be established directly, and we hear it suggested that there shall be four or five Judges, all of whom are to receive very liberal allowances. Then there will be the salaries of the Inter-State Commissioners, and those of the Public Service Commissioner and his staff, and the salaries of the staff in connexion with the administration of justice. So that honorable senators will have to bear in mind that there are a considerable number of claims that will crop up during the next three months, which will materially increase the expenditure beyond what is contemplated by this measure. I would also remind the Senate that when it is stated that the cost of the Commonwealth will be less than some people originally estimated, it seems to be forgotten that "under this schedule we do not contemplate spending much money in the way of repairs to public buildings, renewals, or on anything of that kind. Honorable senators will find that the small amount of money provided for that purpose will be trivial compared with the amount which will be necessary for carrying on the work of the different departments. It is just as well to bear these facts an mind, and not to run away with the idea that, because it appears that we are asked to vote only a small amount of money now, this can be regarded as a fail average of our expenditure in the future. I do not suppose the amount we are voting now will be half of the ordinary expenditure during a period of three months once we get the Commonwealth Government into working order. There is a tendency, I am afraid, in certain cases, to pay large salaries. I know that where officers have been transferred there is a difficulty. It is unfortunate for the Commonwealth that these officers are gentlemen who were receiving larger salaries than it is intended to pay in the future. </para>

                            <para>- Possibly ; but it is a pity that we shall have during a certain period - say three months or twelve - to vote a large salary for a certain office, and that as soon as the gentleman occupying that office goes away, the man who succeeds him will receive a much smaller salary. Incidents of this kind generally give rise to dissatisfaction in a service. Possibly the Government were in a fix in dealing with the officers in the way they have done. </para>

Upon the Estimates of those States the expenditure connected with the Legislature is put under a separate heading, and the departments are under the administration of the President and the Speaker respectively. In our case the officers of the Senate ought to be under the administration of the President, who would be the gentleman to make recommendations with regard to the salaries of officers, and the giving of increments to them. These officers should be in no wise under the control of any Minister of the Crown. </para>

                            <para>- It also means, I take it, that if we want a few more clerks the President or the Speaker would have to send a request to the Minister. What I contend is, that if it became necessary to appoint another clerk for the Senate, the President should do it, and the Prime Minister should follow his recommendation, leaving the Senate to deal with its expenditure, and the House of Representatives to deal with the expenditure in connexion with the other branch of the Legislature. The expenditure of the Legislature should be in no wise under the control or surveillance of any Minister of the Crown. </para>

                            <para>- If the Speaker or the President wishes to recommend an increase of salary for any member of the staff, he should be able to do so. Even though it may become necessary, as a matter of routine, to pass the matter through some other department, it should appear upon the Estimates as a recommendation of the President or the Speaker. The true principle is to keep the officers of the two Houses, and the other departments connected with Parliament, entirely independent of Ministerial control.. Matters of this kind should not be dependent upon the whim or caprice of a Minister. It must be remembered that it is not within the power of the Senate to increase by one single fraction the Estimates submitted to Parliament. We should, therefore, look to the President or the Speaker to make the necessary recommendations for appointments, or for increases of salary. I hope that Ministers will in future regard these departments as entirely differentiated from the ordinary departments, and let them each rest upon their own basis and authority. By that means the independence of the Legislature will be preserved, and will not be placed under the control of Ministers in any way whatever. Ministers should look after the administration of the affairs of the country generally, but they are not charged with the management of the affairs of the two Houses. I am informed that what I have advocated has not been the practice in Victoria, but, as I have already said, it is certainly the practice in New South Wales and South Australia. My contention is that the true and proper rule upon which to base the control of the officers of the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Parliamentary Debates staff, is that they should be managed by the Speaker and the President, and not by any Minister at all. I understand that appointments are really made by the President and the Speaker jointly. I do not know whether that has been done in the case of officers already appointed, but it should certainly be done in future, even in the case of messengers. Of course, at the present time there is not much to be said in regard to the Estimates. We can only trust at this stage of our proceedings that the Government will exercise reasonable economy. I do not say rigid economy, because I do not believe it to be true economy to underpay any person for services rendered. But I hope the Government will exercise a system of economy which will promote efficiency while it does not unduly harass the administration of the departments of the Commonwealth. Because we have a limited revenue. If we are to take our revenue entirely from the Customs we must bear in mind that for every pound we raise from that source, for the purposes of the Commonwealth, we have to obtain £4 from the people, and return £3 to the States. Therefore, it is in the highest degree essential that the Government should exercise economy as far as they can. It is also desirable that the States shall realize, that while we take over certain services from their hands, it is their duty as far as they can to exercise the strictest economy in the administration of their finances. I know that there is always a tendency for Treasurers when they find the money coming in to see how quickly they can spend it. A Treasurer rarely thinks that he owes so much money, and has large obligations to meet in the future. He seems to think only of the present moment, and to believe that as he has the money, he ought to spend it. I hope, however, that whilst we exercise economy the States will exert their efforts in the same direction. </para>

It is strange that South Australia, which also has a great number of ports and an exceedingly extensive territory, should be able to manage to collect the whole of her customs duties for about £6,200, whereas Queensland pays £15,750 for the same work. </para>

In New South Wales it comes to something like £63,000, in Victoria it amounts to £64,000, and in Queensland to £52,000, while in South Australia it is only £13,000. </para>

                            <para>- What I wish to point out is that we in South Australia have been exceedingly moderate in all matters, whether they relate to the Postal department, or the military forces, or any other branch of the service. We have been economical, and yet we have been paying fair salaries as a whole. There has been little or no complaint except when, for a short time, in consequence of the great depression, we had to keep back the ordinary increments. There is a fear on the part of South Australia that the Commonwealth will not work the transferred departments so cheaply as that State has done. I hope these fears will not be realized. So far as the post-office is concerned, I feel assured that the Postmaster-General will be exceedingly careful. I trust that the Government will be especially careful, and that we shall not have any extravagance in this direction. In looking through the Bill, I find that there is nothing in it to show that it is a measure providing for three months' Supply. There is a statement in it that no moneys shall be expended under the authority of this Act after the 30th day of June, 1902. That carries it to the end of the financial year. When we come to the first clause of the Bill, we find that the </para>

                            <para>- I think it is right that the Government should come to Parliament in such circumstances. If they estimate that the expenditure will amount to a certain sum for a certain period, and the amount provided is not expended within that period, the Government should come to Parliament again when the time is up. The time was fixed in the last Supply Bill. This is a Supply Bill. It so happens that there are a few lines of estimates put in, but there is not the slightest necessity for that. It should be strictly limited in its period, as an ordinary Supply Bill is limited. What the Government have done is to word it in such a way that they can spend the money voted for the three months during the whole year if they choose to do so. It is not, therefore, a. Supply Bill for three months. I think this is a mistake. The Bill ought to contain words limiting it to the time which it is asked for. If the Treasurer wanted Supply for four months, I dare say we should have given it to him, and if at the end of that period he wanted a further extension of one, two, or three months, we would pass a second Bill. That is frequently done. It would be better for the Bill to say on the face of it that it is for the purpose of carrying on the Government for three months, and for three months only. I therefore think that it should be amended, so as to give effect to what the Minister has informed us the Government really desire. </para>

I made an assertion just now that the Supply Bills were limited to three months, and not carried on to the end of the year. I was under the impression at the time that that was so, but I find on looking at a Supply Bill for South Australia, that it is taken on to the end of the year.

                            <para>- According to press reports they do. A State that cannot afford to pay 7s. a day to its workmen, cannot afford to pay £4 a day to any man, no matter how high his position may be. Some honorable senators are always talking of high salaries for these officials, but they take up a different position when it comes to working men receiving a living rate of wages. If the Government want to discredit federation, this is just the right kind of tack to go on. I hold that it is our duty to try and economize as much as possible, but there is no economy in a condition of affairs which allows us to pay £4 a day to one man, and to refuse 7s. a day to another. An alleged comic paper published in this city has drawn attention to the hours which we keep some of our officials working. It asserts that we sweat them by keeping them here 70 hours a week. If that is so, the hours ought to be reduced. </para>

I find however that that is wrong, and that I was right in my first contention. I have discovered the Supply Bill was introduced at the end of September, and was for the last three months of the year. No payments were to be made after that date.

                            <para>- I would not ask that Members of Parliament be paid in the ratio of their capacities, because we all recognise an equality with one another when we are in 'this Chamber. My object in rising was to give some assurance to the representatives of the Government, that on my part, instead of being discouraged, they will meet with every encouragement in awarding adequate salaries to such officers as may be necessary. It is not because this is a Government service that we are not to have the best men. If a man is worth £2,000 or £5,000 a year to a private employer, the Commonwealth must pay him that wage, if it wants his services. If the revenue at its disposal will not enable it to pay that amount, the amount must not fall but the revenue must increase. Take for instance what we will probably be discussing very soon - the salaries of our Judges. It is no answer to mo to say that we have a certain amount to spare, and, therefore, we cannot give our Judges more than a certain sum. We must give our Judges what will enable us to get the best men, and if our revenue is not sufficient for the purpose we must increase our revenue, or go without the Judges. </para>

                        <para>- I was not in any way astonished at the remarks that fell from the lips of the last honorable senator who spoke. We never hear economy urged in this chamber, or elsewhere, by members of the legal profession when the salaries of highly paid officials are in question, but when we come down to the rank and file - the hewers of wood and the drawers of water, in the federal service: - we are told that if they are not satisfied with the pay they are receiving, they should go out into the wet, and get what they can in the open labour market. That is always the cry. I think there is a limit to that sort of thing in the higher walks of the civil service as well as in the lower. Honorable senators talk about mine managers getting £8,000 and £10,000 a year. I believe the manager of the Chillagoe mines was paid a salary of somewhere about £10,000 ; but for what reason? We must dive below the surface when we come to deal with facts of this character. We know perfectly well why that man was paid £10,000 a year. It was for advertising purposes, neither more nor less - to boom Chillagoe shares in the market. It was hoped that investors with their eyes shut, and their mouths wide open, prepared to swallow anything, would' say that this particular company was actually paying £10,000 a year to its manager. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing the man's qualifications at all. I am simply trying to dissect the reasons why he was paid this particular salary. They would say - " The resources of this company are evidently very rich, when they can pay such a salary to their manager, and it must be a very good thing to invest in." I think it is absolutely essential that we go in for economy, and I think we can get good men without paying extravagantly high salaries. We always hear about what people outside pay, but I find there is a perfect stampede to get into the public service. The rush is not into private employment, the rush is into public employment, and the only fair deduction from that is that public employment is better than private employment. It is better in various ways. There is more security about it. The State has a continuous, existence, and if a man once gets into the public service and behaves himself and does his work in a fairly efficient manner, he is settled for life. </para>

That gentleman is the first judicial functionary for a population of somewhere between 70,000,000 and 80,000,000. Now the Chief Justice of Queensland, with a population of between 400,000 or500,000, or 150th of the United States, and about 1,000th of its riches, gets £3,500 per annum. </para>

When, however, we compare the management of the affairs of Queensland with that of South Australia, the matter is entirely reversed.

                            <para>- Probably. If we "bring up a man on the heather, he learns to live on the heather on the rocks, but if we place him on fertile fields his desires may be quite different. At any rate, I think the people of South Australia have shown an excellent example which the Commonwealth will do well to follow. South Australia has made the very best of her poor resources, whilst some of the other States have made the worst of theirs. When we compare the expenditure of the different States upon defence, for instance, we find that in New South Wales it amounts to £63,000, in Victoria to £64,000, in' Queensland to £52,000. Queensland appears to be the biggest sinner of the lot. She has less than half the population of New South Wales and Victoria, and yet her military expenditure is almost as great as theirs. </para>

                            <para>- In South Australia the military expenditure falls to £ 13,000. The authorities of the Commonwealth might very well consider whether it would not be possible to take South Australia as setting the pace on defence matters, rather than any of the other States. Then we come to the Postmaster.General's department. In New South Wales the cost is £216,000, and in Victoria £160,000. Just here I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether the Commonwealth is to bear the deficiency which will probably arise from the establishment of the penny post in Victoria ? </para>

                            <para>- The enemies have not come yet, and it is not wise to be quite sure that you are on the safe side and cut down your fire insurance merely because you have not been previously burnt out. A colonial defence force is, in my humble opinion, in the light of an insurance fund. Such a force exists for the purpose of protection, and is not intended for aggressive operations - or, at any rate, should not be. We effect insurance not because we expect we are going to be burnt out, but to get the protection which the policy gives us when our premiums are invested in a. sound concern. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in the habit of disturbing my honorable friend with questions, and I do not think it is in accordance with parliamentary custom that he should maintain a running comment on every sentence I utter. The investment of premiums with an unsound company is, of course, a very unwise expenditure, and equally unwise would be any expenditure of public money upon a defence that was not as efficient as it was capable of being made. But perhaps it will be more convenient if I give the figures for the different States before I make any further comments upon them. In South Australia the strength of the defence force is represented at 2,770 men, and the proposed expenditure under this Bill is £13,000, that is, at the rate of about £4,300 per 1,000 men. </para>

                            <para>- I am not in the position to say what is the value attaching to the rifle clubs in the different States. In some cases they may be quasi-military forces, but in other cases they are practically pot-hunters and have no value as a military force. The shooting powers of the men may be excellent, but without regular training and cohesion, they ought not to be included under the head of military forces. </para>

                            <para>- I only desire to point out that there are considerable differences between the cost of the different forces. These are matters which I assume will be brought, as far as possible, upon equal terms under the defence system of the Commonwealth that is being inaugurated. At the present time I believe these sums are required for expenditure under existing Acts. How it is that the Minister for Defence is administering the forces under Acts of Parliament passed in the different States, which he has not been authorized to administer, I do not know. </para>

I am not taking exception to what is being done. I have no doubt that the very best course is being adopted in regard to the defence forces.

                        (Western Australia).I wish to join in the echo as to the need of economy in federal expenditure which has resounded through the Senate. I trust that it will continue to be heard when we get into committee, because it is very little use for us to make appeals for economy in second reading speeches, unless we are prepared to take some practical step in that direction in committee. There are one' or two items in the schedule which fairly call for amendment in the direction of economy. The first, that strikes my attention is that of Secretary for Defence at a salary of £900 per annum. We -are indebted to the Vice-President of the Executive Council for his words of introduction, especially in regard to this officer. I understand that he comes over with the transferred department, and that he received this salary from the State of Victoria while acting in its service as Secretary for Defence. I am given to understand that there are also similar officers in other States. What is going to be done with them? I believe that some of them are not to be taken over with the transferred services, and that the State Governments will have to find appointments for them in their service. In my opinion the Government are placing themselves in a false position.
                        has intimated that this item does not necessarily mean that the salary of £900 per annum will attach to the office. If it is not, then let us say so from the outset.

                            <para>- I am in favour of striking out the item, because we ought not to allow Victoria to dictate to us what the salary of this officer shall be. If a salary of £750 per annum is sufficient for the Secretary of Customs and for the Secretary for Home Affairs, then I think £750 should be ample for the Secretary for Defence. I do not see why we should pay him £900 per annum for five years when we, are all agreed that £750 a year would be ample. </para>

                            <para>- If we take this officer over we pay him £900 per annum for five years. I see no reason why we should not provide that the salary of the office should be £750 per annum. The only way to achieve that object, as the appointment is about to be made, is for the Senate to emphasize its opinion by striking out the item. There would still be sufficient officials engaged at reasonable salaries to carry out the work of this department. What is the work? We have not got a large body of men, but rather small skeleton forces scattered over the country, and yet we have an enormous staff to carry out the work in conjunction with the State officers. Is it necessary that there should be a secretary, a chief accountant, and a chief clerk? In my opinion the office of secretary is totally unnecessary. In the interests of economy which has been so energetically propounded in the Senate this afternoon, I think that honorable senators should support the striking out of this item. I cannot see that we would serve any useful purpose by reducing the item, as the officer is at present receiving this salary, but I will move later on that it be struck out. The argument that because he is in receipt of the salary now we ought to continue to pay it to him does not apply. We should use our discretion. If the Government cannot convince us that there is sufficient need for such a highly paid officer, we ought to omit this vote. The next item that calls for attention is that of the expenditure on the defences in the various States, and the disproportion disclosed in regard to them by this schedule. In Queensland the defence expenditure is estimated at the enormous sum of £52,000. Queensland has suffered from drought, and is face to face with a huge deficit. If this department had not been transferred, what would that State have done with it? Do honorable senators think it would have allowed this heavy expenditure to go on ? </para>

                        (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - Nearly all the arguments that I have heard this afternoon are based on the amounts that are asked for for the next three months in connexion with the transferred departments, and they appear to me to be entirely fallacious. Of course it is possible that the expenditure of these departments may be more than it has been in the past. On the other hand, it is equally possible that the expenditure may be very much less. I hope that in most cases it will be less, because I think that as the result of the consolidation of these departments there will be openings for economies which I trust will be effective. But no argument can be founded upon these figures for the simple reason that they are based on the expenditure of last year.

                            <para>- Quite so. I believe that Queensland has stood very well in the past in regard to military matters, and that ' her defence force, small- as it is, will compare perhaps with the forces of any of the other States. I hope, therefore, that no attempt will be made to interfere with the freedom of action of the Minister for Defence in this matter. </para>

                        (Victoria). - I am very glad to hear honorable senators on my right stating that they are determined to preach and practise economy. I give my pledge here now that I will support them. I have given pledges to the electors of this State that I will urge economy on the Commonwealth Government, and I will not break my pledges in that regard. In saying that, I acknowledge at1 the same time that all the civil servants should be well paid* but there should be no civil servants foisted upon this Commonwealth who are not capable, and who are not required, or who can be done without. I am sorry I was not present to hear all the honorable senators who have spoken, but if we commence this Commonwealth in an extravagant manner we will get into financial trouble, and that will be a very great pity. I have no. doubt, as a citizen of this great Commonwealth, that its resources are very great, but I regret to say that we do periodically get under a cloud. We have passed through very trying times, not so much in this State as in some of the others. Droughts have been referred to, and in that respect we have passed through very trying times in New South Wales and Queensland. I am pleased to state here that I believe Queensland has now passed through one of the worst droughts ever seen in Australia since Australia has been .known. Unfortunately, when the drought is over, the stock are dead, and grass will not return money unless there is stock to feed on it. That is the unfortunate part of it, and I acknowledge that Queensland is likely - I was going to say to fall into financial difficulties, hut I will say is likely to have to put up with a deficit for a couple of years unless retrenchment is practised severely. I am pleased to know that the Premier of that great State says there is no necessity for drastic retrenchment there Because of the great recuperative power of the State. Its exports per head are greater than the exports per head of any of the other States notwithstanding the drought. We cannot judge of the expenditure exactly by this Supply Bill, and I do not see how we can find fault with it in most respects. There is nothing in it, so far as I can see at present, to criticise. When the next Supply Bill comes before us, and when we get the Appropriation Bill, we shall be enabled to put our fingers upon any weak spot. I hope and believe that there will be no weak spot, because I am satisfied that the Government is anxious to do what it is pledged to do.

                            <para>- I am glad to hear the Minister say "hear, hear" to that, because that strengthens my faith. I will not discuss this Bill further; but when we have before us the Appropriation Bill covering the expenditure for the year it will be our bounden duty to criticise the Estimates keenly, and I will support any party or the whole Senate in doing our duty to the Commonwealth in this respect. It must be remembered that for a few years we shall not get the full benefit of federation. Unfortunately we are to have a bookkeeping system for five years, and we cannot get the full benefits of federation for some time ; but I anticipate that after a few years there will be great commercial advantages arising from federation. For the present we have to be economical and careful. I hope that when the facts are known some time hence we shall have no reason to complain of the present Government, and I am sure they wish to do what is right in reference to this matter. I know that very great pressure is brought upon any Government, and there is great pressure brought to bear on all honorable senators. Already many of us have had to resist pressure, and it is our bounden duty to resist it. There are some cases in which civil servants are taken over from State departments to Commonwealth departments, and they must, of course, be paid the salaries they received from the State. They cannot be taken over at less. That is provided for in the Commonwealth Constitution. I am glad, however, to know that where the salaries of men taken over are probably too high they are not necessarily to be made permanent, and that the Appropriation Bill will show the exact salary attached to each position. I shall be no party to a proposal for the striking out of any item in this Bill, because I see no justification for it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will find that they ave not more. He will find that it is , very fallacious to take the Estimates for last year in any State. Not only must we take the whole expenditure for the year, but if we find in a money-earning department like the Customs or the Post-office that by the increase of population year by year a certain amount must necessarily be added to the expenditure, as a certain amount is necessarily added to the earnings, we must make fair provision for expansion in the next year's Estimates. So that to arrive at an estimate of what these three months will cost in the States, we have been obliged to take the basis of last year. That is the basis upon which these particular Estimates are placed before the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary, we pledge ourselves to use the utmost economy in the spending of the money. I make these general observations in regard to the transferred services for a purpose. It is said that certain States are more extravagant than others. That condition of things necessarily arises from the absence of uniform legislation regarding the departments. When the Government took over the departments, their first duty on meeting Parliament was to ask for legislation to enable them to treat uniformly all the departments of the different States, and, until they can be so treated, we must continue them on the old basis, and spend the money on the old basis. During this period of three months, therefore, our expenditure must be on the old basis. If we were to attempt to cut and slash at one State, simply because the expenditure last year happened to be more in that State than in another, see what a gross injustice it would be. </para>

                            <para>- We mean the same thing, but we are using different terms. There must be a Minister responsible for the expenditure, but it does not follow that because there must be Ministerial responsibility for expenditure, there need be any official subordination. I think that is what the Senate refers to. In so far as any official control is concerned, the President and the Speaker will be put in practically an independent position. Of. course, the amount of money which is to be expended must rest in the hands of a responsible Minister, and it must be in the power of a responsible Minister to say whether any officer is to have a salary of £200, £300, or £350, or whether an extra officer is required. It must be in the power of a Minister to say "no" to a proposition of that kind. </para>

However, we need not go into that question now, though I quite agree that the subject is worthy of some consideration. I also consider that the position in which the Estimates are placed under this heading is a matter worthy to be looked into, and I undertake to look into it before the Estimates are brought forward again, in order to see what can be done to put, the matter in a different position. I may say without binding the Ministry in any way whatever, that I have a strong sympathy with the contention that where you have two Houses of Legislature, under a Constitution such as ours, each House ought to be put in a position of absolute independence as to its machinery. Whether that is brought about by putting the officers of the two Houses on a statutory basis, or in some other way, I do not think it necessary to inquire at the present moment. The subject will be inquired into, and when the principal Estimates are laid upon the table of the Senate, some indication will be given as to the opinion arrived at by the Government, and I hope it will be satisfactory to the Senate. I do not think there are any other matters requiring reference. Let me merely say, in conclusion, that there is an urgent necessity for passing this Bill without any unnecessary delay. The public creditor, as has been said by the Treasurer in another place, is waiting to be paid. There is no power in connexion with these re-votes to pay a single farthing until this measure becomes law. I therefore trust that the Senate will not only allow the Bill to be read a second time, but will pass it through without any suggestions which would be likely to cause delay in another place. </para>

If the Bill is so urgent, why was it not introduced a week earlier?When I was speaking on the motion for the second reading I said that the expenditure set down was not the aggregate expenditure of the States for the twelve months but an increased amount.

I then strongly objected. I wish it to be plainly understood that in objecting to the proposal now I realize that we have to contend with an entirely different set of circumstances. On the former occasion we were asked to suspend the standing orders and deal with the Bill from end to end at one sitting. At present we have had an opportunity of fully discussing the measure on the second reading, and all that is asked is that the third reading may be taken at a later stage. I make no objection to that under present circumstances.

I would suggest that it would be more convenient if the motion came on after the Bill was reported from the committee. Probably I am fond of the usages to which I have been accustomed, but it appears to me that the desire of the Government would be equally well met if the motion were moved when the Bill came out of committee. I am going to support the Government if they persist in this course, but I merely make a suggestion for their consideration. </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary, I think the more convenient course is to move the motion for the suspension of the standing orders as early as possible, because honorable senators then know that there is a probability of a Bill being; passed through some stages which could not be taken if the standing orders were not suspended. It would be decidedly inconvenient if, at the end of a long sitting, after the Senate had been in committee for a long time, when there were few members present, a motion for the suspension of the standing orders were made. The more convenient practice is that now being pursued. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to suggest an amendment in order to bring the Bill into conformity with the lines which I suggested in my speech on the second reading. I intend to submit an amendment by way of suggestion for the omission of the words " Minister of External Affairs " in the first line of the schedule, and for the substitution of the word " Legislative " in their stead. Then I propose later on, should the committee agree to that, to insert after the items "The Senate," " the House of Representatives," " Parliamentary Debates," "the Parliamentary Library," "Refreshment Rooms," "Waterpower for Parliament House," and " Parliamentary Gardens," the words "Minister for External Affairs." We shall thus make a broad distinction between the rights and powers of the two Houses of Legislature and those of the Minister of External Affairs. I have a copy of the Estimates of Expenditure of New South Wales, and I find that it gives under the heading of " Executive and Legislative " the items " His Excellency the Governor, Executive Council, Legislative Council, Legislative Assembly, Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly, Parliamentary Library, Parliamentary Reporting Staff and Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works." Then comes the Chief Secretary's department, and the whole of the items relating to that department are given under it in the usual way. An absolute distinction is, therefore, made between the powers of the Legislature and the powers of the Ministry. While it is perfectly true that the Minister will have to send down the Estimates, it is, nevertheless, equally true that the Minister would very naturally throw the responsibility of the amounts submitted to Parliament upon the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives if there was a necessity for justifying the proposed expenditure. He would say that he had no desire to interfere at all with Parliament, and with the necessary provision that they might consider ought to be made to enable their debates to be carried out free from interference on the part of Ministers. I cannot conceive that Ministers would attempt to interfere with anything that might be done, or attempted to be done, by the two Houses with regard to their own particular affairs, but it is well to observe some rule with regard to these matters, and to have the clear distinction which I contend ought to exist between the legislative branch and the administrative or executive power of the Government. This proposal cannot interfere with the Government, but it recognises the control of each House over its own particular and special affairs. The Houses are not the creatures of the Government.

They allowed this Bill to come up here in its present form, and under the head of the Minister for External Affairs, we find placed the House of Representatives, the joint department of Parliamentary Debates, the Library, and all the joint departments of the two Houses, so that my honorable friend is not only taking us in hand, but he is also taking the other House in hand, and informing honorable members of the other House that the Legislature should not be in the position of being under any Minister responsible to Parliament. If we are so very sensitive about our rights, surely we must regard the rights of the other House, and though we may take up the position that we ought not to be placed under any Minister, do not let us take it upon ourselves to say to the other House, who have already assented to this position, that they are to be forced to take up another attitude by reason of what we do. Let me put another argument, which seems to me to bear very strongly upon this. In the passage of the last Supply Bill we had what; I think, all agree was a friendly thrashing -out of the procedure in regard to the rights of both Houses in reference to measures of this kind, and yet if honorable senators will look </para>

He has told us that we are not to make any suggestion unless in connexion with matters of vital concern in connexion with the Constitution.

                            <para>- In the other House - I do not remember at what stage - there is an Audit Bill which provides for the appointment of an auditor,- and probably for the appropriation of the salary. The auditor ought to be put in a position in which he is independent of Ministerial control. No doubt his salary will be fixed by statute, and therefore it will not appear in any Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- Practically, the attitude of the Government is that they intend to fix on a salary of £900 for the secretary, and we were led astray when we were "led to believe that it was only a temporary salary we were asked to approve. From remarks I heard in another place, and here, I understood that such was their intention. I think the salary is too high, and the department too overmanned. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the committee will not assent to the suggestion. It will be admitted that there must be some officer to discharge the duties of secretary. With separate military establishments in' the different States, we must have a central authority controlling them : a central department must administer all the different departments." I do not think any honorable senator will deny that that is an absolute essential of the position. I suppose it will be admitted that the first question is - Is this gentleman qualified to fill the position ? I am informed that Captain Collins is a man of very exceptional qualities for this position. He has occupied a similar position in regard to the forces of Victoria, and I understand that he has been one of the strongest instruments in cutting down military expenditure in that State. </para>

                            <para>- Ultimately against the Commonwealth, but in the arrangement of these transferred services it goes on the debit side of the accounts under the bookkeeping system. Would it have been a right or reasonable thing when we found a man who was eminently suited to the position, who had been doing the work of the office, to hand him over to the State of Victoria to find some employment for lim, or to take him into the federal service to discharge a duty which he was so well qualified to perform ? There can be no doubt that the only course open to the Government wishing to do tho right thing in the interests of the Commonwealth was to take over the officer. It is all very well to say that he should have been taken over at a salary of £750, or at what salary we chose to fix for the office. Although it may be open to doubt, still my opinion as a lawyer is that if these officers come over we are bound to retain them. They have certain rights, such as, I think, rights to pensions and retiring allowances, and several other privileges. But it seems to me there is nothing in the Constitution which binds the Commonwealth legally to continue to pay them the salaries which they happened to be paid at the time when they were taken over. In other words, I do not think that the Commonwealth guarantees them a continuance of the salaries which they had at the time of the transfer. But, at the same time, I think there is a strong moral obligation, if we do take over an officer on account of his special qualifications, not to put him in the position of being worse off financially than he was when doing the work of the State. And, after all, with every desire to be economical where economy really saves money, is it economical at all to make the experiment of getting in this position some new officer who may not be so well suited for it ? Or is it not better to retain Captain Collins and pay him the small additional amount which, it seems to me, is reasonably due to him? With regard to the salary for the office, it is probable that £750, which is the salary allotted to the heads of some other departments, will eventually be allotted to this particular office when it is filled by some one else. The difference between £750 and the £900 which is payable to this gentleman on account of the circumstances under which the Commonwealth takes him over, is not a great deal. It is one of those anomalies which must happen in changing from the old system to the new. They cannot be avoided without doing an injury to the Commonwealth itself. This case is nothing more than one of those . inconsistencies which will last only during the time that Captain Collins occupies the office ; and it' is an inconsistency through which the Commonwealth derives very considerable benefits through retaining this gentleman's service. That is the reason the salary is what it is, and it would be against the interests of the Commonwealth in every possible way, and false economy also, to reduce it. I hope the suggestion will not be accepted. </para>

                        <para>- I have every desire that salaries for the officers of the departments shall be on the most liberal and generous scale, but I am afraid the principle my honorable friend has laid down for the framing of these Estimates is a very dangerous one for us to adopt. It is not that we are to pay salaries that are to be fixed for the particular offices, but that we are to pay salaries in order to provide for officers of the States whom, under some unwritten understanding, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to take over. Now that, it seems to me, will cause very great inconvenience in the apportionment of these salaries. Either the salary ought to be considered with regard to the office which is to be filled, and fixed permanently, or for a time so far as we can foresee ; or there should be some new scheme introduced under which a selected number of officers, who may be specially adapted for the particular work upon which they are engaged, shall be taken over on special terms, so that it may be known in years to come, if this is not the basis upon which the Estimates are to be framed, that the present salary is entirely temporary and for a special purpose. f we say, on the one hand, that we are organizing a number of departments and that certain offices are to be filled, and that the officers are to be paid a certain amount, we know what we are doing ; but if, on the other hand, we are to provide for State officers who have been engaged in similar departments, the matter ought to be put upon that footing. But the position in which we shall.be put, it seems to me, is that, although it is understood that £750 is the ordinary routine or regular salary attachable to the position- </para>

The position is that we are told on the one hand that taking over Captain Collins means a saving to the State, while, so far as the figures on the Estimates are concerned, there is no saving to the State at all. The estimate for Victoria is £64,000, and under the heading of Commonwealth expenditure we have the salaries of the Secretary for Defence, the chief accountant, and several clerks. </para>

If the Government took one of the courses which they are entitled to take, and did not take over Captain Collins, the State of Victoria would have to provide for him either by giving him another position, with equal emoluments, or by giving him compensation on the abolition of his office. If we take him over and pay him th'is salary, Victoria is saved from having to provide for him. </para>

                        is to carry his proposal it should be put in a different form. The honorable senator wants to save the Commonwealth £900 a year. If that be his object he should move that the sum of £1,532 - the amount of the new expenditure for three months - be reduced by £225. Though I have not the pleasure of knowing Captain Collins, I am of opinion that the Secretary of the Defence department is worth £900 a year to the Government if he is worthy to fill the position. I do not believe in cheeseparing, and £900 is not too much for' the office. I shall support the Government.

                            <para>- If the honorable senator will spend a morning at the department he will be able to gain more information than I could tell him. I say we cannot do the work without a secretary, and that if we attempted to do so the loss to the Commonwealth would be very heavy indeed. I am speaking from a financial point of view. Then the next question is whether £900 per annum is too much for. the duties. I say again distinctly no. A man suited for the position is well worthy of that salary. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that if the proposal made by the honorable senator was carried out and tin's officer was not taken over, it would, in the long run, cost the Commonwealth more than if we adopted the proposal in the Bill. It is all very well to say that if he is not taken over the State will have to provide for him either a similar position or pension him off as one whose office has been abolished. I for one am not going to begin to separate the States from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth consists of the States, and the Commonwealth as a whole would have to pay this item, although it might fall heavier on one State than on another. In taking over Captain Collins we are taking over a man who has special knowledge, and at the present time it is all important that we should not have a new man. . We want some one at the head of the department who knows all the ropes, and who can assist the Minister in putting the whole of the machinery in working order. Then when the system is in working order, if it be deemed advisable to draw up a scheme - as it must be drawn up - that will be the time to deal with the salaries relating to the whole department. </para>

Thus, if any officers are no longer required in the State services, their salaries are not included in this sum of ?64,000, but their salaries are included in this Commonwealth department. I can hardly conceive it as probable that the Treasurer has allowed the salaries of these civil offices to be included not only in this Commonwealth estimate, but also in the lump sum of ?64,000. That is such an unbusinesslike transaction that I could not conceive him to be guilty of such a thing. </para>

                        <para>- - -At the beginning of an affair like this we have to place an immense trust in the Government. We are now passing a Supply Bill; when we come to the Appropriation Bill we will have an opportunity of getting the general as well as the particular view of the Government presented to us in a much more elaborate way. We are merely making an interim appropriation for the purpose of carrying on until in the ordinary course of events the Government bring down their formal proposals which will cover everything. Incidentally to that the department has to be carried on, .and we have to trust the Government absolutely, and to follow their lead unless there is some extremely good reason for departing from their suggestions. To do so binds us ultimately not a bit. We may reconsider the matter when the Appropriation Bill comes down, although undoubtedly by fixing even interim salaries we bind ourselves, to some extent, to favorably consider a subsequent appropriation permanently in the same direction. The officer we have under consideration at present is an officer of the Victorian department, universally approved of, as far as I can gather. I am personally acquainted with him, and no more. Of his merits I know nothing, except from the universal approbation that I hear his work has caused on the part of those who have seen him at his duties and know what he has done. The Ministry are satisfied. For the present I am satisfied, because they are the responsible persons, and they are using the best information they can obtain. They say he is the proper person to be put into the position which has undoubtedly to be established. Now we are simply on the question of salary, and we are discussing whether it should be £900 or- </para>

                            <para>- I thought the proposal was to reduce it. We are not in a position at present to consider for a moment a proposal to strike it out altogether. In fact, assuming that the office was necessary in the one State of Victoria, it ought to be much more necessary in the case of the Commonwealth. If £900 a year were even too large a salary to pay in Victoria, it does not follow at all that it would be too large to pay for the much more important work to be carried out for the Commonwealth. I have heard honorable senators ask what work this officer will have to do. </para>

                            <para>- This is. a matter which we can inquire into much better later on,, when we have the whole proposals before us, with all the information that can be given. At the present time we have only got the interim proposal to carry on the work until the Estimates proper can be brought down. When they are brought down we shall have everything before us, and it will be our duty to inquire into them, and not of necessity to stand to the views which we have expressed in this committee,, where we have of necessity very little information before us. We have to trust to Ministers who put forward these proposals. We have either to take the Ministerial proposals or reject them. We have to trust greatly to our confidence in the honorable and learned gentleman in charge, in carrying this interim Appropriation Bill, and later on to decide whether the appropriation shall become permanent or not. This seems to me to be a necessary office. It appears to me that the salary is not so excessive, and that it would be a mistake to interfere with the proposals of the Ministry, which are of necessity incomplete at the present time. </para>

                        (New South Wales). - While it is argued that this is only an interim Supply Bill to enable us to carry on, we must realize the fact that we are deliberately assenting to the appointment of a gentleman at a salary of £900 a year. Although it may be that when the Appropriation Bill comes up we can reduce this official's salary, I say it will be of very little use then to attempt a reduction when the salary has been paid in the meantime.

                            <para>- I was going to say that, and, moreover, having with our eyes open deliberately appointed a gentleman to be secretary of this department at a salary of £900, we cannot honorably retrace our steps when the Appropriation Bill comes up in three or six months time. Whether the salary proposed to be paid is a proper or an improper one, we have to realize the fact that the Government have told us straightforwardly that they have taken this gentleman over from the State of Victoria, and are going to give him the salary he has been getting from that State, whilst future appointees to the position are only to receive a salary of £750. Is it a fair thing to put it to us in this way, and then to say that we can in three or. six months deliberately 'cut down this gentleman's salary to £750 a year? </para>

I am not going to vote for the omission of the sum, because I know there must be a secretary to the department, and I am not prepared to say whether £900 is a reasonable sum to vote for the office or not. 1 am prepared to let the matter go at the present time, because I know that the gentleman occupying the position of military secretary will have important duties to perform, just as the other secretaries -will have to perform important duties. Whether he should receive more than the others is another question. I consider that he should receive, the same as the secretaries to the ordinary departments of the Government. </para>

I say he should not, and we should apportion the salary according to the work to be done, and not according to the person we are going to get for the office. These Estimates show a much larger expenditure than was incurred by the various States before federation. </para>

                            <para>.- Perhaps I do not comprehend the interruption, and it is well sometimes not to comprehend interruptions because it takes one off the track. If this great property is not kept under management ; if there is not a proper permanent head to see that the different officers in whose charge the articles lie are faithful in the discharge of their duties - their divisional duties, their corps duties, their regimental duties, and so forth - there will be a grea't loss to the public, and a very much greater annual loss than £.150, which I understand to be involved in the matter now before the committee. I am not arguing in favour of large salaries, but I desire simply to point out that the appointment of a secretary for defence is as absolutely needful as is a secretary for any division of the Government. The general officer commanding will have charge of the training and discipline of the forces, and he cannot be expected to keep the books any more than the general manager of a bank is expected to keep its ledgers. There is a proper officer for each department. As I have referred to banks I suppose I am justified in drawing a comparison. The general manager of a bank supervises financial operations. The secretary of the bank, who sometimes has as much power as the general manager, supervises a different part of the work and is as essential in that department as is the general manager in his. So it is with the military force. The Minister of Defence cannot do the work, and as the general commanding cannot do the work, who is to be the link ? There must be a connecting link between the heads of the regiments and the heads of the different divisions and the force, and in this case between the different military organizations in each of the States or military districts, which will all communicate to head-quarters in Melbourne, or wherever the department may be worked ; and there must be a connecting link to properly coach the Minister as to the details of the work which is going on around him and conduct the onerous correspondence, and manage the business aspect of the force - not the military aspect of the force, but the business or civil side. I have met Captain Collins, but I have no kind of knowledge of him. I am not speaking of him. </para>

                            <para>- If I were a general of an army, I should like to see that the weapons with which my men went into the field were of a fit and proper character, such as would enable them to' give a good account of themselves. I would not trust such a matter to the head of any civil branch. It should be one of the duties of the head of the military department to see to the rifles and all other weapons required by that department. In addition to the secretary, at £900 a year, we are to have a chief accountant, who, I suppose, will look after the payment of the forces. He is to receive £600. Then there is to be a chief clerk at £540, who, I suppose, will do the work of the secretary. Will the secretary have anything to do with the organizing of the department ? Will he organize new rifle clubs ? </para>

                            <para>- But that is the meaning of what the honorable senator said. Suppose some people are anxious to establish a rifle club in Rockhampton. A Rockhampton man would have to take the matter in hand, call people together, organize them, and get them to agree to join. After he had received a sufficient number of name she would write to the secretary in Melbourne, or wherever he might be located. The secretary would then, I suppose, send up a number of forms to be filled in, and all that sort of thing. He would merely do, or direct to be done, the clerical work in connexion with the formation of the rifle club. The people in the locality would have to do all the organizing. I was under the impression that this gentleman would go up and down the country- </para>

                            <para>-The motion is with regard to the salary of the Secretary of Defence, and it involves the discussion of the whole military department. In Queensland, the whole department could be discussed upon such an item. I do not profess to be a military expert. We have a number of military gentlemen on this side of the chamber. I do not know why the Government have not been able to enlist the services of any of our warriors, who, apparently are all sitting on the Opposition side. I am glad that we have had one of them addressing the committee, because he has thrown a little needed light upon the question. There is another aspect which I should like to suggest to honorable senators before I sit down. If you pay a certain salary to the secretary of one department, and pay lesser salaries to others, you will immediately establish in the minds of the others a spirit of discontent. If we pay the secretary of the Military department £900 per annum, and other secretaries £750, those others will be button-holing Members of Parliament and urge reasons why they should get an increase. </para>

                    <para>- It is really too strong in regard to the defendant to provide that the appearance shall be void, when it is remembered that the irregularity may be by inadvertence. If it is a fictitious address the whole case would be met by empowering a Judge to set it aside as irregular, but I think a defendant should, perhaps, be treated with more consideration where we are unable to judge whether an irregular appearance is sent in by inadvertence. We are only contemplating in this clause an appearance in person. If a solicitor is employed I think he ought to give the address. I submit for my honorable friend's consideration that we should provide that the appearance shall be either iri person or by solicitor. </para>

                    (Western Australia). *- Before saying definitely that I will accept the suggestion of
                    I shall just mention for the benefit of the legal members of the Chamber the reason why I proposed my amendment in this form.
                    prefers that we should leave subclause (2) in the Bill practically as it is, and he would accept my amendment as sub-clause
                    If a defendant receives a writ in person he looks at the back of it and sees that he must give an address which is within five miles of the place where the writ was issued, and that if. he does not give such an address the appearance will be no good at all, and it will also be irregular if he gives a fictitious or wrong address. His case requires to be studied because he may have made a mistake ; he may not correctly understand the indorsement, the indorsement may be misleading, or there may be no indorsement,- or he may give an address which will afterwards prove to be wrong because of the person having changed it. In any of these cases his appearance would be no good, and judgment would go against him by default. I wish by my amendment to secure the defendant in every way, and I provided two means. One was that he would receive warning that his appearance was wrong, before it became a legal document at all, because, when he would go to the office to enter it the clerk would have instructions not to receive it unless it contained the address ; and, therefore, if such an appearance could get on to the file contrary to the Act, it would get there by the wilful misconduct of the party himself.
                    amendment is that he may put the appearance on the file notwithstanding that it does not comply with the indorsement upon the writ, and notwithstanding that it is irregular. The clerk is to be obliged to receive it, but if the address he gives is illusory or fictitious, or wrong, then the other party, the plaintiff, before he can treat the appearance as no good, must apply to the Judge and state all the facts. That protects him in one way, but not as I wish to protect him, because I would provide that it should not be possible for him  to put uri irregular appearance upon the file at all.

                        <para>- It is more merciful because it gives two chances. I think it is desirable to make such provision, having regard to the fact that this Act will be operative all over Australia, that thousands of miles may intervene between the plaintiff and the defendant, and that ignorant defendants may be served with writs. I think it is therefore only fair to provide first of all that the defendant shall not be allowed to put his appearance upon tho file at all unless it contains the things necessary under the Act. </para>

                        <para>- That is the practice in England, and where we are dealing; with a superior court, and with the officials, connected with a superior court, it is quite right to make them the judges of whether an appearance shall be received or not. But. we are dealing with the officers of all kinds, of courts here - any court which may be called a Court of Record, or even a court, which is not in law called a Court of! Record. Therefore the officials who may receive the summons are not always persons, qualified to judge, whether the provisions of: the Statute have been complied with. At the same time I quite see that it may be a, little bit hard to make the appearance altogether void if the address is not given. So if the address is, not given, or if the address is fictitious, I propose to give the parties the right to go before a Judge, and have the appearance set aside as irregular. </para>

If If the alleged offence is committed, say in Kalgoorlie, and the offender leaves that place and goes to Charters Towers before a summons is issued, can he be brought back from Charters Towers to Kalgoorlie ; or if he does not go back; or has not the means, or for some other reason is not able to go back, can the case be tried in his absence? Can he be found guilty and sentence be pronounced against him ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is necessary to insert those words, because it is entirely optional with the judge or justice whether he issues the warrant or not. The clause says that he " may " issue ; and it is entirely in his hands to do so or not, as he thinks fit. He has already given leave to serve the summons, and has an absolute discretion as to whether he will issue the warrant or not. The amendment I move is intended to make it clear that it is a condition that it must be proved that a reasonable sum was tendered to the witness for expenses before the Judge can exercise his jurisdiction at all. That is only reasonable. If you want to bring a 'man from one part of Australia to another part, the Judge should be satisfied that you have tendered him reasonable expenses. </para>

                <para>That makes a very great difference. The clause, as it stood, provided that where a warrant was issued proper proof of it was given before a justice of the peace in any other part of the Commonwealth, the defendant might be arrested, and then and there brought back to the State out of which the warrant was issued, and there dealt with. That might involve a very great hardship. A warrant might be issued in New South Wales and taken over to Western Australia, and a person arrested on it there. Instead of being dealt with before a magistrate there in the first instance, he could be brought right back to New South Wales. It seems to me that would be rather a stringent method of dealing with such matters, and I have adopted more the procedure provided in the Fugitive Offenders' Apprehension Act, which is in force in all the States. The process that I propose to provide is that where a person is apprehended in any State under a warrant issued in another State, that he shall be brought before a justice in the State in which he is apprehended ; that that justice shall have power to inquire into the matter, and if he finds that it is a proper case for a remand, that he shall remand him to the State in which the warrant was issued. </para>

                        <para>- He will get it by some amendments that I am going to move. Under my proposal a warrant is issued, and it is executed in a State other than the State in which it was issued. The person is arrested, brought before a justice in the State in which he is arrested, and then the justice is to have the powers set forth in the amendments which I am about to propose. These amendments enable the person arrested to go before the magistrate at the place where he is arrested, and if the case is really one in which in all fairness the person ought not to be sent under arrest to the other end of Australia, the magistrate may either admit him to bail or discharge him altogether, or, if he thinks fit, send him on. </para>

                    if this power to make regulations could be used to effect what I have already mentioned, and secure the entering and registration of the satisfaction of judgments.
