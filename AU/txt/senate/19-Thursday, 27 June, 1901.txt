                    <para>I have taken this action solely as the representative of the Government in the Senate, charged, as it seems to me,with the duty of seeing that petitions which are brought before this House claiming the redress of any grievance, shall be before the Senate in such form that they will have consideration. I know nothing whatever about the facts of the petition or as to its merits. I express no opinion about it. I am simply taking this action formally, in order that the petition may be brought before the Senate. It appears by a certificate indorsed' upon it that the. petition was delivered to the Clerk on the 23rd May, 1901, and that £50 was lodged with him as security for costs. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question, without notice. Some few weeks ago, in answer to a question by me, he indicated his willingness to lay upon the table of the Senate a copy of the agreement about to be entered into for the use of these buildings. He indicated that he would do so as soon as a copy was available) and as I have waited for about three weeks, perhaps the honorable and learned gentleman will tell the Senate whether a copy is yet available? </para>

                    <para>- I hope that honorable senators will give fair consideration to this clause, and particularly to these two words. Every one knows that so far as the word " offensive " is concerned, it would be very hard to define its meaning. What might be offensive to one individual might be the contrary to some one else. Therefore, seeing that the Deputy Postmasters-General, as well as the Postmaster-General himself, have the power to deal with anything in the shape of a post-card or any other document that may be supposed to be offensive by one individual and not by another and to destroy without further investigation, we should be careful not to make the power too wide. As far as the term " libel " is concerned, it often takes a bench of Judges with a jury of twelve, and a dozen gentlemen of the legal profession, to decide what is a libel, and then they do not always reach a definite conclusion. To give any Deputy Postmaster-General power to define what is libellous without inquiry is carrying legislation to an absurdity. I have as much respect for the feelings of individuals as any one, but I do not think that we should place a provision in an Act of Parliament that would make our conduct look absurd in the eyes of the people. If there is any necessity for such legislation, it should be effected in some other way. Many Acts of Parliament may have to be passed respecting the carrying of letters and other documents in which offensive caricatures and prints- of that description can be dealt with. They ought to be dealt with, but such a provision is out of place in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so ; but if a post-card contains anything offensive or libellous it should be stopped at once. The mere fact of such matter being put upon a post-card shows that the sender desires to hold the intended recipient up to ridicule. The difference in cost between a letter and post-card is so small that the fact of a postcard being used for the purpose of insulting a person indicates that the intention was to allow other persons to see the libel. The postal authorities should have power to stop such a communication at once. A libellous post-card has to go through the hands of numerous postal officials, as well as, perhaps, into the hands of a man's servants, and the members of his household. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out that we shall soon have to consider a later 'clause, which gives the same power not to the Postmaster-General, nor even to so high an official as a Deputy Postmaster-General, but to any telegraph officer who receives a telegram. Any such officer has had hitherto and will have power to' refuse to accept and send a telegram if it contains " blasphemous, indecent, profane, or offensive " matter. The reason being that underlying this power. We ought to refuse to allow a scandalous post-card or telegram to pass through the hands of different postal officials and other persons until it readies its destination. Though the word "offensive" is a very vague one, and gives great scope to the person who has to decide upon its application, still the object has to be seriously looked at before the word is rejected. </para>

                    <para>- As this debate proceeds, I gather the impression, from what the Postmaster-General and other senators have said, that each post-card that goes through the post-office is subject to the scrutiny of every officer through whose hands it passes. I was always under the impression that post-office employees troubled themselves only with the addresses on postcards. Does the Minister now mean to tell us that a post-office employee, if he sees that a post-card is addressed in a particular way, turns it upside down and reads it through to find out whether there is any offensive matter in it? If so, that destroys the secret character of the post-office. </para>

                        <para>- We should not recognise the possibility at all. A post office employee has nothing to do with any portion of any communication that goes through the post-office except the address. I have sent written matter on post-cards that I should not care to divulge to any person except the addressee, in the belief that what I was writing was secret, and could not come to the knowledge of any individual except the person to whom it was addressed. The assertion now made destroys this confidence. If the statement the Postmaster-General has made goes forth, the result will be that the post-card as a medium of communication between individuals will become obsolete. </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General has argued excellently for the exclusion of sub-clause (4) of clause 27. I think other senators, as well as myself, pointed out, when that clause was going through, that the right of appeal there given was of very little value, inasmuch as it was an appeal that was only granted to an individual who felt aggrieved by the destruction of postal matter in connexion with which he had some proprietary right. </para>

If he is given an appeal in that instance, I say we should equally extend to him an appeal for redress under this clause. If there is any reason at all for such an appeal under clause 27, where the power is simply vested in the Postmaster-General, there is seven times as much reason for inserting such a provision in clause 41, where the power is- vested not only in the Postmaster-General, but in every one of his deputies. </para>

                        <para>- There is a difference between the two cases. When we were considering clause 27 a suggestion was made to amend the clause, by providing that a newspaper should not be destroyed until after such an interval as would enable the sender of it, or any person who felt aggrieved by its detention to appeal. I pointed out then that there was not the least likelihood of the discretionary power given in the clause being exercised in such a way as to prevent any aggrieved person having the right of appeal. The committee considered that a sufficient explanation, and would not amend the clause. Under clause 27, power is given to stop a newspaper containing, for example, an objectionable advertisement. In the exercise of that power the whole issue of that newspaper would be stopped, and succeeding issues would be stopped if they contained the same advertisement. The right of appeal is given,' however, and if the aggrieved person succeeded in his case, the newspaper would pass through the post in future, and all the copies that had been stopped would be delivered to their addresses. There is no analogy between these two cases. We are dealing now with a communication of such an objectionable character that the Postmaster-General, or any Deputy Postmaster-General is ordered to destroy it forthwith. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the Postmaster-General should have said that, because I have been reading the clause, and I have noticed that although it purports to deal with objectionable matter on the outside only, it also deals with enclosures. However, it cannot do very much harm. Provisions of this kind exist in many Acts of Parliament. They are assertions of authority by local officers who want perhaps to have the biggest powers in their own hands, but they generally administer them very well, and not much damage is done. When we are solemnly enacting a measure, as we are now, however, the question is, whether we ought not to be a little cautious.. It appears to me that to give under clause 41 the power to open letters, and to judge offhand whether t-hey are obscene or not, and to say there is no possible appeal for damages, is distinctly inconsistent with clause 27, which recognises that in the course of his duty the Postmaster-General may make mistakes, and that there should be a remedy for the person aggrieved. </para>

It is particularly aimed at articles other than those dealt with in. clause 27. </para>

That is to say, you have . no right to recover, in a court of law, anything that would recompense you £ or the injury done, but if you are aggrieved otherwise than as to the wrong done to you, you can go to a Justice of the High Court, and have that grievance removed. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to explain what is the value of the appeal to the Justice of the High Court. I contend that the Bill says no wrong is done to me by the destruction of this document, but I may go in a court and say, while I cannot complain of that document being destroyed, I am aggrieved, inasmuch as its destruction implies that I cannot post another of a similar kind. I think it is a perfectly comprehensible position. </para>

                        <para>- That will make them all the more careful not to do any harm to any single individual. If they do, Parliament is perfectly ready at all times to redress grievances, and to bring Postmasters General, or Premiers, or other high officials to book for wrongs that they have done. It is not reasonable to allow an appeal in regard to blasphemous, profane, and indecent matter. The literature of some foreign countries, such as France, is demoralizing. </para>

                        <para>- We are wasting a long time over the clause. If an appeal is to be given, it is quite impossible to limit it to any particular class of offence. I am willing to put in an appeal clause similar to that contained in clause 27, but first of all it will be necessary to omit the word "forthwith." It would be no use to give the right of appeal if the subject-matter, which would be the principal evidence, had been destroyed. I think the Postmaster-General or his deputy must have the discretion of retaining the matter pending appeal. </para>

                    <para>- There seems to be no apparent analogy between the provisions of clause 27 and clause 41. I think we ought to pause before we add the amendment, and I hope the Minister will not move the amendment which he indicated. 1 gather that the Minister provides that there shall be an appeal to a Judge of the High Court by any person aggrieved. That would be perfectly applicable to the provisions of clause 27, but wholly inapplicable to the injury done under clause 41. Clause 41 simply confers an arbitrary power upon the Postmaster-General or his deputy to absolutely destroy an article. The Seed is done. He has sat in judgment. He has pronounced sentence, and executed it. Then what good is the appeal to be ? If you provided at the end of the clause that no party aggrieved should be deprived of the remedy to sue for damages for any injury which he has sustained, there would be some redress, but a mere appeal would be nothing. It would be an appeal against a conclusion at which the Postmaster-General had arrived in finding that there was offensive matter - on a postal article, and had ordered it to be destroyed. That would bring no redress, and would be of no earthly good to the person who posted the article or to the. person to "whom it was addressed. </para>

                        <para>- I want to point out the difference between the two clauses. Clause 27 provides for a totally different set of circumstances, to which an appeal is absolutely inapplicable. It does not provide for the destruction of these things, but the Postmaster-General or his deputy may refuse to transmit or deliver them. But the posting of these articles may go on. The provision of sub-clause (4) gives an opportunity to the person aggrieved to have it settled whether there is anything seditious, blasphemous, or libellous in the matter posted. If the High Court decides that the retention of these newspapers was erroneous, they may continue to be posted. </para>

                    <para>- I think we . should eliminate this clause from the Bill. It appears to have been in the South Australian Postal Act, but it is open to the objection that I urged against clause 54 when I was speaking upon the motion for the second reading. The matter provided for in the clause really does not arise in the conduct of postal business. The effect of the clause is, I think - as will be apparent to every one - that the moment a person becomes insolvent or bankrupt it is open to his creditors by an application to the court to convert the post-office officials into spies of his correspondence. The object clearly is to prevent the making away of assets that frequently follows upon bankruptcies. I am in entire sympathy with those who would put a stop to the pernicious habit among traders of becoming bankrupt in order to wipe out existing debts. </para>

                        <para>- Or private individuals, but traders mainly. Many bankrupts make arrangements at the time they become insolvent that the money they have shall be secured to their wife or to some friends. But while I am in favour of the object of the clause, I am very much opposed to its method. Whenever such a case has arisen in courts of law I have never hesitated to object to the administration of justice being carried out by a system of espionage. It seems to me a shocking thing that because a man has become bankrupt it is to be open to third parties to obtain control of communications passing between him and his wife or his friends, to open- those Communications, and to eavesdrop, so to speak, in order that they may come to the court and show that something he has sworn in an affidavit or some statement in the evidence which he has given verbally is untrue. Thereby they not only make him fail in his attempt to obtain his discharge, but may punish him for perjury. This is a grossly underhand and subtle method of getting at a person who may be disposed to do wrong. After all, the post-office is only an institution whereby the thoughts of persons may be exchanged at a distance. </para>

                        <para>- It may be ; but let. us view it in its true character, and then let us see whether we as a Legislature are going to lend ourselves to being paid detectives. I was about to say, when I was met with interjections, that the real object of postal business, is to convey thoughts from one individual to another: Suppose we narrow the space, and put the insolvent in his private room with his wife or with some friends. What would honorable senators think of a Bill which said to the household servants - " Once you see it published in the newspapers that your master is insolvent, you are at liberty to put your ear to the keyhole and tell us what is between him and his friends." If it were put in that clear bold form in a Bill, our sense of what was decent and manly would revolt against it. This provision is as if you assisted a person to either put his ear to the keyhole or to look in through a skylight upon the bankrupt in order to find out what was passing confidentially between him and his friends. There are provisions in many Bankruptcy Acts that a person may be treated as an insolvent although there has been no proclamation given to the fact at all, nor such a thing as a public notice. The effect of this clause would be that once a man was put in that position, if a letter were written by him giving directions as to dealing with his property, that letter, unknown to him, might come into the hands of the official receiver, and be read by him, and when the unfortunate man was under examination he would be subject to a star chamber method of inquiry which is contrary to the principles of fair play that prevail in all our courts of justice. </para>

                        <para>- I may say that it is not a fact. When we say that the official assignee stands in the place of a bankrupt, we do not mean that he is the 1ankrupt. All that we mean is that, for the purpose of giving effect to the disposition of the bankrupt's affairs, the official is regarded as the bankrupt. We have never carried the representative character of the official assignee into the private personal surroundings of ' the bankrupt, and so long as we confine the duties of the official assignee to gathering in the assets I am content to allow him to stand entirely for the bankrupt when once he is clothed with authority. Although theoretically the official receiver has not the authority, yet as a matter of fact he has: If he applies to a Judge and says - " I would wish the communications passing to a bankrupt to be stopped," I can see no reason why the Judge should refuse. </para>

                        <para>- They often do refuse in South Australia because the Judges themselves have rebelled against such a clause. I object to the clause simply in the spirit of what I think is fair play and manly usage. If a man becomes insolvent, and we are going to investigate his affairs, let us do it in an open spirit, do not let us take advantage of the fact that we know he has communications in the hands of a carrier, and then go to that carrier and say, "Open those communications in order that we may find out what is in them." It struck me as unfair and unworthy and underhand, but if the Senate is satisfied that this means is necessary to detect persons who are trying to do away with their property, 1 will not press my objection, because, as far as expediency is concerned, I think the clause is very useful. The expediency of -it must commend itself to every one. </para>

                    <para>- The Chamber of Commerce in Sydney have asked me to draw attention to this clause. They think it unreasonable that the relatives of deceased persons pending the issue of probate or letters of administration should have to wait for correspondence in possession of the Postal department. In many cases if a person cannot get a letter except after a delay of months it may mean a serious inconvenience. My brother at home may send out a letter to me directing me to do certain things on his behalf. It may be some time before probate or letters of administration are taken out in the case, and owing to this clause that letter could not be opened. Could not some means be suggested by which the postal authorities could have permission to open the letters in the presence of the nearest relatives of the deceased ? Not being a legal man, I do not see my way to draft an amendment, but there is undoubtedly a grievance. </para>

                    <para>- Of course there is every desire to deliver letters as quickly as possible to the persons entitled to receive them, and this clause is framed with that object. I do not see how it could be enlarged in any way without throwing an unfair responsibility on the Postal department. The honorable senator will see that it . would involve the department in very great responsibility if it undertook to deliver letters to any particular relative. They might be delivered to certain relatives soon after intimation of death, and afterwards some other' relative might obtain probate or letters of administration, and the department might be proved to have done wrong in handing those letters. over. The provision of the clause is very clear. As soon as probate or letters of administration have been taken out, the executor or administrator receives the letters. In case there is no legal representative, there is power taken for the Postmaster-General or his deputy to open the letters in the presence of any near relative, and deliver to him. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to adding a few remarks to what I have already said with regard to this clause. It is a ' power that is given to the Postmaster-General in nearly every Postal Act - a power under certain circumstances to refuse to deliver letters. I should like to say, repeating what I said on the second reading, that the Postmaster-General, as Postmaster-General, lias the duty cast upon him of delivering letters and other postal articles, and it is primarily his business to receive and deliver them. In that respect he is in the position of a carrier of postal articles, but the Legislature always lays down the general rules upon which he shall act. It states the limitations and restrictions and exceptions, and generally, I think it is what I may call the moral sense of the community that dictates to him the conditions under which ho shall do his work. The Postmaster-General himself is never very anxious for restrictions of this kind, but they are restrictions put upon him by law, and he has to carry out the law. We have to consider under this Bill what are the conditions under which this work of receiving and delivering postal articles shall be carried out. This particular clause says that, under certain circumstances, letters of a particular character shall not be delivered. That is a power that is 'given to the Postmaster-General in almost every civilized community, where there is a post-office, and I cannot admit for one moment that the </para>

                        <para>- I will enlarge on that by-and-by, because I think it has had some effect, but I have no doubt that the reason why such a large amount of business is done by Tattersall is on account of that form of gambling having been suppressed in the other five States. The amount of revenue which is being derived in Tasmania is the direct result of the other States refusing to allow that kind of consultation to be established within their confines. If the law were uniform throughout the Common wealth then Tattersall might be reestablished in all the other States. The amount of revenue which Tasmania would derive in that event from that particular form of gambling would be very small indeed. Therefore, all the trouble is due to the fact that Tasmania has been receiving a large amount of financial benefit in consequence of this particular form of gambling having been suppressed in the other States. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that now. From a financial point of view Tasmania would have very little cause of complaint if this particular form of gambling were re-established in all the States, because in that event her financial interest would be very small! ' It will thus be seen that Tasmania's complaint from that point of view is not so much that letters should be delivered in Tasmania as that letters should not be delivered in the other States. A plea is made in this petition for the sacred right of privacy of correspondence. I stand open to correction, but I believe that in Tasmania the same right to refuse to deliver letters has been exercised. In fact, I think it is not long since there was a refusal in that State to deliver letters to a business very similar to Tattersall's, but which was not sanctioned by law. </para>

                        <para>- Unfortunately, I have not those regulations. I am aware that Tattersall is established in Tasmania by authority of a section of the Gambling Act, which provides that if a person complies with certain conditions laid down in the regulations he may be allowed to carry on that business. I am not aware what these regulations are, but I have been informed that only recently there was a refusal to deliver letters to another establishment in Tasmania which attempted to carry on the business of raising sweeps or consultations without having complied with the law. The point I wish to make clear at the present time is that the amount of revenue Tasmania has derived, and the reason why this question is so acute in that State, is on account of the operations of Tattersall having been stopped in the other States. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. If the same law applied all the way round - if Tattersall were sanctioned in the other States- then the revenue derived by Tasmania from that source would shrink to one-twentieth of what it is. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster- 'General has nothing to do with that. If- we admit that Parliament has the right to say that the Postmaster-General shall not deliver certain letters, then Parliament has a right to say what letters he shall deliver. The Postmaster-General is not asking for the power to refuse to deliver letters. He is simply the servant of the public and Parliament lays down for him exactly the rules that he shall follow. He must do his duty according to the Act of Parliament under which he is carrying on his operations. It is perfectly clear to me, seeing that the Constitution gives us power to make laws to carry on the postal service, that Parliament is competent to prescribe the exact manner in which the work of the Post and Telegraph Office shall be carried on. </para>

                        <para>- Absolutely, I think. The Constitution clearly gives the power to make laws with regard to the postal service. The only restriction is that it says no undue preference shall be given by any law to one State as against another. Therefore it is clear to me that if the Postal Act states that under certain circumstances a letter shall not be delivered to a certain person, that provision applies equally throughout the Commonwealth. There can be no distinction between one State and another. If the law says that a letter must be delivered to the addressee that must apply equally to every part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It could be altered, and that makes stronger my case that it is for Parliament to say what letters shall or shall, not be delivered. There must be some cases in which the Postmaster-General, must be ordered not to deliver. That being so, it is for Parliament to decide what class of letters should be subject to such embargo : and whatever Parliament decides the post-office will give effect to the law. I am asked if paragraph (6) safeguards art union lotteries. I am not sure whether it does or does not, except that I think the words "not sanctioned by law" were inserted in the Queensland Act to provide for the case of art union lotteries and trade union lotteries which were sanctioned by law. </para>

                        <para>- -Yes. I should have no objection to facing the whole question of gambling and lotteries, but I maintain that we should face it by direct legislation. It is just because, as I think, we cannot legislate directly with regard to gambling and lotteries that I make a most earnest appeal to honorable senators even though they have the greatest moral repulsion to gambling and lotteries to consider whether they are justified, however pure their motives may be, in adopting a. method that is certainly not direct. I admit the purity of the motives of honorable senators who wish to suppress gambling, but, though they are proud of the purity of their motives, they should be very careful about their methods. If those methods are not straightforward, but merely such as would be adopted by a man who wants to score a point off another man by taking him at a. disadvantage, they should not be adopted. When indulging in social legislation of this; character we should be extremely careful to* see that our methods are not unworthy, in spite of the purity of our motives. That is my objection to this clause. We are not attempting by direct means to stop Tattersall's from carrying on. It is recognised that we cannot do that. But we are attempting to hamper and hinder the lotteries. There is no force whatever in the argument that if we cannot succeed entirely in the accomplishment of an object, we should do our best by moving in that direction as far as we possibly can. That is a weak and objectionable argument. We must consider in serious legislation the chance of legislating effectively ; and no one in this Senate should be ready to adopt a hasty, slipshod form of legislation because of a conviction that it will partly succeed in attaining the object in view. Legislation of that sort is bad. If we cannot comprehensively cover the whole field, we ought to hesitate before we take the action that is now proposed, even from the stand-point of those who wish to stop gambling. The position of the Federal Parliament with regard to the sweeps in question is exactly the same as it would be if the lottery were carried on directly and entirely by the State of Tasmania as a State affair. The position is just as strong at the present moment as if Tattersall's were conducted entirely by the State. </para>

                        <para>- We cannot shut our eyes to the facts of the case. We are now legislating in a serious way, and if the honorable senator who interjects does not know the facts I will tell him ; and I hope he will afford me a measure of belief when I explain the state of the case. If the position of things were that the State of Tasmania were conducting these lotteries, and the same doubt existed with regard to the powers of the Federal Parliament, we should hesitate before attempting by legislation of this indirect nature to seriously interfere with the operations of a State forming part of the Commonwealth. I say that the position here is just as strong when the lottery is being carried on by a man called Adams,' in Tasmania, under Tasmanian legislation, as if Tasmania were conducting the business. It is advisable, therefore, to point out that we are dealing with a lottery that is conducted in a State under those conditions. Tasmania has not failed to legislate with regard to gambling. That State has directly considered the question of gambling, and has legislated upon it. If Tasmania had ignored all legislation with regard to gambling there might be some strength in the opinion of those senators who want to interfere in that State. But the position is made stronger by the fact that the State has legislated with regard to gambling. I say frankly that if I had been a member of the State Legislative Assembly of Tasmania, I would have opposed the legislation with regard to gambling there. While saying that I am perfectly consistent in the position I now take up in the Senate - that we ought not to interfere with the -right of Tasmania to permit these sweeps - I do not ask a.ny senator to pay any regard to the financial aspect of the question so far as it affects Tasmania. I say at once that if I cannot succeed in making the Senate adopt my view with regard to this clause on logical and constitutional grounds, I shall refuse-" to put forward the unworthy plea that we should do so on financial grounds. Those grounds are too low for me to adopt, and I refuse to accept them ; but I am so anxious that this clause shall be amended that if that argument has any weight with any senators - it would not have much with me - I would simply point to the fact that it would mean a loss of revenue of from £15,000 to £30,000 a year to Tasmania. The only part of the argument that has weight with me is this - that when the' States of Australia federated, and the control of post and telegraphs was handed over to the Commonwealth, as a whole, all' those States had a right to expect that the post and telegraph services would be administered for their benefit if possible. That is the financial aspect of this case so far as it affects Tasmania. If the Federal Parliament decides -to stop the lotteries, Tasmania will lose by her willing and ready adherence to the inclusion of post and telegraph services amongst the thirty-nine other subjects committed to the Commonwealth, about £20,000 a year. But I am making no plea for pity on the part of Tasmania. If the Parliament chooses to legislate and impose that financial burden, Tasmania will have to bear it. My chief contention is that the clause concerns a matter about which it is doubtful whether under the Constitution we have any right to legislate, We must have the very gravest doubts as to our .constitutional position in this particular. I am .prepared to hear before the debate is finished a considerable number of precedents quoted. I am not prepared here to give many, but I would remind the Senate of- something which they probably know. Our Constitution .lias been based rather upon the American than upon the Canadian Constitution, and -senators know that under the American Constitution the individual States have reserved to themselves the entire right of -legislation with regard to subjects like .marriage and divorce. I ask every senator .who is honest in the desire to put- down gambling whether social legislation affecting marriage and divorce is not at least as important as social legislation affecting gambling and lotteries. </para>

                    <para>- I entirely agree with the remarks of the last speaker. I am not going to repeat the arguments which I put before the Senate when the second reading of the Bill was under discussion ; but I wish to answer many of the statements which have been made, when the question has been privately discussed since, to justify the retention of the clause in the Bill. I am of opinion that the clause is entirely inconsistent with the declaration of the Postmaster-General, that he intended to confine the operations of the post-office to postal business. I arn certainly very puzzled to see how this matter arises however remotely or incidentally in the carrying on of postal services regarded as such. The Postmaster-General in his speech to-day took up an interjection of mine, and said that once I admit that his officers could exercise a discretion in not lending the post-office to the conveyance of immoral or obscene matter, I am bound to admit that he must regard that which has been put down as unlawful by the States as being in the same category. Now it seems to me that there is a clear distinction between things that are made unlawful by Act of Parliament and things that are crimes or that are objected to by the sense of all humanity. The Postmaster-General, the same as any other carrier, is exonerated by the common law, if there never existed a statute, from making himself, or those whom he employs, vehicles for conveying insulting or offensive language, or being in any way participants in a crime. But no law ever said that a carrier is to exercise his own discretion as to what is inexpedient and to say - " Because this thing is inexpedient I will not lend my services in any way in connexion with it." Lotteries are not morally wrong. They have never been proved to be morally wrong. </para>

                        <para>- Lotteries have never been held to be morally wrong. So far back as the statute of William III., when they were first dealt with in England, we find that the legislation against them was not enacted because they were morally wrong, but because undue advantage was being taken of certain patents and charters granted to certain individuals for carrying on this business. </para>

                        <para>- Now, what I was attempting to do was to point out that it does not become part of the postal business to interfere in this matter simply because it is considered right not to lend the services of the department ' to an immoral purpose. Nobody will contend that there is anything immoral in my putting 5s. or 10s. into a third person's hands and saying, "You hold that as a stake abiding a certain event." The character of the act is. not altered because a thousand persons do the same thing, and yet .those thousand persons doing the same thing in a certain way make it a lottery. I am not now going so far as to say that lotteries are good in their consequences. I believe that they very often lead to bad results; but what I am saying is this : that lotteries are made unlawful in some States not because of their inherent vice, not because they involve moral turpitude in the persons who take part in them, but because in their consequences they are found to be bad for a particular State. They therefore are condemned not at all by reason of anything that makes them repugnant to men's sense of morality, but merely because they are admitted in certain States to be repugnant to the good of those States. Now, I maintain that the Federation distinctly and by the clearest expression reserved to each State tha*-. joined in the union the right of making by its own motion, unaffected by the Commonwealth, its social laws. Five of the States apparently have come to the conclusion that lotteries are bad. One of them has come to the conclusion that they are good. Now we, whose voice ought .not to be heard at all on this question of lotteries, take advantage of the carrying power passing through our hands, to graft upon our statute-book a law that it shall be in the discretion of the Postmaster-General to say whether lotteries shall be conducted or not. Although this clause does not repeal the Lottery Act in Tasmania directly, it does indirectly, because if it were passed lotteries could no longer be carried on there. </para>

                        <para>- It may be my unfortunate Irish voice that suggests insincerity. I think, sir, that this is not unsound reasoning, and I will make it clear. Supposing the States had authority to exercise functions A, B, C, and D, there would " be nothing to prevent them, in a Bill relating to A, embodying legislation relative, to B, C, and D. But if these States say - " For the purposes of our federal bond we will delegate to a central authority function A," is it open to that central authority then to say - " It is incidental to the carrying out of function A that we should include functions B, C, and D, because they have been linked to A in the States ?" They were only so linked in the States, however, because an independent and direct power existed there to deal with them. I think that is clear. Can it be said that because we have complete control of the carrying of business letters and articles through the post that we are entitled to take advantage of that control to give effect to ideas of ours on matters that we have no direct constitutional right to deal with? I take an illustration : We in this Commonwealth may say that we do not believe in card playing ; we may say that we do not believe in share dealing ; but I do not think any one will deny that, whatever may be our opinions on these matters, we have no jurisdiction officially to give effect to them. It is for the States to say whether they shall continue card playing or illegalize share dealing. Will any one contend then that under this Constitution we would be within our rights in embodying in the Postal Bill a clause which authorized the Postmaster-General to stop any pack of cards that passed through the post, or which authorized the Postmaster-General tq destroy any .of these bought and sold share notes ? </para>

I do not think the argument is at all far-fetched. A man in Western Australia, for instance, where these lotteries have been allowed, and where halfcrown and five-shilling sweeps have been frequent - I know of hundreds of cases, and have been one of . the delinquents, myself - walks along the street with 5s. in his pocket. He perhaps meets a friend, and is inclined to say, " Come to the club and have a drink." But if there is a 5s. sweep into which he can put the money, he probably says to himself, " I will put the 5s. into Tattersall's." By doing that the man - is better in health, he is no worse in pocket, and I venture to say that in the long run the community as a whole is benefited. </para>

                        <para>- Sometimes. I seriously press upon the Senate that they should put out of mind as unworthy of the' slightest consideration 'That these lotteries are socially, politically, or morally inexpedient. Let us simply consider the point : Are we not unjustified in indirectly trying to put a stop to these lotteries when, under the very federal bond by right of which we speak in this Chamber, we say to the States, " You keep in your hands the regulation of all those matters that you have not specifically given to the Federal Parliament?" We should not set up the position that one State - in this case poor Tasmania - has to say to us, " I have consented to allow the" Commonwealth Government to carry my mails, but I never did consent to allow the Government to exercise a control as to whether I should carry on sweeps or not." Is it fair to Tasmania to do that ? If it is unfair to her to-day a similar action may prove equally unfair to another State tomorrow. What is to prevent us in Western </para>

                    <para>- I should like to say a few words upon this clause 54. The whole position appears to me to lie within a very small compass. The question is whether what we are undertaking to 'do is a constitutional act or the reverse. As I read the Constitution we have no power to legislate directly on such a subject as gambling. That being so, I do not see how by indirect means we can under the broadest interpretation of the Constitution, and with a desire to do what is right, try to effect indirectly that which we cannot constitutionally effect directly. That is the crux of the whole question. If the Government can show us, or show to me, that Parliament is legally and constitutionally able to legislate directly in that way I shall be satisfied to allow the clause to stand as it is. </para>

                        <para>.- I should like to look at the matter according to the broadest interpretation that can be put on the Constitution- Act. I do not wish in any way to confine the rights and powers of this Senate, but 1 hold that we require to see that in applying ourselves to their maintenance we do not injure the lights and privileges of the States who placed us in the position we now occupy. A great deal has teen said about the moral aspect of the case. I do not wish to raise that question at the present moment. The moral aspect is a matter entirely for legislation of a direct character when it is clearly demonstrated that we have power to legislate in the direction desired. I would ask honorable senators and those from whom petitions have been received - the council of churches and other bodies representing the moral force and the good feeling of the country - to hesitate before they allow themselves to be made vehicles for stultifying to a great extent the terms of our union. The originators of these petitions are acting in all good faith. They should not, however, be led to believe that we have the power to legislate in this direction. I would ask honorable senators to hesitate before lending themselves to do an act which I will not call underhand, but which does by indirect means that which we have no power to carry out directly. I appeal to the Senate to give this matter consideration apart from its moral aspect. Its constitutional aspect deserves the very greatest consideration. </para>

It also hands over to them a moral control. It gives them absolute and unlimited control. They can say it is not for the peace, order, and good government of a community that we should carry this, that, or the other, and they can refuse to take anything they please. They have unlimited jurisdiction with regard to the postal and telegraphic business of the Commonwealth. That jurisdiction is absolutely within the ambit of the authority conferred upon them by the States. </para>

                        <para>- We have the right to pass this clause, but whether we should exercise that right is a matter which ought to be most thoughtfully considered with reference to the moral, financial, and social condition of every State which we are seeking to affect. We have no right to thrust upon a free State laws repugnant to it, and the carrying out of ' which would in no way affect us. I am going now to make a suggestion as to an alteration of the clause, which will prevent it from doing much harm. The clause provides that the Postmaster-General may direct that a letter shall not be delivered where he has reasonable grounds to suppose that money is being received for promoting or carrying out a scheme connected with a certain assurance in regard to any horse-race or - a lottery or scheme of chance not sanctioned by law, or an unlawful game. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I thought at first that they did so, but on further consideration I am of opinion that they do not. If we make them apply to the whole clause the position will be this : In Tasmania these sweeps or consultations are lawful, and senators shall not be able to pass a law interfering with them there ; but if the people of Tasmania send letters such as are provided for in the clause to Victoria, which is a highly moral country, and objects to these proceedings, or to South Australia, which is a still more moral country, and objects still further, the clause will providentially assist these States in upholding their own laws, and the letters which have been improperly and immorally addressed to them will be properly and morally refused delivery. That would leave us exactly where we are. </para>

                        <para>- What I submit to the Senate is this : Although we have powers which we ought to exercise when some great necessity arises, still we ought to be careful not to be too liberal in their exercise where the. result is . to interfere with existing States laws, where those State laws only affect the State, and have no influence on the other States, which are anxious for legislation in other directions. This Constitution is founded on the distinct understanding that only specific rights handed over shall be held by the Commonwealth and all the rest shall be left with the States, and we should be careful at the beginning not to extend our ultimate powers to their fullest extent. We should be cautious in our proceedings and not interfere with the financial or internal operations of any State unless some great public necessity requires it. I regret that at this early stage of the Commonwealth we have a Bill introduced which would have the effect of making the law of Queensland the law of all Australia - admitting- at the same time that the other States have laws a little less stringent, but very similar - and have the effect of interfering with the local government of Tasmania in a matter not specifically given away by Tasmania, but which only comes in by implication under the general power of dealing with posts and telegraphs, and which would also have the distinct effect of enabling the Commonwealth so to legislate as to interfere with a matter purely connected with the domestic economy of Tasmania. Victoria has its laws dealing with this subject, South Australia has passed her own laws upon the subject, New South Wales has adopted a similar line of action, Queensland has legislated according to her lights, but I do not think at this early stage we should make a special domestic law, which, though it covers the views of a number of the States, does not cover the views of all the States, and interferes by that means with the financial position of a State equally as good, as far as I know, equally moral, as far as I have ever heard, and equally entitled to its own self government. Practically what we are saying by this Bill is that Tasmania shall assimilate- its laws on the betting question to those of the whole of the rest of Australia, and as she has not done it, we will do it for her under the general power we have of dealing with posts and telegraphs, although we have no specific delegation of power to deal with the matter. I think it will be a mistake in policy for us to attempt to do that. It will make the initiation of our Commonwealth uncomfortable to some of the States and make them wonder what fresh power will next be exercised which the States have not anticipated and "which will work in a way that they never for a moment dreamt of. I would point out that the draftsman of this Bill appears to have contemplated in drafting it, as far as one portion of it is concerned, that it was not intended to interfere with State laws. My suggestion is hot to interfere with State laws. Let each State make its laws in this respect for itself, and then let the post-office administer them. Paragraph (6) says - </para>

                        <para>- Of course, we have all got our own opinions, and I do not wish to force my own views on any honorable senator. Still, I have no doubt whatever about it, and I hope I will satisfy my honorable friend who has just- interjected - and who I know is fair-minded and open to be convinced - -that there is no doubt that this power is possessed by the Commonwealth Parliament. What is the power? It is the power to carry mails throughout the whole Commonwealth, for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth, in order to enable the business transactions, and the social and commercial intercourse of the Commonwealth to go on free and uninterrupted from trammels of every kind. That duty is placed in the hands of the Commonwealth - the strong central authority. To enable it to carry out that duty with due regard to the interests of every portion of the Commonwealth, that power must be unfettered and untrammelled by obligations to any State. The only limit there is upon its right to cany out that duty in any way it thinks fit is the obligation to. treat every State fairly and equally. It cannot make differential charges. It cannot give one State an advantage over another. It must treat all States alike, but subject to that limitation it does appear to me to be entitled to perform its duty of taking charge of the mails and carrying them, and transacting the business of the Commonwealth in any way it thinks fit. It will be admitted I think that in the carrying of these mails, one of the first tilings it has to look at is the question of whether it is bound to lend itself to the distribution of matter which is generally admitted to be a public disgrace and a public scandal, and contrary to well recognised principles of morality. </para>

                        <para>- I do not mind an interruption that is to the point. My answer to the honorable and learned senator is this : I assent to the proposition, but the interruption does not explain why it is that we get the right to stop libellous, offensive, and seditious matter. I do not want to dwell any more than is necessary on that argument. Other honorable senators have yet to speak. If I have made my position clear I do not think it is necessary to labour it at any length. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I think the honorable and learned senator who interjects was slightly in error in .referring to that as direct legislation by the consent of the States. As a matter of "fact, so far as I am aware, there is no power under the Constitution of the United States to legislate upon matters outside of the Constitution by agreement, as there is under our Constitution. At all events, in that particular case which I hare quoted, there is' no doubt that it was admitted that the United States Government had no right whatever to legislate upon the question of lotteries, and yet that Government carried out what we are seeking to carry out here, by the simple process of refusing to carry or convey by means' of its postal conveyances or- vehicles matter which it ' thought or believed to be inimicable to the moral interests of the community. </para>

                        <para>-.- If the honorable and learned senator will pardon me for saying so, I think he is- confusing different questions, which must be separated if we are to decide this motion clearly. I quite agree as to the importance of the question we have to decide. We shall have such points continually cropping up for discussion; and unless we adopt some broad general principle to guide us it will be a very difficult matter to preserve intact the power which has been intrusted to us for the benefit of all Australia, and at the same time conserve those rights which the Constitution has intended should remain with the different States. It is only on broad general principles that you can arrive at a fair conclusion. Now I come to the particular matter with which we have to deal. I may say at once, and have no hesitation in saying, that I am not one of those who think that men can be made moral by Act of Parliament I have not very much belief in the efficacy of those laws which place obstacles in the way of gambling. I- would undoubtedly place obstacles in the way of gambling by young people, and would do my utmost to make the law so stringent as to be effective. But in regard to the elder people, considering that there are so many various ways in which gambling takes place, it is of very little value to legislate in regard to four or five instances out of a thousand. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt: Let me place another consideration before the Senate. I am very much afraid we are apt to be guided in our consideration of what is just and right to the Commonwealth in this matter by the -fact that this- law, if passed, may make a serious financial difference to Tasmania. I hope I may say, without offence' to that State, that her entrance into this union must necessarily involve sacrifices on her part. I am .quite certain that it is the desire of every member of the Commonwealth Parliament that those sacrifices shall be made as light and as easy to bear as possible. But to what extent is Tattersall's business a matter of such importance to Tasmania ? While Tattersall was able to canyon his business in five other States I do not suppose that the revenue Tasmania derived from the sweeps would have been a matter of very much concern. It is because Tattersall was driven out of every State- and finally concentrated in Tasmania that it has become such a matter of financial interest to that State. That reason is the justification for the legislative action that the Government now asks the Commonwealth Parliament to take. </para>

                        <para>- It may be that it shows the inefficacy of trying to suppress gambling by legislation, but that does not affect the position we are dealing with1 now, which is quite another thing. Let me put it to the Senate- and it is necessary to look at this point in order to come to a just conclusion - that before the- accomplishment of federation every one of the States, except Tasmania, exercising its own right as to what it thought; good' for the moral welfare of its people, decided that Tattersall was to be banished. In so far as concerned any operations of Tattersall conducted within their own boundaries, they had effectually got rid of him. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and the clause covers both the receipt and the transmission. The Commonwealth Government found that in all the Australian States laws were in existence preventing the transmission of this matter ; and were they to put those States in a worse position than they were in before, and to violate what their peoples believed to be for their best moral interest, in-order to allow a certain business to be continued in Tasmania? It is quite clear that it is perfectly easy to prohibit the receiving of letters from Tattersall in the various States, even if we cannot prevent the transmission to Tattersall of letters from those States. But would it not be the merest farce to wink at the transmission of letters to Tattersall from all parts of Australia, and to let the money get into the hands of Tattersall, and then to refuse to deliver the answers that were sent back? Is it not perfectly clear that by allowing money to be transmitted to Tattersall we should be offending the moral sense of the community as much as by allowing the answers sent by Tattersall to be returned. I ask the Senate to remember, in connexion with what has been said about the rightfulness and reasonableness, or otherwise, of exercising the power which it is admitted that we have to legislate in this way, the circumstances in which Australia is placed. No doubt the union of the States, while it brings immeasurable advantages, must bring inconveniences and losses. We wish to make those losses as light as possible, and to minimize the friction which must occur as much as we can ; but we cannot entirely avoid it, and when we must make a change, let us base it upon broad general principles of fairness. If we apply those principles to the present position, we must remember that it is only one State which is so strenuously and eloquently contending against the passing of this law, and. although the clause may, to a certain extent, injure the financial condition of Tasmania,, it will benefit the remaining five States of the union. I have taken up more tune in explaining the position of the Government with regard to this matter than, perhaps, I should have occupied, but I have spoken at length because I agree with what has been said by several speakers as to the importance of arriving at some broad general principle in dealing with this question. I hope that the Senate will adopt the principle which I have enunciated. It is a principle which, I believe, will be found to apply, not only to the matter with which we are now dealing, but to future questions of conflict between the rights of the Commonwealth and of the States with which we shall have to deal. </para>

                        <para>- No. An aspect of the question which has been dilated upon at considerable length by many honorable senators, is that the Postmaster-General should not be placed in the position of a despot, in being given the power to prevent letters from going to any particular individual. I am rather surprised that he is anxious to place himself in that position, because, when speaking in the Queensland Parliament in 1891 upon a similar Bill, he said : </para>

                    <para>It would generally act fairly enough ; but there have been cases - perhaps the Postmaster-General is aware of them - in which in order to get control of the wires and to prevent anybody else from using them, matter has been sent of a totally irrelevant character. One well-known case is that of a war correspondent who started transmitting the Bible and flooded the wires with Genesis until he got his proper message in order. That is not provided for. </para>

                        <para>- That is all right. With regard to the clause giving the Postmaster-General authority to refuse to deliver letters connected with gambling, consultations, and so on, I think the same objection would apply to that as I made to the 23rd section - that is that it leaves the Postmaster-General in the position of a despot, to decide whether those letters are objectionable or not. </para>

                        <para>- I utterly refuse to accept the argument that the fact of their asking the question proved that they thought the Commonwealth Parliament was going to take this action. The fact that they asked the question proves that they had studied the matter, and I again say that a majority of the people of that State thought that the Commonwealth Parliament would not take from the State a right which they regarded as resting with the State. If we look at it in the broad aspect, I think it is indeed a pity that at this early stage of our career as a nation any act of the Commonwealth Parliament should be such as to give the people of any State the idea that the Commonwealth Parliament is asking for powers which it never- led the States to understand it was going to ask for. That is one of the views that I hope senators whose minds are still open on the question will take into consideration. As to the question of the petitions that have been presented in this and another place, praying that so able a handmaiden of the Commonwealth as the-postrofB.ee should not be allowed to encourage gambling, a great deal may be said on both sides, but I am quite satisfied that the petition which is already in this Chamber, praying that this clause 54 may be struck out, is more numerously signed than are all the other petitions to the contrary. I go further, and say that in spite of the fact that three out of the six States have moved this person Tattersall on until he has found a resting place in Tasmania, yet if a vote were taken to-morrow of the electors of the Commonwealth throughout Australia as to whether Tattersall should be suppressed or not, the vote would be two to one in favour of striking out the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I have not said a word on this question yet, and I have listened to the debate on the constitutional aspect of it until I am quite satisfied the Government have the power to legislate in the way proposed. I am very pleased to see that the Government are going to stand firm by their Bill and not allow any single State to dictate the policy of the Commonwealth on a matter of such importance. I happened to be in Queensland when a measure was brought before the Parliament dealing with this question, and I supported it. I did so because I saw the evil effect of gambling on the people of the colony, and especially on the young people. It is the young people particularly that we have to consider in connexion with a question of this kind. I have seen boys of ten or twelve years of age going in. pairs to Tattersall's office and applying for consultation tickets. I have been stopped in the streets of Brisbane by girls of not more than ten or twelve years of age for shillings with which to buy tickets in Tattersall's sweep. I have known the father of a family coming home on Saturday night with his week's wages and taking a ticket in .Tattersall for each member of the family, thus spending the whole of his week's wages. The butcher and the baker had to wait for their money, and perhaps never got it at all. As I say, we have to consider the effect of this upon the young people. Those who have grown to maturity we need not bother about. The question is whether we shall protect the rising generation of the Commonwealth against such an influence as we see exercised in the different States where this form of gambling is allowed. It has been said by several senators that Tasmania is much purer than, and her general laws 'are far ahead of those of, the other States. If that is the case, the greater reason there is for stopping this form of gambling. ' I will say no more upon the question, but merely express my great pleasure that the Government intend to stand firmly to the Bill, and see that the clause is passed without any alteration whatever. </para>

                        <para>- I hope the honorable senator will not, because I want to comment upon it. The use of such words as " absurd " and " nonsense " are not argument. But I will put another case which is an excellent illustration. Not many years ago - perhaps they were barbarous times then - -trades unions or combinations of workmen, to raise wages, were looked upon as conspiracies, and the persons connected with them were subjected to trial as criminals. This is all remedied now by legislation of a more beneficent description. I admit that it is extravagent to suppose that such laws could be revived in Australia; but suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Commonwealth Parliament decided that trades unions should still be regarded as unlawful combinations, and that in order to put a Stop to anything of the kind the Parliament were to say, " we will not deliver any letters addressed to the secretary of any trades union or workmen's combination," do senators think that the Commonwealth Parliament would be at liberty to legislate to that effect whilst such combinations were still legal under the State laws ? Surely not. </para>

                        <para>- But though we say that such can be done on grounds of public policy, we are treading on totally different soil, so to speak, when we come to deal with these lotteries. The post-office has been set up as a great monopoly. The Commonwealth got this monopoly from the States. Upon what consideration is every monopoly supposed to rest ? It is supposed to rest upon the condition of great public advantage. That is all. The postal service was handed over to the Commonwealth on the condition that it should be maintained, to a great extent, on the same footing and according to the same principles as the State post-offices were maintained, and that all letters committed to the post-office under the federal regime by any citizen, postage paid, should be carried, transmitted, and delivered to their, destination, unless those letters were for purposes of crime, or were intended to endanger the State, or came under the categories which have not been made lawful in any State. That is the ground upon which we must consider this subject. We have not to consider whether these lotteries are immoral or not. I hold a strong view which I am quite free to express upon the subject. I altogether disapprove of Tattersall's. I am not looking with any favorable eye on the institution. I take the 'same view as other senators who have spoken, that an institution of this kind is to a certain extent a kind of moral, cancer. But I am having regard to the extreme question whether this clause involves any interference with the right of Tasmania. That seems to me to rest upon whether Tattersall's is a lawful business lawfully carried on under Tasmanian law. Are we entitled to refuse to cany letters intended for the person carrying on that business lawfully, and are we to refuse to deliver letters from him? It is admitted on all hands that we have no power to legislate for the purpose of putting down lotteries. But if that be so, why should we do the same thing indirectly ? The purpose of this clause is to put down lotteries in Tasmania. That is admitted. </para>

                        <para>- We should pass it whether Tasmania has passed a similar Act or not. The argument is that as five States have legislated, and the moral sense of five States is against Tattersall's sweeps, therefore, we should not tolerate the institution in Tasmania. </para>

We have heard it said over and over again in another State that the enormous profits derived from the totalizator have enabled larger stakes to be offered and bigger prizes to be run for, with the result that the breeding of racehorses has been stimulated and race meetings have been multiplied to an almost amazing degree. </para>

                        <para>- There are almost as many in South Australia, and the root of the mischief may be taken to lie in the breeding of race-horses. We are dealing now with the power of the Commonwealth, not with the question whether that power should be exercised, which is a question of expediency, and quite another matter. If the Commonwealth has power to legislate to indirectly hamper, impede, or prevent the carrying on of one lawful business, it has the same power in regard to another lawful business. The view to which I have been calling the attention of honorable senators is that which concerns the question of State rights, and I venture to say that the words " peace, order, and good government," which occur in the Constitution, do not carry the matter any further. They are merely an introductory phrase, meaning that we have power to legislate to that end, but only in regard to the subjects mentioned in what have been called the 39 articles of the Constitution. If those 39 articles had not been embodied in the Constitution, and the words had stood by themselves, we could have legislated upon any subject we chose ; but the words are restricted by those articles, which fix the sphere within which our legislative powers may be exercised. I have expressed my views as they have occurred to me in regard to this very serious and important subject rather fully, because it is really the first time that we have been brought face to face with a concrete instance of what we may b? called upon to consider an infringement of State rights. </para>

                        <para>- A high and a reliable authority on constitutional, law. But let me point out that it appears neither from that authority, nor from any other that is available to us, that there was. any law in the State concerned which expressly legalized lotteries, and placed them. ' in the position of ordinary businesses. It does not appear that the question of State* laws was involved at all, and therefore we are not able- to see to what extent the decision governs us, and should affect the language with which we are dealing. It does, not show that the particular difficulty which we are endeavouring to solve arose in America. I do not question it. J accept it implicitly, with all the weight and authority which the emphatic words of the "Vice President of the Executive Council gave it ; but it does not decide the question upon which we are now engaged, and which involves an interference with a legislative right which has actually been exercised by the State of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- In the face of the difficulty which the American authorities create, and the grave doubt that exists, the question is what ought we to do ? That brings us to the practical issue. If there were none of these American dicta, I should vote against the clause, or, at any rate, against that part of it which seems to me to interfere with the right of Tasmania to legislate upon social or business matters upon which she is competent to legislate. But the American authorities having raised a doubt, the whole question remains in a state of great uncertainty, and it seems to me that it will be safer to pass the clause,- because if it infringes State rights our decision will not be final. But if we eliminate the clause we assume to decide upon a very doubtful question, and it seems to me safer, therefore, to pass the clause, leaving it to Tasmania if she, on consideration, feels aggrieved, to appeal against it, than, by striking it out, to prevent it from being decided by the ultimate tribunal for the decision of all these constitutional matters. If it is struck out we cannot raise the question at all. If it is left in, Tasmania can. raise the question. On the whole it seems safer to leave it in. I say so reluctantly, because I dislike anything that seem to be suspicious, or to have the colour of interfering with the rights of the States whose autonomy we are pledged to preserve. I would rather solve the difficulty in favour of the rights of the States than against them. But after putting all small questions aside, looking at the matter from the constitutional point which many of us advocate, then I say we shall best consult the high purpose for which we were sent here and the advancement of the business of legislation by -passing the clause, and leaving Tasmania if she feels aggrieved, to exercise her privileges in having the matter determined by the tribunal constituted for such purposes. </para>

                        <para>- Not absolutely, but practically so. If. a lottery did not exist in Tasmania does the honorable senator assume that lotteries would not exist elsewhere ? Has he not received through the post-office communications inviting him to invest in lotteries in Germany? People with speculative propensities will indulge those propensities in lotteries; if not in Tasmania, in Germany, or, perhaps in America itself, where, notwithstanding that they have rigid legislation against lotteries, gambling is rife in many parts. </para>

                        <para>- Or in New Zealand. According to the international agreement, money can be sent out of the Commonwealth to lotteries in other parts. If we legislate in this indirect way, no matter what may be our moral sentiments, we must all recognise that our legislation to a great extent will be ineffective. When we have ineffective and inoperative legislation, we simply open the door to law breaking. Once that is done then is generated in the community a spirit of distrust and disregard of the laws. It is for this reason, and so that the Senate's opinion upon this matter may be exactly tested, that I move my amendment. Honorable senators will notice that if the clause is passed as it at present stands we shall be attempting, according to the Postmaster-General, to make uniform throughout the Commonwealth a provision which has existed in some of the State Acts. The provision is taken from the Queensland Act, which, I believe, is the most stringent of the lot. Without achieving any good results at all we shall have five of the States of the mainland practically giving to Tasmania legislation upon a matter in connexion with which Tasmania claims - and I think rightly claims - that she herself lias exercised her Legislative power. In her opinion she has exercised that power with a far greater degree of efficiency, and far more reasonably, and with far more effect than any of the five mainland provinces. It is for these reasons that I ask honorable senators to agree with me in inserting in the clause a provision that the person engaged in a business, and whose correspondence is to be stopped, must be engaged in it contrary to the laws of a State in the Commonwealth . </para>

                    <para>- I propose to exercise my right of voting on tins question, and I may therefore take advantage of the opportunity to state shortly the reasons for the vote I am " about to give. I have not the slightest doubt as to the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to pass this clause. Two points have been raised - first as to the ethics or morality of the law which now exists in Tasmania with regard to lotteries ; and secondly, as to whether it' is wise to interfere with State rights and interests in one of the first Bills the Commonwealth Parliament will pass. With respect to the ethics or morality of lotteries, I intend to express no opinion. But having taken a very strong - some people may perhaps think an extreme - view concerning State rights and interests, I wish to observe that in my opinion we ought not, although we have the power, by indirect legislation to interfere with matters concerning the State of Tasmania which have not been directly handed over to us. By the passing of this clause we should be in effect preventing the successful working out of an institution which the State of Tasmania has declared to be legal. I do not think it is wise and prudent to take that course ; therefore I shall give my vote in opposition to the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out that that is not a slight alteration of the original amendment, but a complete reversal of it. The amendment originally moved meant that the clause would operate except where Tattersall's sweeps were being conducted with the sanction of the laws of the State ; but I pointed out that, as it was being conducted contrary to the law of five of the States, the amendment would be inoperative. The amendment which the honorable and learned member has now moved means that the legislation of the five Australian States is to be overridden by that of Tasmania. </para>
