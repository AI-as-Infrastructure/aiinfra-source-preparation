It has also been suggested - and I think it ought to be done - that we should have copies of the statutes of the States in the Chamber.

                    <para>. - The House of Representatives has made several amendments in this clause. The clause, as it left the Senate, provided that the proprietor of a newspaper should register at the office of the Deputy Postmaster-General, and that the Deputy Postmaster-General might at any time refuse to register or remove from the register any newspaper which contained certain objectionable matter. It is considered that that would put rather too much power in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General, and would not sufficiently protect the rights of the newspaper proprietor. Therefore the clause has been amended so that the Deputy Postmaster-General shall have no power to refuse to register, but that if anything of an objectionable nature is published he may call upon the proprietor to show cause why the newspaper should not be removed from the register. After that the name may be removed, but an appeal is allowed to a justice of the </para>

                    <para>- I think the committee may well agree that the particular amendment now under discussion is an improvement on the clause as it left the Senate. There was a great deal of difficulty raised by a number of honorable senators with regard to placing such uncontrolled power in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General without any appeal to a Justice of the High Court of Australia, or a Judge of any Supreme Court. But this appeal has now been given, and I think the clause has been amended in a right direction. </para>

                        <para>- Not so clearly. The clause calls upon a man whose newspaper is alleged to contain obscene or indecent matter to show cause, and if he is removed from the register' he may appeal. I should like to say a few words with regard to the omission of the words "seditious" and "blasphemous." There was a great deal of uneasy feeling, if I may so express it, amongst honorable senators as to how those words would be interpreted. Once it is made perfectly clear and certain that the interpretation is not to be left in the hands of a Government official, but will be, if necessary, in the hands of a Judge of the High Court or a Supreme Court Judge in any State, we safeguard the newspaper proprietors and the public generally. It would be a very reasonable thing to re-insert the words " seditious " and " blasphemous " and then accept the whole clause in its amended form. By that means we should agree to the amendment inserted by the other House with regard to the revision of the register being only made after notice has been given to the proprietor of the paper to show cause why his journal should not be removed. Then there is a further provision that if an officer says that a certain paragraph is seditious or blasphemous, the newspaper proprietor shall have a right to appeal from that official to a Judge. We know perfectly well that our Judges are placed in such a position that they are absolutely free from any pressure that might be brought to bear upon them.. In fact, no man would attempt to influence a Judge of one of our Supreme Courts. By this means we shall protect the newspaper people and the public. It would be a dangerous thing to say that a newspaper containing seditious or blasphemous matter should be allowed to be transmitted through the post. To do so would be to outrage the susceptibilities of a large section of the public, and to gratify a certain amount of malicious feeling that may exist amongst a few people in the community. We should be doing an intense injury to the community at large by allowing the Post-office to be used for the transmission of matter of that description. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with the honorable senator, but that is safeguarded by another clause of the Bill. This clause only deals with newspapers, and I hold that if the words "seditious" and " blasphemous " are reinserted, we shall be safeguarding the general public, and not injuring newspaper proprietors. It will be perfectly safe to leave it to a Judge of the High Court or of any Supreme Court to determine whether matter is " seditious " or " blasphemous " if there is any doubt about it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator might as well say that a Judge cannot decide any matter that comes before him better than any one else. We must have some tribunal to decide such points, and if we are not satisfied to allow them to be determined by the deputy Postmaster-General, we shall be absolutely safe in leaving them to be decided by a Judge. This power of appeal will make the Deputy Postmaster-General more cautious than he would otherwise be, because it will be known that the exercise of the power conferred by the clause will be subject to consideration at the hands of the highest tribunal in the Commonwealth, the High Court of Justice. If we cannot trust a Judge of the High Court or of a Supreme Court to deal with matters of this kind, we are in a very parlous state indeed. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the amendment of the House of Representatives will be agreed to. I hold no brief for any one who would attempt to distribute through the Post-office blasphemous or seditious matter. But there is considerable difficulty in determining what is seditious or blasphemous. While, as the honorable and learned senator has said, it will be safer to leave the exercise of this power in the hands of a Judge, nevertheless a certain amount of inconvenience and damage may be done to a newspaper proprietor before the matter comes before the Judge. The Deputy Postmaster-General can call upon a newspaper proprietor to show cause why his paper should not be removed from the register on the ground that " seditious " or " blasphemous " matter has appeared in it. The proprietor will thereby be put to expense on account of what may be an unfounded suspicion on the part of the Deputy Postmaster-General. I do not know whether in that case the Judge would award costs against the Post-office. His power enables the Deputy Postmaster-General to persecute a newspaper proprietor by calling upon him to show cause why a certain edition of his paper should not be treated as containing "seditious " and " blasphemous " matter, and why he should not be liable to the penalty of having his name removed from the register of newspapers. A wide interpretation is sometimes placed on these words. What is " blasphemous " to one section of the community is not to another. To some extent the same remark applies to the word " seditious." After all, can we not rely on the good judgment of the people who keep these papers in circulation. If a paper uses seditious and blasphemous language will it not damage itself ? This is grandmotherly legislation, which will not have the effect intended. I have sufficient confidence in the people of Australia to believe that any newspaper that uses such language within the meaning of this clause will be so treated by the people as to make it unprofitable for it to be published. I trust that the committee will agree to the amendment made by the House of Representatives. </para>

                <para>SenatorFRASER. - I am quite willing to leave that to the Postmaster-General or a Judge, or to both. But I say that it is unsafe and dangerous to the welfare of the community to allow such stuff to be. circulated broadcast. When it is said that we can rely on the people it must be remembered that the people, in the aggregate, do not take action. I should be quite willing to trust people of mature age, but we dare not, and ought not, to trust children in this matter. Why are children sent to school, and kept under discipline from their infancy to womanhood and manhood? Is is not in order to discipline and train their minds, and where shall we be if we allow this kind of matter to be circulated to counteract that training and discipline ? I hope we shall do what is right in this case. There will be no danger to the community if we follow on the lines upon which the old country, and every other country whose history is worth talking about, have gone. </para>

                    <para>- I am surprised that we should be asked to accept this amendment. There is or is not such a thing as sedition in the world, and surely a Judge of the Supreme Court knows what sedition is. I believe that every member of the committee knows it, and if an article is seditious, we should not allow it to go through the post-office. With regard to the word " blasphemous " there may be a difference of opinion, but we shall, I think, be safe in keeping that word in also. We have seen something which was very like a rebellion in a part of Australia before now, and we may see such a thing again. I hope we shall adhere to our previous decision in this matter. </para>

                        <para>-- Political events sometimes move so quickly that it does not take a generation to make changes. In times of political strife and change, a statement might be considered seditious which a few months later might be regarded as perfectly innocent. We might never have such things occurring in Australia as have occurred in the United States of America, but it is possible that they may occur. What was sedition before the American revolution was quite a different thing a few months after the revolution. </para>

                        <para>- As the law stands to-day a man is liable to punishment for sedition or blasphemy. That being the case, honorable senators may ask why we should interfere with a newspaper. My reply to such an argument is that if these are offences against the State, the Government should not be the means of disseminating them broadcast throughout the. country when committed through the medium of a newspaper. If we say it is a crime for a man to be guilty of sedition, then by what process of reasoning can we justify the demand that the Postmaster-General should spread sedition over the country. The same argument applies to blasphemy. If blasphemy is a crime, how can we say that the Government should spread a blasphemous publication all over the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- I have given the committee a definition. An honorable senator has suggested that by inserting these words in the Bill we shall interfere with the liberty of the press. The interjection that it would be an interference with the licence, and not the liberty, of the press was well justified. Then it is said that the public themselves will be the judges in this matter. Do we not know, however, that at times certain newspapers are guilty of gross sedition and blasphemy, and yet they live, to the disgrace, be it said, of the community in which they exist. I tra not going to name an}' newspapers, but we must recognize that fact. These words constitute no menace to any respectable well-conducted journal which is prepared to expose with no sparing hand abuses that exist in our midst. If honorable, senators say it is improper to permit the Postmaster-General to distribute through the Post-office newspapers that contain indecent or obscene matter, how much more justified are they in declaring that seditious or blasphemous publications should not be permitted to go through the post? </para>

                        <para>- I have already shown that there is a definition of these words in existence. If a Deputy Postmaster-General determines to remove a newspaper from the register, and the matter goes on appeal to the High Court or to the Supreme Court, the presiding Judge will not manufacture a definition or a law in order to mete it out to any particular newspaper. He will take a broad definition and say - " Does this publication come within that provision? If I have any doubts in my mind I will uphold the appeal against the Deputy Postmaster-General." </para>

I shall always endeavour to do so, but fairly and justly, and with full consideration for the proprietor of the newspaper.

                    <para>- I am sorry that such warm feeling has been exhibited. From the arguments of honorable senators, it is quite clear that there is almost a unanimous opinion that the word blasphemy might be omitted. The word seditious is not so difficult to define as the word blasphemous. One word deals with spiritual matters, and the other with material matters ; and seeing that sedition is practically opposition to the civil law, we might retain that word and omit the other. I know there is sometimes a feeling that even the very active spirits in a strike over labour matters may be charged with being seditious. But I do not think there is any possibility, in a fair strike for better conditions, of any of the actions of the parties concerned being brought under the word seditious, so long as it is a legitimate agitation for better conditions socially or politically. I do not think we shall jeopardize our liberty one bit by retaining the word. We want to prevent a newspaper or a person from using the post-office to stir up an agitation against civil law which may lead the people into an insurrection. In the present state of society, we are perfectly justified in retaining the word "seditious," but I shall support the omission of the word "blasphemous." </para>

                    <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation with regard to the two divisions which have just taken place. I regret not having been able to take part in them, and I make the explanation in order that the matter of which I complain may be rectified. I was called away a little while ago to receive a deputation, and before going I stated to the Postmaster-General that I should be in the waiting-room, and that as soon as the division bell rang I would come in and vote. But there seems to be no bell in the waiting-room. No sound came to me to warn me that any division was about to take place. Otherwise I should have been in my place. Surely it is too bad that honorable senators who are called away to discharge duties in connexion with public matters should not be informed when divisions are about to take place on most important matters. I trust that this defect will be rectified. I strongly object to being excluded from any division through the lack of proper appliances in the waitingrooms. I resent what has happened very much. </para>

                        <para>- I have not changed my opinions. These words " not sanctioned by law " were put into the Queensland statute in order that the provisions of the clause might not apply to the case of a lottery, or church bazaar ; which had been sanctioned by the Attorney-General. The clause, as we passed it, provided for the interference of the Postmaster-General, if he had reasonable ground to suppose any person to be engaged in the Commonwealth, or elsewhere, in receiving money or any valuable things - </para>

                    <para>-The Postmaster-General will admit that this amendment raises the original question discussed upon the clause. I do not propose to reopen it. My opinions on the subject are as strong now as when we previously debated it ; but I am always willing to give my adherence to the majority, as the voting in this Chamber indicates. I rose to ask a question of the Postmaster-General with respect to the expression "not sanctioned by law." I pointed out when we were discussing the matter previously that if the Senate wanted the wishes of the majority carried into effect these words " not sanctioned by law" should be left out. The Postmaster-General at the time said he could not agree with me. If I felt that the Postmaster-General were now of the same opinion as he was when we previously discussed the matter I should deem it my duty to urge the committee to restore the words ; but I am convinced that the honorable and learned senator, like the rest of us, occasionally makes a mistake, and freely recognises it. I therefore do not propose to move for the restoration of these words. We all know that this clause 55 aims at suppressing the institution known as Tattersalls, and aims at suppressing what has received the sanction of Tasmanian legislation. </para>

                        <para>- If this is enforced at the present time, Tasmania will have no right of appeal, because there is no court to appeal to. All that I am urging now is that the Postmaster-General should not attempt to enforce the clause until the Federal High Court is established. I am urging this on behalf of my State, and I put it to every honorable senator, however anxious he may be to suppress gambling, whether it is not a fail' and rightful thing to give Tasmania an opportunity of appealing directly this clause is put into force. If it is put into force before the High Court is established, the legislative action of the State will have been interfered with without giving her an opportunity of redress, even though her demand for redress may be based upon solid grounds. If the Postmaster-General will give me an assurance to that effect, I shall say no more. I have deemed it necessary to draw the attention of the committee to the existing state of affairs, and to remind honorable senators that if the clause is passed as it stands, and enforced, Tasmania will have no right of appeal. "Tattersall" will be suppressed at once, and Tasmania will have no opportunity of making a formal and legal protest. </para>

                <para>This perhaps is rather important. We come now to the telegraph clauses of the Bill, and it is right that the amendments should be understood before they are passed. The new paragraph inserted by the House of Representatives has probably been introduced because of the powers that have been given, mostly by the Queensland Government to private companies to work telegraph lines in connexion with their own railways and tramways. It seems to me to be reasonable that where such powers have been conferred by State Acts they should be continued under the Commonwealth. I do not see that in taking over the Post and Telegraph department we can claim the power to interfere with rights which have been conferred on those companies under State Acts. </para>

                        <para>- We could not do that with a cable. We are introducing the underground system, and to carry a cable containing probably 100 wires over a building would involve an enormous expenditure. Surely it is much better that we should be able to take the wires through the cellar or basement of any intervening building. </para>

                    <para>- I entirely disagree with the Postmaster-General. It is quite right that permission should be given to the department to attach their wires to buildings, but it is a different thing altogether to allow the wires or cables to be carried through private buildings. Such a course would not only cause inconvenience, but would carry with it the right of the officers of the department to go through the premises at all reasonable times in order to see if the wires were in repair. It might seriously interfere with the title to a property. Such a power is not taken in London. There all the wires are carried over or along and not through buildings. I would give the department every legitimate assistance in carrying out its work for the benefit of the community, but we should not interfere unnecessarily with private rights. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the omission of the words " in or " would destroy the ordinary meaning of the clause, to say nothing of the principle involved. It would make the clause absolutely nonsensical. . It is not readable or acceptable in its present form. But, coming to the principle, why should the Minister and his officers be hampered in their desire to serve the public? </para>

                        <para>- Then the Minister should not get that power, because if a wire is taken through a building, and is not properly cared for, it is dangerous to human life. There seems to be no reason to have a wire going through a building. Can the Minister cite one case where a wire goes through a building? If he can, it should receive proper consideration. We do not object to telegraph wires being laid through private gardens and cutting off angles and crossing streets, but the Postmaster-General should stop there. . We should, at any rate, prevent him going into a dwelling-house with a dangerous wire which might cause the death of some person. </para>

                        <para>- When the telephone system is laid on to every house, and every proprietor has to pay, whether he wants the service or not, the same as he has to do for his water, no doubt we shall be able to run cables all round the streets to every man's door. We want this power, not for the telegraph system, but for the telephone system. Supposing that a large building is put up, and that a number of persons there desire to be connected with the Exchange, they may want a dozen wires laid on to the building. We wish to take the wires in a cable by the shortest route through private property. If they are aerial wires, the difficulty will not occur, because then we can attach them to the building, and go by the shortest route. But if we can get them underground, which we are trying to do as much as possible, we claim that we should be allowed to take them by the most direct route. </para>

What is the use of spending money when there is no necessity for it ? What is the use of making a nuisance of the telephone system? It is not desirable that a cable should be put through any man's house, whereby his children and family will be liable to be maimed for life. Honorable senators know very well that the law prevents a man from keeping gunpowder or other explosives in his house, but they are not half so dangerous as an electric cable. </para>

                    <para>- There are three amendments in this clause, and I propose to ask the committee to accept two of them, and to disagree to the other. I should like to say a few words on the clause generally in order to explain the reason of my objection to one of the amendments. In connexion with the last clause, we have been speaking of the underground system of telephones, and I want the Senate to understand some of the difficulties we have to meet with in connexion with the aerial system in consequence of the growing of ornamental trees in towns and suburbs. The practice is very commendable, indeed, from a health and aesthetic point of view, but the difficulty is that the local authorities plant a row of trees just underneath our telegraph wires, and as they grow up in the course of a few years, they come into contact with the wire. We desire to have the power to lop the trees where they interfere with the telephone service. The minimum height of our wires is 18 feet, and what we ask is that when the trees grow so high as to interfere with the wires, we shall have authority to lop them. We endeavour to meet local authorities by giving them an opportunity to lop their trees themselves, but if they do not do so, we want to have the authority to lop them. We are now confronted with this difficulty that the local authorities have taken up the position sometimes of saying - "We want to have our trees, and we will not allow you to cut them. If you do cut them we shall bring an action for damages against you." They go so far as to say that we cannot compel them to cut their trees, and that if we do not like it we should take our wires away and put them under ground. When we consider the miles and miles of trees planted, it must be seen that we must continue the aerial system or else have no telephone service at all in some of the suburbs, because of the enormous expense that would be incurred in putting the wires under ground. The Bill has been so amended by the House of Representatives that we have no absolute right to interfere with the trees, and another provision has been altered in such a way that a local authority may claim damages against the department for lopping their trees and may insist upon their claim being submitted to arbitration. That would mean that the cost of carrying on the telephone service would be altogether beyond what could be borne. I have a statement here with reference to one instance which came under my notice for the first time the other day. It is a New South Wales case and the statement is as follows : - </para>

                    <para>Some time since owing to the complaints that were made regarding the unsatisfactory working of a telephone exchange, it was considered necessary by the Post and Telegraph authorities in Sydney to lop some of the limbs of the trees which came in contact with the wires, and interfered with the proper working of the telephone system. Several deputations from the residents waited upon the Postal authorities in Sydney to protest against any interference with the trees, and, as a result, it was decided to defer the matter for further consideration. It was then suggested to the department that it should place the wires underground, but the expense involved (over £3,000) would have been so great that this request was declined. The next proposal was that the wires should be raised about 60 feet from the ground ; this was declined, but the department expressed its willingness to meet the wishes of the residents by providing higher poles, on condition that the expense involved would be borne by the residents, but this was not agreed to. Suggestions have since been made to the department by the Mayor to overcome the difficulty by a zigzag system in regard to the poles and wires, the adoption of which, however, has been reported against by the chief electrician in Sydney on the grounds of expense and impracticability. </para>

                    <para>- This is indeed a very important amend men t. Honorable senators will recollect that when the Bill was first introduced the Postmaster-General claimed the right of control over all telephone and telegraph lines, whether they went through private land or not. The proposal created a great deal of disturbance throughout the States, and protests against this power being held by the Postmaster-General came from all parts, inasmuch as on many large stations there are a number of private telephone lines. Ultimately the Postmaster-General himself saw the fairness of the complaint, and certain new clauses were put in to allow private owners to erect and maintain telephone lines, and provision was made also for the crossing of roads by private lines. It is now proposed by this amendment that the Postmaster-General shall, after six months' notice, be given the power to resume any or the whole of these lines. I can hardly think the honorable and learned senator is serious in making such a proposal as this. It will not be a small matter in the case of telegraph and telephone wires on station properties. They extend all over the States, and there are many thousands of miles of them. The provision also affects telephones in private houses. They can be resumed under it by the Postmaster-General. I do not imagine that the power would be used so absurdly, but it certainly does embrace all private telephone and telegraph lines. To my mind, it is a most monstrous proposal, and to agree to it would be to conflict with the action that we took on a previous occasion, after very grave consideration of important representations made to us. I should like to hear from the Postmaster-General the reason that has led to his change of opinion, because he acquiesced in the fairness of the former amendment. It is idle to talk of compensation. What compensation could be given to a large stationholder if he received six months' notice that the whole of the telegraph and telephone lines on his runs were to be taken over by the department ? </para>

                        <para>- It could not be estimated. These lines are erected on station properties for business purposes, just as in cities and towns telephones are. put up in large and small establishments. No compensation could possibly meet such cases. Apart from that consideration, however, if we adopt this proposal we shall destroy absolutely the principle laid down by us, after grave consideration, that the Postmaster -General should not have anything to do with private lines. </para>

                        <para>- This amendment seems to me to be in conformity with the principle laid down in clause 78 with regard to telegraphs. That clearly states that, with certain exceptions, the telegraph system is a monopoly, the exception being made, we may say, in the case of private lines. This clause carries out the principle which is generally accepted in democratic communities, that everything connected with communications within the country shall be subject to State control. In agreements for the building of private railways a clause is carefully inserted, in nearly every case, providing for the right of the State to come in at some time or other and acquire the line. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt this would be an extremely high-handed proposal, if provision was not made for compensating fairly the person from whom a line is taken over. Seeing that the telegraph system is a State monopoly, I do not think it is unreasonable to provide that the Postmaster-General shall have power to acquire these lines and convert them into public ones, if it is necessary to do so, in the public interest. It is all very well to say that the Postmaster-General should shrink from taking such a power, but if it is for the public good, then it is for him to undertake it. That is what Parliament has to consider. The House of Representatives has inserted this provision, and if we assent to it, it will become the duty of the Postmaster-General, as public necessity requires, to exercise this power. </para>

It is not at all likely that he would enter upon any large transaction, such as the purchasing of a cable or an extensive private Une, without going to Parliament. He would probably put the amount required on the Estimates, and then under our Constitution the expenditure of that amount would have to receive the approval of both Houses of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- If he is the only employe in the office, he must be in charge of that office. Seeing that that definition practically means that there is an officer in charge of every post - office, I think the House of Representatives has made this amendment with a view of giving to every telegraph officer in charge of an office the power to refuse a telegram if it contains libellous matter. If there is a postmaster in charge, the operator will not act upon his own responsibility, but must refer the matter to the judgment of the officer in charge, who is responsible for the acts of his subordinates. It is just as well that we should be careful about this provision, because the stoppage of a telegram might involve a question of law, and might involve the department in damages. I trust that, in the interests of his own department, the Minister will withdraw his motion. </para>

                    <para>- I understand that clause 93 is the clause giving power to make regulations for certain purposes under the Bill. But since we passed it clause 25a has been inserted providing for electoral lists and ballot-papers, where there is voting by post and so on, and providing that the State shall pay the cost of postage in such cases. Hence it is necessary to add to clause 93 a power to make regulations dealing with that matter. But the amendment the Postmaster-General now proposes goes further than that, and provides for the payment " by any persons." I point out that we have not provided an enacting clause dealing with " any persons," and I think it would be better to postpone the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- Before this amendment is agreed to I should like a little fuller explanation from the Postmaster-General as to the meaning of "earthed returns." We are not all experts. I have in my mind the case of overhead lines, which was thoroughly debated on a former occasion, when we came to the conclusion that the Postal department ought to be thoroughly guarded. The overhead line of the Perth Electric Tramway Company interfered with the Postal department's lines, and involved the Government in serious expense. </para>

                        <para>- Every line must have either a metallic circuit or an earthed return. A current of electricity must be either brought back by means of a metallic circuit or through the earth. The metallic wire is by far the better, but it is also the more expensive system. We have earthed returns in many cases, because we have not been able to go to the expense of providing a metallic circuit.' This proposed new clause provides that if the line of any electrical authority injuriously affect a Government line in connexion with which the more expensive system is not employed, that authority is not to be liable for the damage if it can show that it has adopted all known and reasonable precautions to avoid it, and has complied with the regulations. If we have a metallic circuit, then the case comes under clause 142, and if our wires affect those of any private authority the question arises as to which was erected first. The unfairness of this proposal is that it compels us to adopt the metallic circuit, but does not compel the electric lighting authorities to do the same. </para>

                        <para>- We have one instance quoted in Victoria, but that does not detract from what I say, that a man appointed during good behaviour is appointed for life, and until he is dropping into the grave. I think that is not desirable. Seven years seem to be a long enough term, and there should be some term fixed after which Parliament may have an opportunity to reconsider the whole matter. This matter of boards and commissioners has been before several of the States, and there is hardly one State Parliament that has not had cause to alter its mind, not within seven years, but within three or four years. We are commencing our history now under new circumstances, and it is desirable that within the next seven years the Parliament of the Commonwealth should have an opportunity of reconsidering this whole matter. We have had this Bill subjected during the last few weeks to the severest criticism, and are we now to assume all at once that the Parliament of the Commonwealth will not change its mind, not in the next seven years, but in a much longer period, and that it is desirable for us now to appoint a man to this position practically for life ? I think it far better to appoint him for the term provided for, and I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I should have preferred an amendment striking out subclause (2) altogether, and having no provision as to the term of office at all. By doing that we should place the commissioner on the same footing as any other officer in the service, and for the life of me I cannot see why he should be in any other position. I do not see why the " Commissioner of Toorak " should hold office for a term of seven years, and " George Jones" the postman should only hold his position so long as he does his duty. I hold that, no matter how high and responsible a position may be, the officer appointed to it should not hold it upon different terms to the humblest employe in the service. </para>

                        <para>- So far as the Public Service Commissioner is concerned, I oppose the appointment, and, in fact, I oppose the whole Bill in so far as it provides for this commissioner and inspectors. I believe that if we passed a simple Civil Service Bill, leaving it to Ministers to 'manage, so long as we laid down the principles regulating appointments and promotions in the service, we should do better. The Ministry would be bound to obey, and we might fairly leave it to Ministers to carry out the provisions ve made as they have been carried out in South Australia from the beginning of responsible Government there, and so far as I know, without the slightest hitch. I can only account for the different experience of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland by the fact that the moral sense of the people of those States must be upon a lower standard than that of the people of the model State. If we passed a proper Civil Service Bill, and had honest and intelligent Ministers, there is no reason why it should not work fairly and well. </para>

                        <para>- And I am supporting it so far as it regards the commissioner, and also as regards the inspectors. There is a question to be considered which has not yet been brought before the Senate. We have two classes of public servants. We have a class appointed under special Acts of Parliament, and another class of ordinary public servants. The first class includes the Governor-General, in our case, and the Governors in the various States ; the Ministers, the Auditor-General, who stands between Parliament and the Ministry, and is the servant of Parliament, and is not responsible to the Ministry, and also the Agent-General, whose appointment has only been for a limited time, of late years. We appoint all these officers under special Acts, and put them on an absolutely higher and different plane from any of the ordinary officers of the public service. What are we going to do in this 5th clause? We are absolutely proposing that, so far as this Public Service Commissioner is concerned, we shall take him out of the ordinary category of civil servants. We might find some excuse for that in the case of the Public Service Commissioner, because he will be an exceedingly important officer, and it might not be convenient that Parliament should have the right to discuss yearly questions connected with his department unless a special motion is brought forward. But why on earth we should put these inspectors, who are his underlings, on a higher place than the heads of the Customs department and the Post-office department, I cannot understand at all. We are going to put these inspectors, who are merely servants of the commissioner, in a position above that of the Deputy Postmaster-General. I say it is simply monstrous to place these men in that position. This Public Service Commissioner has no more difficult work and no more important functions to fulfil than the Auditor-General, and we propose to give him £1,500 a year, while we propose to give our Auditor-General only £1,000 a year. The Auditor-General is a far more important officer. He is an officer of Parliament, standing between Parliament and the Ministry, and he has to see that the sums of money voted by Parliament are properly expended, and reports to Parliament, if there are any laches on the part of the Ministry of the day. This Public Service Commissioner will only have to carry out provisions of a special Act of Parliament, under which we regulate how men shall be received into the service, and how they shall be promoted. He will have no independent functions to perform as the Auditor-General has, and yet we are giving him a position equal to that of the Auditor - General. If we appoint inspectors to an equally high position, and if they travel about the public offices in the States standing on a higher platform than the heads of the departments in the States, we shall make a great mistake. The salaries of the inspectors ought to be voted by Parliament, year by year, just as the salaries of civil servants are voted. The more numerous you make the body of men who are not subject to parliamentary criticism and control, the greater mistake you will make. Why should the inspectors be above the criticism of Parliament when the Deputy Postmaster-Generals and Collectors of Customs, who occupy far more important positions, are liable to its criticism? The proposition is perfectly monstrous. Not a word can be said in favour of putting the inspectors on this high plane. I would strike out all reference to the inspectors, and allow the commissioner to appoint his own men, and to call them what he likes. It is outrageous to single them out for special consideration and special appointment. Why should not the Ministry have to come before Parliament and say, " We want so many inspectors - we want a man for little Tasmania at £600 a year, and a man for big New South Wales at £800 a year," varying the salary according to the work which the man has to do. Directly the Bill is passed the Ministry can appoint six inspectors. </para>

                        <para>- I do not necessarily approve of all the amendment. I approve of that part which makes the appointment during good behaviour, or until the office is done away with. But I do not approve of the provision that the commissioner is not to be removed until an address is presented from both Houses. There is no necessity for that provision. He ought not to be placed on the same plane as the Judges, or in a better position than the heads of the big departments. </para>

                        <para>- Not at all. The departments administered by the officers in question came under review, and when those Estimates were under discussion, any member was at liberty to discuss the departments, and all their branches. Of course, we did hot light-heartedly pass criticisms upon the Judges, but on several occasions I, myself, have discussed the travelling allowances paid to Judges when thought they were too high. I think seven years is a reasonable term for which to appoint a commissioner. If he discharges his duty so has to give satisfaction, he need have no fear that at the end of his term his position will not be renewed at the hands of Parliament or at the hands Of the Ministry who are the executive of Parliament. I feel certain that there will be no difficulty whatever in regard to the renewal of the commissioner's term of office, and I think it would be a mistake when we are passing the first Public Service Bill of the Commonwealth to fix any other term than that fixed in the Bill. </para>

If the tenure is for life, as in the case of Judges, we should understand it, but if the tenure is for anything short of life, the whole question that I have been discussing is opened. I have always said that we may appoint these boards, and they are very good, because they give the Ministry a good way of getting out of a lot of trouble they would otherwise be placed in. They make a most convenient buffer between the Ministry and Parliament. </para>

                        <para>-No, no ; they give them a chance to avoid great injustice, and to avoid a multiplicity of details which they have no time to deal with properly. They are, therefore, good. But when it comes to a substantial question of real responsibility, the Ministry have got to bear it. Under all constitutional governments we are acquainted with, these temporary boards are something between the Ministry and Parliament, by which the Ministry throw off from themselves, when they please, responsibilities which their numerous occupations prevent them properly attending to, and which are very well thrown off. They relieve them from importunities which would otherwise be placed on them, but ultimately, when it comes to a truly crucial question, then let the boards be what they will, and appoint them for seven years, or for fourteen years if we like, and the responsibility ultimately comes back to the Government, which means to Parliament. And it is a bad thing for these so-called independent boards, whether they are appointed for six months, seven years, or fourteen years, if they do not obey the requests of the Government and the Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very good way of controlling public affairs, because these gentlemen will be much better able to judge what is proper to be done than a Minister, importuned by his political friends or fearful of his political enemies. When it comes to the last the Public Service Commissioner will have to be- subservient to the Government whether we say he is independent or not. That, however, will only happen occasionally, and in the meantime he will relieve the Ministry of much importunity, and he will relieve the public of very much expenditure that might otherwise be entailed. </para>

                    <para>- After a long and hard fight, those who contended against the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner and inspectors -were defeated. I have no. desire now to return to that question. We have now to consider for how long the commissioner and inspectors are to be appointed, and those who have been against the appointment of a commissioner are justified in saying that his appointment should be from year to year, the same as that of the Deputy Postmaster-General's, and other public servants. After all, the purpose in appointing a Public Service Commissioner and inspectors, is to organize the public service of the Commonwealth, and we do not suppose for a moment that it will take seven years for the commissioner and his inspectors to properly organize the two departments we have taken over. </para>
