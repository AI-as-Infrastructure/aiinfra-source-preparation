                    <para>During the present session, which stand at the end of the motion upon the paper. I recognise that in the present condition of public business in both Houses of the Legislature it would be useless to move the latter part of the motion, asking for the introduction of a measure during the present session, and in order that the question may be dealt with on its merits I have amended the motion. Perhaps there may be in the minds of some honorable senator some slight misapprehension through a possible confusion of terms. My motion does not indicate, or desire to indicate, that in the view of the Senate the separate States should deal with the great question of industrial insurance, but that State insurance should be established by the Commonwealth. I am aware that State insurance, as generally understood, is insurance with the Government of the country. In this case it will be insurance with the Commonwealth. But the term " Commonwealth insurance " would-be so absolutely novel and so utterly misapprehended - probably in the States, and even in Parliament itself - that I prefer to stick to the well-known phrase "State insurance" - meaning by that national insurance. </para>

                        <para>.- It is. I think the phrase of the Commonwealth Constitution Act itself is unfortunate. There is in the Act a conflict of terms, because the word " State " is used in two places meaning evidently in one place " Government," and in the other the "local or separate States." In rising to address myself to this proposition, I desire to point out to the Senate that the subject is of the utmost importance: first, to those engaged in industrial pursuits ; secondly, to all employers, including the Government itself; and, thirdly, to the entire community. State insurance in respect of industrial accident has not hitherto attracted much public attention in Australia. In New South Wales, at any rate, I believe that I was the first public man to make this subject an active political question. During my candidature for a seat in the Senate, I addressed myself to the question at every meeting of the electors. I promised then to do that which I am now humbly attempting to accomplish - to bring this great political and social question before the notice of the Federal Parliament. Some four years ago, empowered by a commission under the great seal of New South Wales, I visited Europe to investigate the question of old-age pensions and charitable relief. It was then that my attention was most strongly drawn to industrial insurance. I found that the question was so entirely interwoven with provision for old age and the distribution of charitable' relief that I perhaps stretched the limits of the authority granted to me, and reported as fully on industrial assurance as I did upon the subjects more specifically set out in my instructions. I had an opportunity of investigating those matters practically on the spot. I had the rare opportunity of securing from diplomatic and business sources a copy of every Act on the subject of Industrial insurance that had been passed in every European country, and a copy of almost every measure on the question which had been introduced in the Legislatures of the Continent. For the first time, these documents were all translated into the language that we speak, and taking these facts into consideration, I believe that I have had unrivalled opportunity of gaining a complete knowledge of what has been attempted for the benefit of the workers in the great countries of Europe. My inquiries have so thoroughly convinced me of the urgency of the insurance of workers by and with the State that I have become a strong advocate of . the principle. I hope that honorable senators who have or may peruse my report, and who do me the honour of hearing what I have to say on the subject, will become as warmly interested in it as I am. I trust that honorable senators will give me their influence and assistance in promoting the accomplishment of a scheme designed to do so much for employers and employes, and, indeed, for all among whom it is inaugurated. State insurance is the evolutionary product of efforts made during many -centuries past to cope with accidents and injuries inseparable from industrial pursuits. Here let me draw attention to the antiquity of some of the provisions made, not only by the workers themselves, but by those from whom a benevolent regard for the workers would scarcely be expected. In Prance, for instance, it is stated by a high legal authority that - </para>

                    <para>Amongst the earliest examples given are the miners' societies. These societies provided for sickness, accidents, burials, and even granted pensions to. invalids, widows, and orphans. In the Han region these societies were numerous and flourishing, and amongst the mining ordinances which existed in Goslar from the year 1524 may be seen express provision for the granting of compensation for accidents and sickness. One of these ordinances quaintly provides that "he who breaks any member of the body so as seriously to interfere with his capacity for work shall receive from the common fund. an amount equal to eight weeks' wages, besides the free care of the physician." </para>
                    <para>To secure increase of both strength and unity in the working of these primitive societies, conferences were held, prior to 1600, between the representatives of the various bodies, and in this manner the regulations were simplified, and in certain cases the societies were united for their better working. It is interesting to note that no fundamental change in either rules or management occurred until during the last 50 years. </para>
                    <para>The independent initiative of the miners during all these years is most marked. To them alone belonged the entire administration, and it is not surprising that there was more of humanity than scientific skill displayed in their proceedings. The commonly announced principle was, "We give to the sick, injured, or needy a compensation according to his necessities, and according to the funds in hand." It would seem that the proceedings were conducted with fairness and mutual satisfaction, due largely no doubt to the fact that in these small associations a personal knowledge assisted to equitable distribution. </para>
                    <para>The funds were provided by contributions from the miners, each paying a percentage of his wages and a small weekly allowance. Owners and managers had to do only with the external regulations. No legal rights to compensation by them were admitted, but various small concessions were made by them, which tended to augment the funds of the societies, and these concessions have been somewhat extended during the present century. </para>
                    <para>One of the later and most important of the developments of the mining societies has been the administration by committees, consisting half of employers and half of employes, and the division of the contributions between both.

                    <para>It is a common assumption that socialistic legislation is in German politics of comparatively modern growth, and chiefly attributable to Prince Bismarck. As a fact, the famous Chancellor did but extend and develop the social system originated by the great Elector and by Frederick the Great. Under the latter monarch, State socialism first assumed a definite form in Prussian legislation. </para>
                    <para>The law in Prussia a century ago plainly laid down that : - " It is the duty of the State to provide for the sustenance of those of its citizens who cannot procure subsistence for themselves. "Work, adapted to their strength and capacities, shall be supplied to those who lack means and opportunity of earning a livelihood for themselves, and those dependent upon them. " Those who from laziness, love of idleness, or other irregular proclivities, do not choose to employ the means afforded them of earning a livelihood, shall be kept to useful work by compulsion and punishment under proper control. "The State is entitled, and is bound to take such measures as will prevent the destitution of its citizens and check excessive extravagance. "The police authority of every place must provide for all poor and destitute persons, whose subsistence cannot be insured in any other way." </para>

                    <para>We consider it our Imperial duty to impress on the Reichstag the necessity of furthering the welfare of the working people. We should review with increased satisfaction the manifold successes with which the Lord has blessed our reign, could we carry with us to the grave the consciousness of having given our country an additional and lasting assurance of internal peace, and the conviction that we have rendered the needy assistance to which they are justly entitled. Our efforts in this direction are certain of the approval of all the federate Governments, and We confidently rely on the support of the Reichstag, without distinction of parties.. In order to realize these views, a Bill for the Insurance of Workmen against industrial accident will first of all be laid before you, after which a supplementary measure will be submitted, providing for a general organization of industrial sick relief insurance. But, likewise, those who are disabled in consequence of old age or invalidity possess a well-founded claim to a more ample relief on the part of the State than they have hitherto enjoyed. To devise the fittest ways and means for making such provision, however difficult, is one of the highest obligations of every community, based on the moral foundations of Christianity. A more intimate connexion with the actual capabilities of the people, and a mode of turning these to account in corporate associations, under the patronage and with the aid of the State, will, we trust, develop a scheme, to solve which the State alone would prove unequal. </para>

                <para>Compulsory assurances against accidents arising in their trade or ' calling, at the cost of their employers, for all workmen and officials whose earnings do not exceed £100 per annum, in all industries under the provisions of the Employers Liability Act, and where operations are conducted by hand with the aid of machinery, and also in some branches of the building trade. There are regulations permitting the extension of the law to certain other specified persons. Contracting out of the Act is not permitted, and the renunciation of the claims of an insured person is stringently prohibited. The insurance is maintained under the guarantee of the Imperial (Federal) Government, and on the mutual system by trade associations, consisting of employers - united according to the different branches of industry - locally or throughout the Empire. These associations possess a legal status and full powers of self administration, subject, however, to the Imperial Insurance department. Compensation includes cost of cure, a fixed allowance after thirteen weeks from the date of accident while disabled, and in fatal cases, burial money, namely, twenty times the daily wages of the deceased, the minimum total £1 10s., and an allowance to the deceased's family as follows : - To the widow during widowhood or until death, one-fifth of the husband's earnings, and for every child fifteen one-hundredths of the earnings until the attainment of the age of fifteen ; but so that the combined annuities to any family shall not exceed three-fifths of the earnings of the deceased. During the first thirteen weeks after the occurrence of the accident, the person injured receives aid from the Sick Insurance funds, or the Trades Associations may, by agreement with the latter, undertake the charge of the injured during the said thirteen .weeks, and receive a refund of the expense from the Sick Insurance fund. A person totally disabled receives as compensation an allowance equal to two-thirds of his average yearly wage. If partially disabled, a proportionate allowance is paid ; or free hospital treatment, and an allowance for the family. </para>

If honorable senators will turn up the report, they will find a table setting forth the exact percentage of wages payable in respect of the loss of a finger, thumb, eye, limb, and so forth. There is a table, so that a worker knows precisely the proportion of his wages which he will be able to permanently draw as an annuity should he unhappily meet with accident.

                <para>Every employer contributes, therefore, in proportion to the risks to which he exposes his association. These risks for each separate establishment are determined by a distribution of the various occupations over the several classes of a danger-tariff, drawn up by the association, and in proportion to the amount of wages and salaries paid out. The law- confers on the association the important prerogative of prescribing regulations for the prevention of accidents. Through these regulations the employers can be compelled, under penalty of higher assessments, to adopt the necessary measures for safety, and also workmen may be forced by fines to follow these rules. </para>
                <para>The insured workmen are not members of the trade associations. They have, however, to bear a proportion of the aggregated liabilities caused by accident, as they, together with the employers, contribute to the sick relief clubs to which the care of patients is left during the first .13 weeks of the disability arising from an accident. But the statistical calculations show that the contributions of the workmen to the accident insurance are in an inverse ratio to the contributions of the employers to the sick relief insurance; while the workmen on their part bear only 11 per cent, of the entire burden for accidents, the employers have to contribute three times as much (33j per cent.) to the sick relief insurance. From these reciprocal relations it follows that there should be mutual participation in administration. Accordingly, the law permits representatives of the working men to take port in the investigation of accident cases, and in the discussion of preventive regulations, as well as in the proceedings of the Arbitration Courts and of the Imperial Insurance department. On all these occasions the workmen enjoy the same rights as the representatives of the employers. </para>

                <para>This extension to persons employed in the post and telegraph services, the railways and administrative departments of the army and navy is specially noteworthy inasmuch as it places the insurance so far as persons employed in Governmental institutions were concerned directly in the hands of the Empire or respective federal State without the intervention of trade associations. </para>
                <para>A further extension of the law took place, viz., on 15th March, 1886, by which provision was made for the insurance against actions of State officials and officers and men of the military forces. </para>
                <para>This Act, however, has more the character of pension than accident insurance legislation, since by it compensation for injuries is accorded in the form of a State pension, to all officials of the Empire. Several of the federal States have adopted similar legislation. The principal Acts of 1883 and 1884 did not include agricultural and forestry labourers in the scope of their operations, but on the 5th May, 188(&gt;, an extending Act made provision for their insurance against accident, and adopted certain regulations respecting their insurance against sickness. As regards accidents, insurance was, with some modifications, rendered necessary by reason of the special conditions of agriculture, made compulsory. </para>
                <para>In Germany small agriculturists frequently employ the members of their own families without wage contracts, and they (the small farmers) not infrequently become employes for limited periods. Another condition for which provision had to be made was payment in kind, which were and are still common in many parts of the Empire. Again, employers are often under the obligation of contract or custom to provide for agricultural labourers in the event of illness or accident. </para>

                        <para>- So that there can be no difficulty for the parliamentary draftsman, and no necessity for him to go outside the limits of this report to find every fraction of information available in Europe for the purpose of preparing a measure for this end of the world. Then in 1896 it was officially announced by the Imperial Insurance department that the law extending insurance would be shortly completed by its extension to the handicrafts and small trades, and to home industry and commerce, with about 1,000,000 establishments and 2,000,000 of employes, so that all workmen on wages, and other classes of similar standing, with not more than 2,000 marks, or about £100 a year income - such as agricultural and industrial managers, commercial clerks, and small employes - would reap the benefit of the Accident Insurance laws. Before I leave Germany I feel sure that it will be of interest if I give some details of the figures for the last year, which I was able to obtain from the German State statistics. The statistics were, of course, given in German money, but for easy perusal and understanding by English readers these were altered into English money. These figures can be found tit page 312 of the report, and I will only deal with those relating to accident insurance. In the year 1894 - that is, the tenth year of the operation of the initial law, but only a very few years, after some of the more recent extensions of the law had come into operation - the number of persons insured against accident, in Germany alone, was no less than 18,492,000. This number includes wage earners of all classes, and about 4,000,000 of small farmers, and many persons who tire insured under two different laws - finding employment under two methods of occupation, and, therefore, doubly insured. The persons relieved numbered 332,800. The total receipts, including the balance from the previous year, and fines and interest, were for the year £4,109,385. The employers' contribution to this sum amounted to no less than £3, 204, 1 50. It might be of interest, perhaps, for me to incidentally mention that the total payments by German employers in 1894 under the sickness, accident, and old-age and invalidity laws amounted to no less a sum than £7,500,000. That was the aggregate contribution of the employers of Germany under the State insurance laws. They paid £1,873,500 in respect to the sickness insurance laws, £3,204,150 in respect to the accident laws, and £2,500,000 under the invalidity and old age pension laws. </para>

                        <para>- I think that as I have given the contributions of the employers I should also give the contributions of the employed. Under the sickness insurance laws the employed paid £4,267,150, under the accident laws nothing, and under the old-age pensions and invalidity laws the same as the employers - £2,500,000. So that actually the employers paid altogether in round figures just about £1,000,000 more than the workmen. These figures, of course, relate to the whole system, but my speech is directed, practically, exclusively to the accident insurance question. I will leave the expenditure out, because as it is given it shows the year's addition to the fund, and that is not of much consequence to us. It is better that we should take notice of the cost of relief and administration. The cost of relief under the accident laws amounted to £2,214,085, and t]ie cost of administration to £472,000. The accumulated funds at the end of the year, in respect of accident insurance, amounted to £6,506,500. The relief given per individual case averaged £6 13s., and the cost of administration per person insured seemed to me to be extravagantly large, being no less than 3s. Old It is in this connexion that I entirely disagree with the system in vogue in Germany, of working the insurance through the employers' associations, whose methods appeared to be vastly extravagant - particularly on the part of the chimney sweeps, whose association was the most expensive of the lot. I strongly believe, as the result of the information I have obtained, and the knowledge I have gathered, in the transaction of such business as this directly with the State, as being by far the more economical proceeding. We thus have one management instead of thousands. </para>

                        <para>.- I think it was the same year. This fund is supported by deductions from the earnings of the miners and the owners, and by fines, donations, and bequests. It makes temporary allowances for slight injuries. But the real point with reference to Russia is that workmen permanently injured, and their widows in case of death, receive payment. The orphans likewise are pensioned by the proprietors of the mines. So that we find in Russia that for so many years back as I have indicated the injured workmen, the widows of the killed, and the orphans have been provided for at the expense of the mine-owners. This serves a very useful purpose. It is the same thing as employers paying money annually by way of insurance premiums, with this unhappy difference, perhaps, for the mine-owners - that in one case the liability is widely spread and known and recognised, while the payment is small, whereas in Russia, for example, the cost of these accidents falls, and must fall, upon the individual mines in which they occur. Switzerland is an object-lesson for Australia, especially as we find there a Constitution to which our own bears, perhaps, the closest resemblance. The various cantons have made numerous efforts to deal with this question. There has been for many years a profusion of voluntary associations in Switzerland, and we also find that the various cantonal Governments have made efforts so numerous with the same object in view that I would not take up the time of the Senate by describing them. All these efforts failed, and it became obligatory on the Federal Government to take up the matter. So pressing was the thing, so chronic was the hopelessness of voluntary effort in that country, that federated Switzerland had to alter its Constitution in order to legislate upon this most important question. Surely the fact that a people as frugal and industrious as the Swiss have found it necessary to take this great action should be an object-lesson not beneath the notice of the Senate, and all placed in authority throughout' the length and breadth of the land. At paragraphs 70S and 709 of my report the matter is referred to. The article of the Constitution as finally adopted by the Federal Chambers was made to read thus - "The Confederation is competent to introduce, by way of legislation, insurance against sickness and accidents, taking into account the Mutual Aid Societies already existing. It may declare participation in these insurances obligatory in general, or for certain determined categories of citizens." </para>

                        <para>- In 1890, when the revision took place, that does not appear to have been done. Six years elapsed after the amendment of the Constitution, and then a Bill was introduced largely following the German law, casting the whole cost upon employers, and conducting the business through an insurance bank or institution after the style of the Netherlands and Norway. The facts which I have quoted demonstrate clearly and emphatically that all civilized Europe is advancing rapidly towards State insurance in respect of industrial accidents, and that in a majority of the nations that result has already been achieved. And here it is interesting to note how great an influence in this matter has been exerted, not by socialists or even workers, but by one of the most irresponsible despots named in history. It is in the celebrated Code Napoleon that we find the modern origin of State insurance in regard to industrial accidents. We find one of the sources of its origin in the civil code and two in the penal code of France - the work of the great tyrant and the great butcher of humanity - showing that if he wrought evil in one direction he had at least some redeeming point in regard to the matters involved in the motion which I have put before the Senate.

                        <para>- Honorable senators are getting a few little pieces out of 600 pages. I want to say now that the logical outcome of these articles of the Code Napoleon was the enactment of employers' liability laws. That is why I have introduced the matter. I have traced the question of insurance from the earliest associations of the miners, 300 and 400 years ago, and have shown that the present legislation is due to the fact that it was found necessary that there should be something more than that. Napoleon seems to have been the first man to take action upon this, subject. </para>

                    <para>At various places in this report, I have freely acknowledged the unsuitability of compulsory old age insurance for Anglo-Saxon communities, but serious arguments can be advanced in favour of the application of this principle in regard to accident insurance of work-people by their employers, inasmuch as by the various Employers' Liabilities Acts in all parts of the British Empire, employers have been compulsorily constituted the insurers of their employes, to the extent, at least, of being liable to make good injuries arising from accidents which it was in their power to avert. </para>
                    <para>The burden of this responsibility is enlarged to the employer, while the measure of its protection for the worker is correspondingly reduced, by reason of the legal proceedings which these notoriously unsatisfactory laws encourage - litigation costly alike to the parties concerned and to the country ; injurious to the good relations which should exist between employer and employed, without which the industrial progress of a country cannot be satisfactory - litigation which practically destroys the beneficent ideal of Employers' Liability laws. </para>
                    <para>Viewed from this stand-point, it may well be considered whether the existing liability under these laws,, plus the legal costs of contested claims, do not reach a total charge upon employers equal to the contributions necessary to maintain a fairly complete and much more highly beneficial system of State insurance against accidents, the advantages of which, to the workers, would be incomparably greater than the uncertain and unsatisfactory relief granted them under existing legislation. </para>
                    <para>The question of State intervention resolves itself into one of State responsibility. In every civilized community the charge of the helpless - old, middle-aged, and young - is regarded as a proper function of Government, aud the higher the type of civilization developed, the greater the interest evidenced in the benevolence extended to those in need of help. This being acknowledged, there seems no valid reason why the State should not intervene, in certain cases, to prevent the occurrence of the distress it is willing to relieve. </para>

                    <para>COO. If now it is taken for granted, that provision ought to be made by the law to have workpeople insured against accidents met with 'in the performance of their work, then the question remains, whether it is sufficient to impose the obligation to insure, or whether the State must take the whole arrangement of the insurance into its own hands. For the reply to this question it is necessary to keep in mind the requirements, which an insurance, as here treated of, must fulfil. </para>

                <para>The partition of trades into risk classes must be done very strictly, so that a certain trade may not pay too much or too little, and within each risk-class each working concern must be estimated at a higher or lower percentage, according to the measures therein taken for the prevention of accidents. By a percentage estimate of the greatest possible strictness, the employer has thus an incentive to take as many precautionary measures against accidents as possible, for the lower the percentage allotted to certain works is, the less has to be paid for the insurance. If now in this classification and in this allotting of risk-percentages, the conscientiousness of private companies cannot be wholly depended upon, then the just-mentioned incentive for the employer is missing. Competition may likewise be the cause of companies officially maintaining their rates ; but in reality deviating therefrom by means of the risk-classification, and if State supervision has to step in here, the hampering and expensive effect thereof always remains an unmistakable impediment. </para>

                    <para>The able arguments of the Dutch Royal Commission's report, and those used in the massage of the Swiss Federal Council, inevitably lead to the conclusion that the State- cannot be satisfied with merely imposing upon employers the obli- . gation to insure their workpeople, but must of necessity' assume the duty of undertaking the entire management of the important work, and, undertaking this large responsibility, it must also guarantee the payment of the indemnity. Immediately the workers are insured by the State they will, us a necessary corollary, lose existing rights under the Employers' Liability Law. This amply proves the value of State insurance to employers, freeing them as it does, from all liability - except for criminal carelessness - for accidents of every kind, and instead thereof, placing them under a known annual charge, apportioned to the hazard of their enterprise, and the precautions taken by them to guard against accidents. Not only does it afford this large measure of relief to employers, but it frees them from the serious risk of speculative law suits, and absolutely limits to a previously ascertained amount the sum for which they are annually liable, and they are no longer, as at present, exposed to the risk of complete ruin by reason of specially serious accidents. To the employed, State insurance against accidents lifts the worker and his or her family out of the ditch of uncertainty on to the fair field of positive security against the risks that now surround them. Instead of having to accept such recompense as an employer may tender, or hazard all the casualties of protracted litigation, the worker enjoys the assurance of the State that in the event of accident he will certainly receive a substantial allowance throughout the period of his inability to labour all his life-long, or, in the event of his accident being fatal, that his wife and children will derive financial benefits sufficient to maintain them in a reasonable degree of comfort. </para>

                    . I tender to you "and the members of this Senate my profound thanks for the attention that has been extended to the remarks which I have had the honour to submit to my brother senators. If in bringing forward this matter, I have laid myself open to the charge of being a State socialist, I care not. If that which is good, if that which is valuable for the whole community be State socialism, then I give it my adhesion. But I am not among those who can be claimed to be rabid on any one point, so far as my knowledge extends. I took this matter up almost by accident in the first instance, and now I advocate it by conviction ; and I am one of those who, having put his hand to the plough, has no intention of looking back. If there is one man in Australia, more than another who is responsible for the introduction of old-age pension legislation within the limits of what now constitutes the Commonwealth, it is myself and the information which I collected upon the subject . is contained in this volume - a volume that is not made up of lengthy appendices- because there are only six pages of appendices in it - but a volume which gives evidence of large research and very wide knowledge attained. And as, happily, I have taken a large part in the introduction of the old age provisions which, however incomplete, still grace the statute-books of Victoria and New South Wales, I hope that the speech which honorable senators have listened to with so much patience, and so much courtesy, may be the first practical public effort of the Federal Legislature in inaugurating a system of beneficent care for the workers and beneficent protection for the employers - a system, sir, that will come as surely as the sun rises, and when it comes, it will be so much the better for the industrial concerns of the Commonwealth of Australia.

                        <para>- Yes. There is, as is well known to everybody, a broad distinction between insurances where the governing body guarantees the fund, and the regulation of insurance where private bodies guarantee the fund. Now, I think that the words in the section are intended clearly to draw that distinction. We, the Commonwealth, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of all private insuring bodies, but we have no right whatever to make any laws in reference to national insurance. That is what I take to be the meaning of the section, for this reason : the Commonwealth is made up of two branches - the States and the Central Government. The Central Government has no general jurisdiction over the people in the Commonwealth, but it is given a controlling and superintending jurisdiction over what the States do, and is also given a special original jurisdiction. I think this section does not confer upon the Federal Parliament an original jurisdiction to deal with the insuring of the four millions of .people resident in the Commonwealth, but it gives it a controlling and superintending jurisdiction over the" insurances that are lawfully effected outside the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It will be at once obvious that if we read " insurance " here to mean that we ourselves can become insurers, then we clothe ourselves with various social attributes that otherwise are not given to us, because you can make the effecting of insurance a portion of the industrial and social life of nearly everything in the Commonwealth. You can interfere with factory laws, you can interfere with mining laws, and with infants and various other matters that are really not intended to be controlled by the Central Government at all. Bearing out the truth of what I say, we find that where it was intended to give original and independent justification to the central Government to deal with these matters, the Constitution does so specifically. It says "old-age pensions." A system of old-age pensions is undoubtedly a system of insurance. </para>

                        <para>- Therefore I think we have to read it in this way : In the phrase "insurance other than State insurance," the word insurance is used in its generic sense of Government or national insurance. You contra-distinguish two things that are well known - insurances that are affected by private companies, and insurances where the governing body supplies the funds. </para>

The language of the Constitution was made terse for the purpose of defining the particular difficulties that are suggested to arise from short words being used. The intention of the Convention, as I respectfully suggest to the Senate, was that first of all the Parliament of the Commonwealth is to have a general control over all insurance laws. </para>

                        <para>- It can pass laws relating to insurance, subject to a limitation. That is the first proposition. The next point is - What are the limitations? " Other than State insurance." That means what it says - not a word more and not a word less. It means that if any State as a State passes any law relating to insurance that law shall be supreme within the State. </para>

The very condition of the Constitution is that so far as Government insurance is concerned, it is to be left to each particular State, and is never t'o be interfered with by the Commonwealth ; but where the State laws overlap , the laws of another State the Commonwealth Parliament may intervene. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to be distinctly understood. Insurance generally is under the Commonwealth. The Australian Mutual Provident Society, and every other society of the kind, is, therefore, under the Commonwealth. The only thing that is not under the Commonwealth1' is State insurance, which means Government insurance by the particular State. That is retained by each State, except to the extent to which in their legislation the States overlap and endeavour to carry out legislation beyond the limits of their jurisdiction. In this particular case, the motion is a general proposition that the Commonwealth shall undertake general Government insurance for the States. </para>

                        <para>- I think it means that. We are dealing with a great question of principle, and it is important to come to a sound decision about it. I take it that the motion is to ignore the States in regard to State insurance, and to' take away from any State the power of legislating in respect of Government insurance, handing this power over to the Commonwealth. </para>

It seems to- me that under that standing order before the report of the committee can be considered, or before any. decision can be come to by the Senate upon it, notice will have to be given of a specific motion. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out what the Bill tries to do. There is nothing new in this proposal. The whole tendency and course of legislation in all the States has been to give power to acquire land in this way. The honorable and learned senator says that he does not wish to interfere with the power of acquisition. But if this amendment is carried I am not at all sure whether it will not have that effect. I am not at all certain that the court might not rule that, as it was made the duty of the Government to serve these notices either personally- or by registered letter, such service is a condition precedent to the rights and powers given under the previous clauses. Whether this is so or not - because it is a point that can be remedied by an amendment - there is a serious objection to the proposal, even if it only deals with compensation. If there is one thing which it is essential to have settled with regard to the acquisition of land for public purposes it is that the country shall know what it has to pay, and that the costs shall be settled as soon as possible. We all know that one of the greatest difficulties in ascertaining what public works are to cost is in finding out what the land resumption is to cost. Public works are thus hampered and difficulties put in the way before the parties can be got together in order to agree upon the value of the property taken. If the amendment is adopted, it must necessarily lead to still greater difficulties. A provision of this kind is all very well in the English Act, but the circumstances are entirely different in Australia. We have large areas of land with a sparse and floating population. A man may occupy a lot in a town for five or six years, and he then may go away, no one knows where. It may be impossible to discover his whereabouts. He may die, and it may be impossible to find out who is interested in the land. In regard to country lands, it would be practically impossible to cany out the amendment serving any one, either by registered letter or by personal service. Then it is said, " You must make diligent inquiry." Is it not unsatisfactory to move an amendment in' that form ? What is the meaning of "diligent inquiry"? What is "diligent" in one case may not be in another. </para>

                        <para>- It will depend upon the interpretation the Judge puts on the words. All these difficulties will delay the settlement of the matter. Until the Government has served personal notice, or until diligent inquiry has been made, it would be impossible to bring to a head the claim for compensation. Then see what other difficulties it would lead to. . It is not only the personal owner who is affected. The people interested in the property are to be served, so that inquiries will have to be made as to who are the parties interested. This would mean making searches in all sorts of documents, which may not be easily accessible. All these inquiries would cause delay, and prevent a settlement of the question. What benefit would it all be to the person interested ? It has been determined that for the public good the land is to be taken. He cannot stop it being taken. All he has to do is to make his claim for compensation. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I know that my honorable and learned friend, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, 'will take any suggestion like this in good part. My only desire is to try and improve the Bill. I do not think I ought to withdraw the amendment in view of the information before me. I want honorable senators to understand the position. I entirely agree 'with what

                        <para>- The result is .the same. What the Minister really says is this: "I recognise that this thing is possible. I acknowledge that it is done in England, but I say that it ought not to be done here, for the reason that the Government is the party who is taking the land, and not a private individual." I think that is no reason at all. The Government, when it interferes with private property, whether for public purposes or hot, ought to be required to exercise the same precautions as we demand on the part of private individuals. It is said that in the colonial Acts, before federation, we always followed the course now proposed. That is not so. I find that the Victorian statute is based on the lines adopted in England.

                    (South Australia).' - I have been trying to find out what reason there is for departing from the old and usual custom of acquiring land .for public purposes, and I have failed to find out from the honorable and learned senator in charge of this Bill why the Government have done so. So far as South Australia is concerned, I have acted as chairman of a district council for many years, and have, in that capacity, had to put into operation the Act for making road deviations, &amp;c. In such cases we proceed in a -regular order, which is always followed when land is acquired for public purposes. In the first place we go upon the land and make a plan, showing exactly the property we desire to acquire for our purposes. We give notice to the owner, furnishing him with a copy of the plan referring- to his property. That is only right and just.

                        <para>- If the owner were dead he would probably have left a number of persons who would be interested in the property. It would be necessary to find his next of kin. All those inquiries would have to be made. When the persons interested were found, every one of them would have to be served. It is idle to say that all you have to show is that diligent inquiry has been made, and that if you cannot discover the persons by . diligent inquiry, you are relieved from serving them ; but that if you can discover them you are bound to do so. It will involve in every one of these cases an inquiry as to who are the persons interested. In many cases this inquiry would take up no time all, but in many other cases a great deal of delay may be caused. If by the word "owner" is meant simply the occupier of the land, is it fair to give the occupier an advantage in making his claim whilst you give the persons who have interests which may be equally great no opportunity of coming in to make their claims'? Prom the time the owner himself makes a claim there will be a number of persons interested. There is not only the original freehold owner but there are other persons. </para>

                    says the Government will take the land and substitute for it a certain amount of money, and that it will hold that money until the owner turns up. I think that principle is wrong. If you are taking 'a property from any one, it lies upon you to find out who ho is, and to find out to how much he is entitled. It is quite reversing the order of things to say that we will convert 1,000 broad acres into £5,000, and allow the money to remain in our hands till the owner comes up. I have been unable to see the difficulty pointed out by
                    I do not want to reiterate the argument, but what has been done since 1S45 in England cannot be too much to expect in Australia. We have our Torrens Act here, and in 99 cases out of 100 we can find out the owner of a piece of land by simply paying a visit to the Titles-office. It is not expecting too much to ask the Australian Government officials to pay a visit to one building, when the English people have to pay a visit to a hundred places perhaps, in order to find out the same thing.

                        <para>- It is quite right that it should be abandoned, because if we put it into the Bill, it would leave the way open to a great many claims being made by people who might say they were interested, and had not received notice. I do not think it would be a good thing to have notices posted upon the land. That practice has been- tried in Queensland, but no one takes any notice of it. </para>

                        <para>- There could be no objection to serving notice on the registered proprietor, provided it did not cause delay, because it is certainly desirable that we should know as early as possible how much is to be paid for the land to be acquired. It might be that the Government would propose to carry out certain public works, and that it would require to know what compensation it had to pay before proceeding in the matter. I have not heard any amendment yet which embodies the view that I understand some senators are in favour of adopting. </para>

If we use the words " registered proprietor, " we leave dealt with that considerable portion of land which is under the old system.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - We cannot very well satisfactorily settle amendments of this description in the midst of a discussion. Although we have been debating clause 6, the discussion has been upon a verbal amendment of clause 12. The better way, perhaps, would be for the House to resume, and between now and the next meeting of the Senate, the matter could be carefully considered with a view of arriving at a settlement. I am sure
                    will believe me when I say that there is no desire to throw any difficulty in the way of the Government as long as we hare fair play dealt out to the owners.

                        <para>-The Postmaster-General must be mistaken in saying that this proposal would delay the acquisition of land or the ascertainment of the compensation to be paid, because the land is acquired before the claim for compensation is put in. The land is acquired under clause 6, and the Commonwealth will determine to acquire it before publication is made, so that the giving of these notices does not interfere with the assessment of compensation by the Government according to their view of the matter. </para>
