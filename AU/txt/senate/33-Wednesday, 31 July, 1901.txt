                    <para>Honorable senators will see from clauses 16 to 19 the duties which are cast upon such persons. First of all, they are required to give security. Then a public accountant is not allowed to open any account at any bank except as authorized ' by the Treasurer, and no bank is to permit any public accountant to have an overdraft. But that provision is slightly qualified by a succeeding clause in the Bill which provides that in certain cases a bank credit may be allowed for certain purposes. Having dealt with the appointment of the Auditor-General and the inspection of accounts, it will be seen that the Bill resolves itself into two parts and deals with two subjects - the collection and the payment of moneys. It deals first cf n'l with the collection of public moneys. What is to be done with public moneys when they have been collected from the public ? The 20th clause provides that the Treasurer may make an arrangement with any bank - and of course that means with any bank or banks - for the " receipt, custody, payment,, and transmission of public moneys " ; with this proviso - that any agreement which may be made by the Treasurer with any bank is not to be made for a period of more than one year unless it' contains a provision - </para>

                            <para>- No; because by the interpretation clause it is made clear that the single includes the plural, and under that definition the word " bank " as here used will include any number of -banks. I may say that the Treasurer has stated publicly that he is negotiating or is about to negotiate with several of the banks,. in regard to arranging for the public account. It will be seen from the 23rd clause that the Treasurer or his deputy is to pay daily into the Commonwealth account " all moneys received." The public accountants are to pay from time to time all moneys they have in their hands into the public account. Every public accountant is also, by clause 24, to furnish to the Treasurer or his deputy a statement showing - </para>

                            <para>- It is practically a trust account, but the name given to it here is the money order account. That term is very well known, 1 think, in all the States. At the end of each month, or oftener if required, the postmaster is to pay into the public account all moneys so received as revenue. The 27th clause deals with the disposal of private moneys which have been collected under Acts of Parliament. That also is to be paid into a trust fund. Clause 28 relates to the receipt of money by public officers, which money comes to them "for or on account or for the use or benefit of any other person." The clause more particularly refers to the case of registrars of courts who receive money in respect of verdicts. In those cases the money is received for and on behalf of the person who is entitled under the verdict to it, and it would not be desirable that in that particular case the money should be at once paid into the consolidated revenue account. It is, therefore, kept as a separate account for a certain limited time, and the 29th clause provides that when any such money shall have remained in such bank for three months, the person who has received it shall pay the same or act in respect thereof and in regard thereto in like manner as public accountants are required to pay and act, with reference to moneys which shall come to their possession or control for or on account of die 'consolidated revenue fund. </para>

The remainder of the Bill deals with penalties, and there is the usual power to make regulations for carrying out its provisions. I do not think I need refer in detail to these clauses. The Bill has been carefully framed. We have had, of course, in this case the advantage of being able to compare the Audit Acts of all the States, and to consider the practice in all the States. I hope that when this Bill becomes law, it will be so clearly superior that it will be an encouragement to the States to alter their Audit Acts ; and to bring their practice into line with the practice of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Having neglected to take a copy of the Bill with me to South Australia last week, I have not had an opportunity of reading it with the care I should desire. I have only been able to glance through it to-day, but there are only one or two points in it that I think call for any criticism. The first is with regard to the audits. The method proposed is certainly different from the way in which we audit our accounts in South Australia. In South Australia, our accounts are audited by our Auditor-General after payment. This Bill provides that the accounts shall be audited before payment. That is a very marked difference, and the only criticism I can offer with regard to it is that while I can see certain advantages connected with it, 1 can also see certain disadvantages to the people to whom the State owes money. If they are to wait until the Auditor-General has audited the accounts there will be some delay, how much it is impossible to say now, in the payment of accounts. Another point in connexion with the Bill is with regard to the reports to Parliament. One of the most important functions which the Auditor-General has to perform is undoubtedly the presentation of his report to Parliament, and we have guarded that in South Australia with exceedingly great care. Not only do we provide, as is provided here, that the Auditor-General shall not be under the thumb of the Ministry, and that they shall not have the power of dismissing him at their own sweet will or pleasure - though, of course, they have the power to suspend him under circumstances similar to those mentioned in this Bill - but we take great care that his reports are made direct to the President and the Speaker, and that they are never seen by the Treasurer before they are handed to the heads of Parliament. Now, in looking at this-Bill as it is drawn, I notice that it is contemplated that the Auditor-General may not be able to bring up his report while Parliament is sitting. I contend that that is a contingency which should never arise, and under no circumstances should Parliament close the session before the Auditor-General's report is laid before it. The most important matter in connexion with the Auditor-General's report is that we should have it at the earliest possible moment after the meeting of Parliament, and after the close of the financial year, because he calls attention to matters relating to the public accounts which are of the greatest value to Parliament when considering the Estimates for the year. I do not like the provision in sub-clause (2), of clause 53, in which it is anticipated that there may be occasions on which the </para>

                    <para>In South Australia the results of this practice were not good. Parliament votes a sum for a certain service. Under that vote on one particular line there may be a surplus, and on another line in some other department there may be a credit, but the Government take the credit balance and apply it to wipe off a deficiency on the other line. It is -an exceedingly objectionable practice. We have put a stop to it in our State- for many years by insisting that the Treasurer shall bring down each year every surplus which has been made during the year, and show it as an una ppr or jr i a ted balance to credit ; and on the other hand, that he shall show wherever he has made an excess on every line, : -no matter how small it is - even if it is only- a shilling. If he has made -an excess on a- line voted by Parliament, he has to show on another paper what the excess on i the vote for the. year has been. </para>

                    <para>SenatorPLAYFORD.- It says it shall be brought before Parliament, but it is a great mistake to do it a tull. It is a great deal better to bring- it before Parliament in the way in which we do in South Australia. Clause 57 'also calls for a-word of comment. It provides -for -what we call suspense- accounts. At times suspense accounts are very 'necessary and wea-eally cannot do without them, but they . are filways&gt;]iable to a very considerable amount of abuse. 'In cur State we "have- had suspense . accounts- which have run on for years and years before they have been properly debited,, and the Auditor-General has constantly complained - of the . fact that Ministers have-beemdn the- habit of ' too frequently making -suspense accounts and then neglecting to properly apportion, the line to which the- amount was1 to-be- debited. I notice:that- this clause only applies to the loan fund. So far as I can - see,- if it is carefully watcher! by the . Treasurer and the Auditor General it can do no harm. -At the same time, it- is one- of those points which have1 to be watched with very great care, else very great abuses will creep -in. Take the way in which these accounts- work in regard to the ordinary revenue. Parliament appropriates a -sum- out of' the ordinary "revenue for the purpose of -planting a i forest -reserve, and the Treasurer- says " L do' not know exactly what line ; fc&gt;' -put that- under. 1 shall put it into a.suspenseiaccount." The nuisance of the practice is . that it -does -not appear- in the year's transactions, with the- result. that, by means of a suspense- account, he ; may -sometimes be able to - balance the year's -accounts and shew a surplus, which otherwise he would not be- able to do. I do not know that there is . any other clause which I meed touch upon. "Proni. a cursory examination -the Bill . appears to he very carefully drawn. Ii am not in favour of the parsimonious payment of -any officer. I look upon the Auditor-General, however, as one of the most important officers in 'the Commonwealth. . It is . absolutely necessary that we should have a "thoroughly reliable, upright, intelligent man, and it appears to . me that for. £1,000 a year we -shall not be able to get that man.

                    <para>Upon the table of Parliament an order, so to speak, authorising an operation of this kind, it may be assumed that unless there is in the Parliament some Hume - the same kind of man ' as there was nearly 100 years ago in the British House of Commons - the item will be passed by without getting the incidental or implied authority of Parliament. That system leads to many abuses and vicious practices. Therefore, I hope this clause will be struck out. There is a very ready executive method by which the same operation can be done, whilst at the same time expressly directing the attention of Parliament to it, and inviting the approval of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- In each case, decidedly. Suppose there is a sum of £50 wanted for a particular public work. The Executive will, in the ordinary constitutional way, spend the £50. They will bring the matter down to Parliament in the ordinary way, showing the excess on the vote, and then they will expressly ask the authority of Parliament to each of the items of surplus expenditure. But by this clause the Government specifically provides for expenditure at the will of Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- That is the Executive. The Executive provides the money without the authority of Parliament, and simply notifies it to Parliament by laying a paper on the table. The difference is that in the one case the Government has to take the risk of asking parliamentary authority to their act, and in the other case the Governor General absolutely provides the money, and then the risk the Government takes is merely to lay the paper upon the table of Parliament, when, unless some very curious member discovers the paper by taking it out from amongst all the other papers that may be laid on the table, no more is heard of it. This would be what I have called a prophetic expenditure of money; it is putting the cart before the horse, to use a common expression. If the Minister considers it rom the point of view to which attention has been directed to-day, he will see the importance of adhering to the well known constitutional practice of asking parliamentary authority to any expenditure that may have been deemed necessary or may have been made. The importance of that, and of putting a stop to all unauthorized expenditure, has been exemplified by a matter to which attention has been called in another place. That is as to allowances having been made to officers in addition to their salaries, and without parliamentary sanction. No more objectionable system can possibly be introduced ; and if we can under this Bill do anything to signify our disapproval of a course of that kind we ought to do it. It is this kind of unauthorized expenditure which is so very ready to creep in where any Government does not feel itself bound by those rigid rules which should be followed in regard to the expenditure of public money. . </para>

                            <para>- Under the control of a joint House Committee. If there is a deficiency, as unhappily I believe there may be, it is met out of the Treasury. It is, therefore, quite clear that if the Treasury meets the loss, it would also retain any profit that might arise. It is obvious that, under the definition in the clause I have just mentioned, these moneys would come under the category of public moneys, and would be subject to the whole scheme of audit laid down by the Bill. I am quite sure that is not intended, because if it were it would necessitate the existing management having a staff' of clerks in order to keep accounts and details in connexion with the catering. It would be necessary to have a full system of books and so on, which might be very expensive. What I suggest is, as a method to prevent anything of that kind, that in the definition of public moneys we shall make the paragraph read - </para>

                        (Queensland).' - I regret that, in consequence of my absence from; the State 'during the last fortnight, I have not .been able to read this Bill very carefully. . I- have. : merely &gt; glanced . oven it during the Postmaster-General's explaination. I have, listened, with much attention and- a. great, dealt of . interest and profit, to the speech delivered-, bv
                        who has had. some expedience in South Australia in the handling- of . State finances,, and in the discharge- of, duties- relating!  to other  responsible' posi-tions.  He  has watched  with a great deal of . care and i concern the finances- of that State; and, I think his- contribution &gt; to the debate is a very valuable  one:  In my; opinion, the- matter is- most important., The position of ..the Auditor-General will be one of great trust-  and  responsibility, and. I think it ought ;to be filled by the. most competent man that- we can .obtain. I join with other honorable, senators- in saying that,, although I . have advocated rigorous economy, in i this- case I think-, that, economy . and i efficiency .must be combined. . While we should obtain efficiency at the most reasonable cost, I do not think, that, £1; 000 per annum  will be  sufficient for this, office. I certainly do share the opinions .expressed  by  some honorable senators that such ,a salary is not' sufficient to-  command  the services of the best man obtainable for this . most important office.- In the- State* for. which 1 1 have the honour to. be one- of 'the.representatives, wa have- a . very- excellent man i. as Auditor General. . That. gentleman has filled the position for &gt; years, with, great  credit to  himself .' He  has given  unbounded  satisfac-tion,  and mas. the confidence of Parliament and the. people. On-two On three" occasions we have had some rather' serious crises in our financial affairs,- and, the AuditorvGene- - l-al of Queensland has. not. failed to. point out' the delinquencies and deficiencies of those concerned. As. a member of. the committee , of investigation which, -was. appointed, to- inquire into i the affairs of. the Queensland National. Bank,., he.- gave his times and attention, to the. work after dealing with his own duties ; and Parliament not only allowed him. his salary, of £1,000 a year, but i paid him a handsome, sum. for the. special services which i. he rendered.. . to . the State on: that, inquiry. This is some indication-, that the people- and. the Parliament. . of. Queensland have recognised, that gentleman's ability, and have treated him in a liberal rand 'reasonable- way. J do not think that £1,000 a year, is sufti- - cient to . command ; -the services of the best man for the office of Auditor-General for . the' Commonwealth. Could, any one . say. that' in i auditing the. whole of the- accounts! of the six. States, in attending toi the division . of. the. funds-: - portion, -of which goes to the States-mombh by month and portion to the. Commonwealth in order to . enable the -Government of . the Commonwealth, to. carry on - a. man. of- ordinary ability should be employed? He will -be called. upon to discharge multifarious duties, and I certainly join with other, honorable senators in. recommending the Postmaster-General, and -through him.-the Government; to consider the desirability of increasing this salary.

                            <para>- I do not think horses and guns would come under the same subdivision, but we can discuss the matter further in committee. With regard to clause 56, the clause dealing with interest, if we were to alter that clause, and provide that in future interest must always be debited to the quarter during which it accrued, the result would perhaps be a disinclination on the part of some of the States to transfer any part of their public debt on that account. It might be calculated to act as a deterrent in that way. If we altered our Audit Act in the way suggested as soon as we took over a portion of the debt from some one of the States where the other practice has been followed, we should have at once to debit that State with interest which they had been accustomed to defer to a future period. Supposing they pay their interest half-yearly, they have been in the habit of paying their interest on the 1st July, and debiting it to the second half of the year. One of the conditions of taking over their loan, assuming that the suggestion made "were adopted, would be that the interest that in the State has been debited to the second half of the year would have to be debited to the first half of the year. </para>

                            <para>- It is only a day or two's difference. The interest really should be paid on the 30th June, but the State does not do it. The 30thJune is the last day of their financial year, and the 1st July is the first day of the next financial year, and though they show a nice surplus, it is taken away when they pay their interest on the 1st of July. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit that. We say now that we are adopting a better principle than some of the States have adopted in the past,- but that better principle if made applicable to loans taken over would mean that the interest would have to be debited to an earlier period than it has been hitherto in the wise of some of the States. The condition upon which we can take over a portion of the debt from one of the erring States, would be that when we took over their debt, we would debit them with the interest six months earlier than they had been accustomed to debit themselves with it, and it would consequently make their balance look so much worse However, the matter is one we can well discuss in committee. </para>

The honorable and learned senator will see that the " public accountant" under the Bill is a person who actually receives or disburses any "public moneys," so that if the honorable and learned senator excludes these moneys from the definition of "public moneys" the amendment he now proposes will not be required. With regard to the other amendment, I should like to hear some other opinions upon it. I agree that it is not desirable that these accounts should be subject to audit. </para>

It will lie very easy, if he thinks any amendment is necessary, to recommit the clause.

                        <para>- It is trust moneys, but they are continually receiving money and paying it out. Clause 26 provides that the Postmaster-General may pay these amounts which he receives into a bank. He draws cheques, and at the end of each month pays the amount into the Commonwealth public account. The only difference is that the ordinary public accountant has to pay in moneys as he receives them. In the case of the Post-office the Minister pays them into the public account at the end of the month and draws cheques in the meantime against the money order account to pay money orders which may be presented. I think it will be as well to allow the clause to go now, and then I shall find out exactly how the Victorian Act is worded. If 1 find the wording of the definition in the Act is the same as the wording of this definition, or if I find, having considered the matter carefully, that this definition will not make that particular money public money, I think no danger is likely to arise. </para>

                        <para>- The question ought never by any possibility to arise. The caterer takes his responsibilities, names his rates, which are agreed to by the House Committee, and the thing works itself. But to provide absolutely in a solemn Audit Bill, for an audit of this expenditure which must occur in public affairs appears to me to be beyond all reason. When we put on the Estimates a sum for the purpose of supplying members with refreshments, then I think will come, incidentally and properly, a corresponding obligation on the part of the Audit department to see that these matters are properly dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- The rest is a matter of detail for the House Committee to arrange. Even supposing that the direct words of the clause might allow an inquiry which might be invidious and uncomfortable to be made in respect to expenditure, we had better let them stand as they are rather than put in words of qualification or exception, which would lead to greater difficulties. I think the clause needs no amendment. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - The last speaker's conclusion may be very good, but certainly his reasons are the very opposite of those which he ought to have given. In the first place he has done an injustice to everybody concerned in this matter,
                    suggesting that they wish to avoid some invidious and unpleasant examination of accounts. That has not been suggested here this afternoon. On the contrary, it has been agreed that there should be an audit of these accounts, but that it should be under the direction of the House Committee, whose function it is to deal with this matter. The honorable and learned member has entirely misapprehended the facts. It so happens that he has assumed that there is a parliamentary caterer. If there was a parliamen arp caterer, this point would not arise. It is because this thing is managed b}' the House Committee, which represents for this purpose the Commonwealth, that this difficulty arises, and because these moneys may possibly come within the definition of public moneys. We desire that the point shall be made clear. The honorable and learned senator admits that if an amount were voted on the Estimates for these purposes, it would be all right - that we could discuss this question. That, as
                    Baker says, is the exact position. However, I am willing to withdraw the amendment, and the Minister can then see if the language of the provision of the Victorian Act is the same as the language of this clause.

                        <para>- Yes, but it must be remembered that we do not always pay salaries in proportion to the importance of the duties discharged, or else Members of Parliament would be more highly re- 'munerated. If we say that £1,000 a year is not sufficient for the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth at this stage of our history, I expect that when we come to consider the question of salaries of Members of Parliament it will be said - and I shall certainly agree with it - that £400 is an exceedingly small salary to give a man of business to pay his expenses in attending Parliament thousands of miles away from his home. </para>

                        <para>- I am quoting it as an illustration, because my opinion is that there are in the Commonwealth some men of the requisite ability who would be prepared, for the sake of the honour and dignity and usefulness of the position, to serve the Commonwealth as Auditor-General for this salary. I quite admit that if some gentleman who is doing similar work in a leading financial institution for very much more money than £1,000 a year were to be invited to fill this post, we could not expect him to fill it for £1,000 a year. But that cannot be made the test and the standard. If we want a man of great ability, we cannot offer him a- position and pay him a salary which we think represents what he would make in some other walk of life. It is not possible to do that. A man of the necessary ability who would be able to make £2,000 or £3,000 a year by acting as manager of a bank, or of some great financial corporation, probably could not be induced to give up his position and accept the post of Auditor-General at £1,000 a year, nor could we tempt him by offering him the same salary as he is receiving. If we followed that practice in all other positions in the service, it can be seen that the expenditure, which has been referred to very pointedly lately, would be considerably increased. I do not wish to labour the matter, because I am always in favour of paying a fair salary myself. But it is a matter for the State to decide whether £1,000 a year is sufficient in this case. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I also join with
                    in asking
                    to temporarily withdraw his amendment, and in urging the Minister in charge of the Bill to postpone this clause. I do so for two reasons. One is that it has been put very impressively by
                    that it might be very unwise for us as a Senate to interfere with the decision of the Government in fixing the salary which they desire to appropriate for this officer. Certainly the reasons given by
                    have impressed me very much. The salary is not quite what I should have liked it to be. At the same time, there is very great force in the argument that the Government are cognisant of the duties which they require this officer to discharge. They may have an officer in view who would be thoroughly competent to discharge those duties, and to whom £1,000 a year would be adequate remuneration. At any rate they have introduced a salary into the Bill, which has had the sanction of the other House, and which has come down to us under circumstances which should make us pause - I say so freely even after the expression which I used earlier in the evening - before we increase the amount. A more important matter is the Constitutional question which has been raised. First of all the question is whether this clause should appear in the Bill at all, or whether it should be introduced in a separate- measure. Then we have to consider whether being in the Bill it is open to be amended in the ordinary way in which we would amend any other clause, or whether we should adopt the course of suggestion. I do not agree with
                    in thinking that section 54 of the Constitution Act deals with the subject. The view which
                    Baker has stated on the subject concurs with what I feel should be the construction of that section. It is a limitation of the powers of the House of Representatives in regard to the subject-matter of a proposed law to appropriate revenue or moneys. It is a limitation imposed upon them which they are unable to transgress under the Constitution. It has no relation to a Bill which may deal with, postal or other matters, but which incidentally contains a provision appropriating revenue or moneys. As to the operation of clause 53, I am equally unable to concur in the view that it is limited to laws designedly intended to appropriate revenue or moneys. It appears to me that the clause with which we are dealing is a provision which does appropriate revenue or moneys. If if ended at the figures £1,000, it would have fixed the salary and done no more. But it goes on to appropriate that salary, and to make it a charge upon the consolidated fund. It provides that-
                </para>
                <para>Such salary shall be a charge upon and paid out of the consolidated revenue fund, which to the necessary extent is hereby appropriated accordingly. </para>

I am not going to contend now, however, that we ought to be placed in that position, but there is this fact that if it is an appropriation of public moneys, as it undoubtedly is, it should have originated in the other House by means of a message from the Governor-General recommending the proposed appropriation.

                    DOWNER (South Australia). - I agree in asking the Postmaster-General to postpone this clause, but in doing so 1 wish to say two or three words on the question of whether the amount of the salary proposed could be increased and on the constitutional point which has been raised. As to the question of increasing the amount, one feels impressed with what
                    has said, that the responsibility in all ordinary matters of the Governmental service should be left to the Government. They should bear the brunt of them. They ought to "know best what is to be recommended, and they ought to be able to tell us best. We should, unless there are some strong reasons to the contrary, act on their advice, and if the advice 'turns out to be wrong, they should bear the responsibility. But allow me to say at the same time that the position of the Auditor-General is not in that ordinary category at all ; he is an officer who stands between the House and the Government. He is our protection against Government aggression, and if we place him in a lower position and the result is that either from too low a salary or from having too indifferent a man appointed, the Government accounts, which should be independently audited as between ns and the Government, and not audited simply by the Government themselves - go wrong, we shall be to blame even to a greater «x.tent than the Government. The Auditor-General is not imposed by the Government, but by us, and he should therefore be an officer of high character and high position, removed from all chance of prejudice, corruption, and everything else of the kind, and paid in a manner which will add to that reputation. J entirely agree, therefore, with
                    that the salary should be increased. In the matter of the next question, as to whether we can amend so as to increase the salary, that is a constitutional question, and though I join in asking the Minister to postpone the clause, I am strongly of the opinion that it is strictly within our constitutional powers.

                        <para>- I am taking one thing at a time. It was that we should not amend the Appropriation- Bill, the Bill which recommended the ordinary appropriation for the year, or taxation Bills, but, whilst we agreed to that, we had it perfectly in our hands .-ill through, and I think we put it into very clear phraseology in the Constitution that where Bills are not introduced for appropriating revenue or imposing taxation, and where for the mere purpose of carrying out the provisions of the proposed law, officers were required and fees had to be paid - and we may call them fees or salaries as it is merely quibbling with terms ; I want honorable senators to remember that I am fighting for our rights now - we were not to lose our rights to amend simply because incidently upon the major matter or substance of the Bill we provided as of necessity for officers to administer the Bill and fees to be paid in respect of that administration which they of necessity have to carry out. That was the intention. The word salaries was not used, but the word fees covers that as a matter of course. The intention of the Constitution was that whilst we had no right to make any amendment in the Appropriation Bill, yet where a Bill came to us in which it was not sought to appropriate revenue at all, but which necessarily involved expenditure, we should be able to make any amendment in such a Bill we pleased, notwithstanding that it involved the necessity of the payment of fees. We were not to be deprived of our right, excepting in the one' case which we had some great fights about. We were not to be deprived of our right to amend any Bill excepting the ordinary Appropriation Bill and Bills which imposed taxation. I say so far as this Bill is concerned its primary object is not to impose taxation. It does not impose taxation. Its primary object is not to invade on the revenue in any shape or form. Its object is entirely departmental - to insure order and good government - and incidentally to that there is to be, as there will have to be in every Bill of the kind, the creation of officers and the payment of fees. I care not whether we call these fees or salaries or anything else. I say the words of our Constitution are broad enough to bring it within our ambit, and give us the fullest right to interfere by amendment, and not only by suggestion. Probably it comes to very much the same thing whether we do it in one way or the other, but remembering the history of the Constitution, and the fights we had over it, I would ask the Senate to adhere to the position that our power to amend is only limited to the ordinary Appropriation Bill and Bills imposing taxation. </para>

                        <para>- I do nob think that applies. We are going to adjourn this matter, and I am only mentioning the views that occurred to me that my honorable friends may give them such/ consideration as they think they deserve. These are very strict words, undoubtedly, but they have no reference to a proposal of this description. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, unless they get a further message from the Crown. We all want to preserve our rights. We do not want to increase them or to lose them. .What I suggest for the consideration of honorable senators is, that whilst we cannot amend an Appropriation Bill or a taxation Bill, when any Bills come down for a purpose other than appropriation or taxation, but which of necessity in their machinery involve expenditure, we have a right to amend and deal with them in any way we please. That is my proposition, and whilst entirely agreeing with, the suggestion that this clause should be further considered, I submit these considerations for honorable senators to think over in the meantime. </para>

                        <para>- I understood that it was his contention. If we can amend the most infinitesimal part ot the Bill, it is a proposed law which we can amend. Consequently, if it contains a clause which in our opinion we have no power to amend, clearly the proposed law is one in which wecann.ot effect an amendment, therefore it is one which we can only return to the lower House with certain suggestions. It is unfortunate, but I certainly think that is the correct reading of the section. </para>

                        <para>- lt does, and we are so landed for this reason. I think the House of Representatives was perfectly right in putting in a clause, in which it said it appropriated £1,000 for a purpose. By putting in that clause, that House made the Bill, if not an Appropriation. Bill, at all events a Bill dealing with the appropriation of moneys. We find that the moneys in question do not answer the description of fees, licences, or services in the qualifying portion of section 53 of the Constitution. We therefore look to another paragraph of that section, which refers to any such Bill as we cannot amend - not any clause of a Bill. This Bill contains an objectionable feature, and this Bill we cannot amend. Our only power, therefore, in reference to every part of the Audit Bill is, I think, to suggest amendments. </para>

                    (New South. Wales). - lt appears to me, that if we follow the interpretation suggested by the last speaker, we shall find ourselves landed in a very absurd position. We shall find ourselves in the position of having placed before us a machinery Bill which mentions, and appropriates the salary to be paid to the chief officer under it, and which we are utterly powerless to amend. Our only course with regard to such a Bill would be either to reject it on the second reading, or to get rid of it in some way or other, in order that the other House might submit two Bills to us, one fixing the salary, and the other dealing with the appropriation of the revenue. No doubt that would get us over the difficulty, but is there power for such a course to be taken ? 1 do not think there is under the Constitution Act. Although this Bill provides money for one of the salaries to be paid, I do not take it to be -a Bill which comes under the ordinary category of Bills- appropriating money or revenue which could not originate in the Senate, and as a Bill which we have no power, to amend. The section clearly contemplates a Bill dealing primarily and chiefly with the appropriation of revenue, and not a Bill which deals only incidentally with such appropriation. The difficulty with regard to the clause simply arises under the 53rd section, which provides that the Senate -

                        <para>.- I think not; there is a wide distinction. Consequently the argument which the honorable and learned senator put forward on this occasion is entirely beside the question. It does seem to me that this insertion of an appropriation clause in an ordinary Bill, which otherwise we should be competent to handle in any way we thought fit, places a limitation on the powers of the Senate. It is a matter of great importance to us, because there is no limit to a leak in a dyke of this kind. Bill after Bill may be sent here, containing clauses appropriating money here and there and we may find ourselves in conflict with the other House in consequence of the undesirable insertion of an appropriation clause in a plain machinery Bill. I think the practice is most undesirable. If this sort of thing is ' allowed it will inevitably lead to conflict between the two Houses sooner or later ; to collisions which would be most happily averted by keeping an appropriation distinct from a machinery measure. What is there, for instance, to prevent a Bill to regulate the Customs coming up to us with an appropriation clause in it. We might find ourselves at every turn brought up by this question of appropriation. I venture to think, as the Postmaster-General has been courteous enough to express his willingness to postpone this clause, that he will see that it is in the interests of the satisfactory transaction of business between the two Chambers that this appropriation of moneys shall be put in that separate Bill. I take it that there would be no difficulty in passing it in that form and it would happily avoid the absolute certainty of future conflict between the two Houses if matters of mere machinery are mixed up with appropriations. </para>

I rose hastily, and I did confuse "origination" with "amendment." Now, when I read section 53 carefully, I have not the slightest difficulty in understanding it, nor have I the slightest difficulty in saying that this is a clause which we may amend.. Section 53 of the Constitution Act deals with initiation and initiation only.

                        <para>- Yes ; it is as if a. bank had a revenue of £20,000 a year. The directors of that bank may pass resolutions raising one man's salary, lowering anotherman's salary, and dealing with the revenue in various ways, but never wanting more than the £20,000. This section clearly has. reference ,to Parliament dealing with the- revenue which has been obtained from the people. If we cannot deal with that revenue without putting an additional burden upon the people, then when a Bill comes before us which has that additional burden on the people suggested and brought about by the necessity for this change we cannot amend it. I must say I feel I was very wrong in expressing my opinion without having thought it out. The section now reads, to me exceedingly plain. We cannot originate a Bill of this kind. I think the House of Representatives must originate all these Bills of the department over which their origination goes. When such a Bill reaches us we must consider how we are to deal with it. One class of Bills in that department we can deal with by suggestion, and another class we can deal with by amendment, although we cannot originate. Of the Bills that come down to this Senate, those that propose new taxation and impose a new burden on the people must be dealt with by suggestion ; but in regard to all other appropriation Bills, which do not fall within paragraphs 2 and 3 of section 53, the mere fact that they are Appropriation Bills does not preclude our power of amendment. My conclusion is that the Audit Bill, as now before us, does not deal with ordinary revenue. It does not impose a new burden on the people. It does appropriate revenue, lt is, however, an Appropriation Bill outside the exceptions, and therefore an Appropriation Bill which we can amend. </para>

                        BAKER (South Australia). - I am afraid that
                        has mixed up two very different things - the question of the imposition of taxation upon the people, and the appropriation of the revenue. In theory the revenue is the revenue of the Crown, and the parliamentary appropriation is a modern innovation. Not so very long ago in the' history of England the Crown appropriated the revenue, raised by burthens and charges placed upon the people, as it liked without any interference whatever by Parliament. The Crown got into difficulties sometimes, and Parliament helped it out of those difficulties. Parliament said - " Well, if you cannot live within your income we will help' you out of these difficulties on this arrangement, namely, that in future wo will appropriate the revenue to specific purposes, but we will not take the whole control of the revenue within our hands. We will not appropriate any revenue unless you, by message from the Crown, recommend its appropriation." It is from that state of tilings that there has arisen the modern parliamentary practice that the Legislature cannot increase an appropriation of the revenue recommended by the Crown, but it can decrease it. It is possible that we cannot make this" increase without a message from the Crown, but that is a different question altogether. That is a question only incidentally referred to, but the reason we cannot increase has nothing to do with the fact that it is a burthen upon the people. It arises from the state of affairs to which I have referred, and from the fact that the revenue is theoretically the revenue of the Crown, and cannot be appropriated unless by message from the Crown. Whether we can get that message or can not get it, and whether it is necessary or not necessary, are matters which I do not want to enter into. I only rose to point out that
                        gave reasons which appear to me altogether inappropriate, and put it to the Senate that we could not increase an amount placed upon the Estimates, because it might increase the burthen upon the people. The reason we cannot increase it is because we have not got a proper message from the Crown to do it.

                        <para>- I suppose it is only proper that we should. According to this section we cannot deal with anything else in a Bill which appropriates money. This Bill not only appropriates money, but creates the office of Audit-General and provides the machinery for carrying on his office. It appears to me to combine two things. What the Government ought to have done was to introduce a Bill creating the office of Audit-General and fixing the salary, and another Bill to appropriate £1,000 per annum for the office. I do not know what the Minister proposes to do. He said that we must stick to the Constitution. If that is so, the Bill proposes to do something which the Constitution does not allow it to do. It is introduced in violation of a provision of the Constitution, and that being so, I think it ought to be withdrawn. I do not know whether a message has been sent down. </para>

                        <para>- I quite disagree with the honorable senator on that point. I think it is an Appropriation Bill so far as that clause is concerned which the Senate may amend, but the question is whether if we amend it in the direction of increasing that amount we are not increasing the burden or charge on the people, and consequently doing something contrary to the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. This is my Opinion at the present time, and I think it is desirable that the matter shall be very carefully considered before we decide* what action we shall take. </para>

We are told that the great Commonwealth finances, and all that sort of tiling, will have to be looked after. The great Commonwealth finances will be no' greater than the finances of some of the States, seeing that a number of services are not taken over to make them greater. In some of the States the revenue of the Railway department is almost as great as half of the finances which have to be dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- That does not matter. I am only talking of the importance of what is to be looked after under the Commonwealth in comparison with the States. It will be time enough to magnify the office when the importance of the services taken over in comparison with the States warrants it. Those are the reasons why I am against the increase. I have no intention of going into the constitutional question, because it would probably occupy a consider-' able length of time to do so ; but from my reading of the Convention debates, the members of the Convention were very particular to specify what they had done much more clearly than is the case in any of the Constitutions of the States. As to the practice of the House of Commons, that has grown up in the course of years, and if we want to make precedents for ourselves we shall have to begin now. I have no doubt that there are plenty of federal legislators who would like to curtail the powers of the Senate. as much as possible, but I am surprised at honorable senators who are always- talking about the dignity and power of the Senate, hesitating to take those powers to themselves when they have the opportunity. This is the opportunity ; miss it, and we may never have the chance again. </para>

                        <para>- I should think three months would be sufficient, especially as the next clause provides that the person who is entitled to the money may make a claim at any time, even after six months. We have two considerations at work. One is to make it as convenient as possible to persons entitled to the money to get it. We want the officer to hold that money in his hands a sufficient time in order that he may pay it with all . possible expedition to the person who is entitled to it. On the other hand, we want to avoid leaving it in the hands of officers for an unduly long time. The Treasurer thinks three months a fair time. </para>

Does the Minister think it convenient that there should be a time limit as to when claims may be established to the satisfaction of the Governor-General. No suclr'Sitoit is fixed at present. It is very indefinite. A sum of money may be disputed after all the witnesses who may be able to throw any light on the case are dead.

                    <para>- This was the clause upon which a good deal was said in the debate on the second reading. I would like to say, in order that there may be no misapprehension, that it only refers really to small sums comprised in subdivisions of annual supplies, and then it is only a limited amount that can be transferred in this way. Honorable senators will see that power is given to Parliament to declare certain subdivisions unalterable, and where that is done it will, prevent this clause having any operation at all. But, in practice, a provision of this kind has been found very .useful, especially' towards the close of the financial year, when all the votes are running out. It is impossible, twelve months beforehand, to exactly tell how much will be required in the different subdivisions in the Estimates, and it must very often happen that the amount required in some item of a subdivision has been underestimated. In the past Ministers have had, by means of an Order in Council, to transfer some portion of one vote in aid of another vote in order to eke out an amount that has fallen short, until the passing of the next Appropriation Bill. This enables a Minister in many cases to carry on his department in a proper manner without spending money in anticipation of the sanction of Parliament. I am afraid that without some provision of the kind, it will be found impossible sometimes to carry on the department without sanctioning the expenditure of money in anticipation of a vote of Parliament. It is only with respect to small amounts, and honorable senators will see that it is quite sufficiently safeguarded under sub-clauses (2) and (3). I have dealt with the matter at greater length now than I should otherwise have done, as I think that in moving the second reading of the Bill I inadvertently referred to this clause giving to the Treasurer greater powers than it really does. </para>

                        <para>-v-Undoubtedly. I took it upon myself, and Ministers took upon themselves the responsibility which properly belongs to Ministers, of paying any sum that might be absolutely necessary for carrying on the business df the country ; we then brought down a statement showing the items in connexion with which we took that responsibility, and asked Parliament by resolution to pass legally the necessary authority to cover the advances made by Ministers. That is a far more satisfactory way of doing business than is here proposed. Under this Bill, Ministers would never ask Parliament for the authority to spend the money. They would ask Parliament to spend money in a certain direction, and then take the money away from the vote to which Parliament appropriated it and apply it to some other line on the Estimates, and make up the deficiency. All that it would be necessary for them to do under this Bill would be to quietly lay before Parliament a statement that they had done this kind of thing, and they need never ask for parliamentary 'approval for the action taken. I contend that the proper course to adopt in this matter is the course adopted in the State of South Australia. We pass, in the first instance, an Appropriation Bill based upon certain Estimates. These estimates have numberless subdivisions, and cover the sums of money considered necessary for carrying on the business for twelve months. If the money voted is not required we bring down a statement to Parliament showing the savings that have been effected, and that . statement is laid upon the table. Then in cases where the appropriation has not been sufficient to cover the necessary expenditure for the year, the Government in the first place pass through the Cabinet and the Executive the necessary warrant for the payment of the excesses, and we place on the table of the </para>

                        <para>- If any honorable member wishes that they should be moved in detail they may be put line by line j but they are generally put under the heads of the various offices in which the excess votes have occurred. We ask for a special vote of Parliament to cover the excess of votes, and include it in our appropriation. Under this system the necessary papers are placed before Parliament, and Parliament is able to say whether the Ministry have properly taken upon themselves the responsibility of providing for the service of the year by these excesses ; and if they have gone beyond what is absolutely requisite they can be called to book. The papers are laid upon the table early in the session. As a rule members look into them and criticise them, and may ask questions about them ; and, if they find that Ministers have exceeded their proper functions, they can call them to book. Parliament in this way never loses its hold of the money which is voted ; and once voted for one particular purpose it is held sacred for that purpose, and no Government can divert it from" the purpose for which it Iras been voted. Under this proposal they may devote money appropriated for one purpose to some other purpose. It is a mistaken principle, and it will be a great deal better for the Government and for the Treasurer, as well as for Parliament, that we should adopt in the Commonwealth the practice we have in South Australia. It will be more satisfactory [all round, and I ask the Senate to excise the clause. </para>

Through not having such a provision as it is proposed to have in this Bill in existence in South Australia, the practice there has been to spend money in anticipation of its being voted by Parliament. That is a technically illegal voting of the money. </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the Tasmanian practice. The honorable senator will accept the fact that four of the States have a provision similar to this clause, and there is nothing before the Senate at the present time to show that the practice which has obtained in these States has not 'been as satisfactory as that obtaining in the two States where such a practice has not existed. It is admitted that in every case there must be some votes for, items under subdivision which will necessarily fall short of what is required. This is considered the best means of supplementing those particular grants in order to enable the Treasurer to carry on. I have not heard anything to convince me that it it is not better to have such a provision as this and a statement laid before Parliament than to take the action which has been taken under the practice in South Australia. </para>

If this Act was the vehicle which enabled them to do so--

Of course there was no Minister responsible for the diversion, because the' Audit Act gave the Government the power to do so.. It was not limited to a small sum, but involved a large amount. There is no limit in this clause. In the opinion of some persons a few hundred thousand pounds may be a small sum. </para>

                        <para>- I take it that there would be a vote for drainage, but there might be a surplus in hand until the authority of Parliament to spend it otherwise had been given. I think it is advisable that we should make Ministers responsible for their departments. Under this provision, they would not be responsible ; they would not have to ask Parliament to sanction the alteration of the expenditure. The order would be laid on the table, and our silence would be taken to give consent. </para>

                        <para>- Such large amounts as the honorable senator quotes could not appear as items in .one subdivision. I shall give an instance which has almost happened to me in administering the Education department in Queensland. Our grant for education was voted in, perhaps, 50, 60, or 100 different items. There would be an item for school material, an item for repairs to schools, and an item for cleaning schools, in one subdivision. When the Minister compiles his Estimates at the commencement of the year, he endeavours to ask for a certain amount which he thinks will be sufficient to carry him on in regard to every item in that subdivision ; and in June, the last month of the year, he finds that the amount which has been voted for cleaning schools has run out, and that he has not used so much as he asked for of the vote for school repairs or school material ; in fact, that he has a balance which will become a lapsed vote on the 30th June if it is not made some use of. He can then go to the Governor in Council and ask. to be allowed to transfer £50 from the vote for school material to the vote for cleaning schools. If he is not allowed to do that, either he will have to give authority for schools to be cleaned illegally, or, if he strictly observer, the law, he will have to allow the schools to become dirty, and on the 30th June he will have perhaps a surplus of £50, £100, or £150 on his vote for school material or school repairs. </para>

                    <para>- It strikes me that we have a choice of evils here. We must either accept the provision which states very clearly that only money can be spent which has been appropriated,, but that if there is a surplus in an item it may be transferred to make up a deficiency in the same subdivision. If that be done, a statement showing the amounts transferred must be laid before Parliament. The alternative is that the Treasurer or the Minister can spend apparently any amount without asking the sanction of Parliament until it has been spent, and then it is practically useless to cry out. The lesser evil is the one provided for, and I intend to support the clause. </para>

                    (South Australia). - There is nothing really in the contention of the Postmaster-General, because the position of South Australia is precisely the same as it. is in the Common wealth. I suppose he will not for a moment dispute this fact, that in the Commonwealth considerable sums will have to be spent before the end of the year at times before the House meets, and the Ministry will have to accept the responsibility of authorizing this expenditure. He admits that this clause only provides for small sums. He must know that in the working of the Estimates there are sure to be many occasions when there will be excesses on various votes.. What provision is there in all the States to meet a case of that sort ? For the smaller sums there is this provision which is proposed in the Bill, but which is considerably modified by the provisions contained in the- law of the various States. They have much larger powers than evidently
                    Turner took when he drafted' this Bill. The power which the Ministry have for expending money on items which have been insufficiently voted is exercised. by means of what are known throughout the States as Cabinet and, Executive Council excess warrants. This is exactly the power winch the Commonwealth has. The Ministry will pass through the Cabinet, and the Executive and the Governor-General will sign the necessary documents approving of a certain excess on a particular vote. The Ministry take upon themselves the responsibility for that excess, and very possibly it is absolutely required, and the Auditor-General is bound to acknowledge the Cabinet excess warrants. He will be bound, in making his report to Parliament, if the Ministry attempt to spend any money without having these Cabinet and Executive Council excess warrants properly passed, to call attention to the irregularity. The fact is that South Australia has no more power in . its Audit Act. There is no special power to meet this case. No special power is wanted. In all the States the same process has to be gone through with regard to excesses on votes. There is not the slightest necessity for the clause., It only applies to exceedingly small sums: It is a great deal better out than in. It is a great deal better for the Government to come down and say straightforwardly : " Here is our excess sheet ; we have spent this money 'without authority, but we have spent it in the interests of the Commonwealth. It is in excess of a certain vote which we found insufficient during, the year. We ask you to approve of our action, and vote more." lt is a plain, straightforward way of doing business, and a great deal better than this small pettifogging method. The effect of it all is, that in. regard to small items one course is to be adopted: whereas the larger items are to be brought down upon excess sheets.

                    <para>- It is not quite clear that the second part of this clause appears in the statutes referred tq in the marginal . notes to the clause ; but I do not think that the second part of the clause in any way contradicts the first, so far as the wording of it is concerned. There is no question about the intention of the clause, that if Parliament be not sitting then the report shall be sent to the Treasurer by the Auditor-General, and he must also transmit it to Parliament within fourteen days after it has met. The second portion of the clause is really a superadded provision in order to give an opportunity to the public to know exactly what appears in the report. The question is whether there is anything much to be gained by it. The Postmaster-General informs me that there is only the first part of the clause in the New South Wales statute, and I expect it will be found to be the same in the South Australian statute. The question is whether there is anything to be gained by the public in having the report published before it can be dealt with by Parliament. Of course we are perfectly well aware that the Auditor-General's report is really a check upon the Treasurer, and a report that comes from an absolutely independent source, and by which we are able to see whether the state of our finances are- - according to this trusted officer - in exactly the same position as they are shown to be by the Treasurer. The question is whether the public will be the gainers by having the report sent through in this particular way. It appears to me that it may mean rather a benefit to the public to have an opportunity of an earlier consideration than they otherwise would have if Parliament be not in session. We know quite well that a document of this character will demand attention at' the hands of the press, who will be prepared to point out to the public anything improper that may be shown to have been done during the time covered by the Auditor-General's report. I do not know whether that would not be rather a gain to the public than otherwise. We know that while it would be giving the Treasurer no opportunity to interfere with the report in any way at all, while it may give him an opportunity of being better prepared to answer anything that may arise in connexion with the report. That will not be a disadvantage, because it may give him a fair opportunity of pointing out to the public where anything is reported which he thinks is not in accordance with the facts, or where the report is of such a character as may cause the public to be misled as to what really was the action of the Government questioned by the report. I think it would be well if honorable senators would agree to keep in the second portion of the clause as an additional precaution, but it might be as well to amend it so as to make it absolutely clear that it is not in substitution in any way for the presentation of the report to Parliament as soon as it may be in session. </para>

                    <para>--With regard to the second portion of the clause, .1 think that it is- probable that though the Commonwealth Parliament may not be sitting at the time, one or more of . the various State Parliaments will certainly be sitting, and it would be a distinct advantage to those State Parliaments to have access to this document, because it will undoubtedly be of great interest to the public men in the various States. I therefore urge that the clause be carried as it stands. </para>

                    (South Australia). - What I wish to point out to
                    is that these Auditor-General's reports, to be of any service at all, should come down early to Parliament, and we should do all we possibly can to insist in getting them before Parliament early. The person to whom we have to look for assistance in bringing them down early is not the Auditor-General, but the Treasurer. Honorable senators will see that it is upon particular statements provided for in previous clauses to be furnished to him by the Treasurer that the Auditor-General bases his report, and until he gets the Treasurer's statement and figures he cannot make his report. Treasurers, perhaps wilfully in certain instances, and through carelessness or dilatoriness in other instances might keep back the statements for such a length of time that the Auditor-General might find it impossible to bring his report forward while Parliament was. sitting. I may say that has never occurred within my knowledge in the history of the South Australian Parliament. Although the Auditor-General's report has often been long delayed, it has always come down before the end of the session. It always will if the Treasurer does his duty, and I say that under no circumstances should we provide
                    loop-hole or hold out by legislation any 'idea of this report not being presented to Parliament when it is in session. , Here we are deliberately, under an Act of Parliament, making provision for a contingency that, I say, never ought to occur. Such a contingency as that of the Auditor-General's report on the finances of the Commonwealth being delayed, beyond the session of Parliament which deals with the Estimates and the receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth, should not be contemplated. We are making deliberate provision for it in this Audit Bill. It is not made in New South

                    with regard to the second portion of the clause. I can see the possibility of a difficulty arising. Suppose the financial year ends on the 30th June, the Treasurer has to submit his report as soon as practicable after that date, and the question arises as to when Parliament is likely to be in session. We are regarding this session as. of- abnormal length, and we are told that in future sessions we shall be able to do our work in a much shorter period of time. The question is at what time of the year we contemplate holding sessions of the Commonwealth Parliament. Are they' to be held during the summer or winter months

If we determine upon that, and the Government carry out that determination, I can see at once that this second portion of the clause is of no value in the Bill, because, we may depend upon it, there will be every inducement to the Treasurer to-send his statement to the Auditor-General in sufficient time to enable that officer to have an opportunity of reporting- to Parliament in the beginning of the session. </para>

Supposing the report does- not come down in time, we shall have no opportunity of seeing it until Parliament is in session again. However, all this is on the assumption that the- months doting which Parliament will be sitting will ' lie changed very much from what they are now. It is- only supposition after all. Nothing has been done yet that I am aware of to fix any other time for the sitting of Parliament than the time at' which most of the States- are accustomed to sit. </para>

                    <para>- I do not join in the fear which has been expressed by some honorable senators with regard to the Auditor-General's report. If Parliament meets at about the same time as it met this year, then the accounts will close on the 30th June, and in the natural order of things his report will be prepared and presented to Parliament within the next two or three months. At any rate that is the case in Queensland. The accounts closed, there on the 30th June, and during thirteen years' experience I do not remember a time when the Auditor-General's report was not placed on the table of the Assembly in August or September, or at the latest in October, and sometimes too late at that, inasmuch as we were always urging that it should be produced before we discussed the Estimates for the next year. The Auditor-General, whoever he may be, will feel it to be his duty, if it be not his pride, to prepare his report as quickly as possible so that it may be laid before Parliament early. If Parliament meets at anything like the time at which it met this year, and the accounts close on the 30th June, his report will be laid on the table of both Houses in August or September. Surely that is early enough. 1 do not think there is any justification to indulge in the fears which have been indulged in. I see no reason to omit the second sub-clause. Even supposing that the Government, when making this appointment, did not impress on the Auditor-General the necessity of preparing his report as early as possible, he, as the servant of Parliament, will naturally be anxious to serve Parliament as efficiently as he can, and so he will prepare his report as early as possible. </para>

                        <para>- That is perfectly true, but the question is which will insure attention to our business best.

                    <para>- It appears to me to be absolutely necessary that the report of the Auditor-General should be presented while Parliament is sitting. The sub-clause contemplates that presentation at some time, probably when it is not sitting. As the financial year ends on the 30th June, Parliament must be summoned to meet near that date, because the Government will want supply to go on with, and Parliament ought never to consent to consider any financial statement until the report of the Auditor-General is in its possession. In Queensland on several occasions the report was presented late, and we were very much at sea in discussing the Budget for the year, and then it was borne in upon me very forcibly that before the financial statement should be discussed the Auditor-General's report on the transactions of the previous year should be in our hands. I do not know why this sub-clause was put in. It appears to me to be an attempt to provide for some contingency which ought not to arise. Why should the report be presented when Parliament is not. sitting ? The financial year ends on the 30th June, and clause 50 provides that as soon as practicable after that date the Treasurer shall prepare a full and particular statement, that it shall be submitted to the Auditor-General, and that he shall make a report upon it. Parliament undoubtedly ought to be sitting somewhere in July. If it were not sitting in July, how could the Government carry on without cash ? And if that is the case, where does the need come in for the sub-clause ? </para>

                    <para>- If a debt were taken over by the Commonwealth the interest on which would be charged on the 1 st July, and if it were taken over on 2nd July, I assume that the Government would expect the State to meet the interest up to that date ? Suppose the debt were taken over on the 29th June, could not the Government of the State call upon the 'Commonwealth Government to pay that interest instead of paying the interest over to the Commonwealth Government itself? It would be practically giving the State an extra half-year's interest under this provision. The Government practically say to the States that the Commonwealth takes thu transfer of the debt, but that the interest' due for the past six months is to be paid out of the current six months; so that the Commonwealth would be paying a premium equivalent to six. months' interest.- </para>
