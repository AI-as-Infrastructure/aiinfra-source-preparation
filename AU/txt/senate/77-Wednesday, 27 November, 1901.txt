                        <para>We -cannot discuss this Bill altogether apart from, the financial proposals of the Government. The Government are proposing to ask the people of Australia to make a considerable sacrifice in order to facilitate the substitution of white for kanaka labour. That natural movement -which has been going on for a long time past in favour of substituting the higher paid and more effective labour for the cheaper and less effective labour can surely be greatly facilitated by the adoption of such proposals as the Government are submitting in another place. It is clearly necessary that these two measures should be considered together. A strong justification for the action of the Government in introducing this measure, and asking Parliament to deal with it now, is that until the people of Australia understand clearly what is to be the attitude of Parliament in regard to it, a decision cannot be arrived at upon the measure which has been submitted to honorable members in another place. </para>

                        <para>That we were induced to go into sugar-cane fanning in -1893, at a time when all Australia was in dire distress, and an almost universal cry was raised almost imploring the people to go out on the land and produce, that being the first and most essential step in the direction of retrieving the losses of that period of awful collapse. </para>
                        <para> The contents of that pamphlet, and the assurance, above all things, as to the labour were the sole inducements to us to settle in this district in aud since 1893. </para>

                        <para>We do not dilate upon the humane side of the question, for we feel too proudly conscious that no honorable fellow Australian would ever accuse us of aught but ''' fair play " to those who work for and are dependent on us. </para>

                    <para>The Pacific Ocean occupies about one-half of the surface of the globe. It is the greatest stretch of water the earth contains, and, within the Pacific Ocean there are a great many more islands than those from which Queensland has been in the habit of importing kanakas. Most of the islands of Japan are in the Pacific. The British island of Vancouver - a part of the Canadian dominions - is in the Pacific Ocean. By this clause there is no doubt at all that we include a large number of the people of Japan. It cannot be said that we include, them all, because on one side of some of the- islands of Japan there lies the Sea of Japan, and I take it, that to be in the Pacific Ocean means- that the waters of the Pacific must entirely surround the island. There are many of the islands of Japan which are absolutely surrounded by the waters of the' Pacific Ocean, and we have, therefore, by this clause included a considerable number of the people b"f Japan. I see that by paragraph (6), persons employed as part of the crew of a ship are exempt. There are exemptions under the Queensland Act, and I suppose this must be read in connection with them. This exemption, I suppose, will be taken to include those who are employed in the pearl shell industry, and we therefore see that a concession of a very important character is granted, not for five years, but in perpetuity. </para>

                    <para>I want to ask how we can pass this- Bill in priority to the Immigration Restriction Bill? How can we pass this Bill through committee when it contains a clause referring to the Immigration Restriction Bill which we have not yet considered, much less agreed to ? I would remind the Senate that the Immigration Restriction Bill was passed through nearly all its stages before this Bill was put before the House of Representatives, and why we should be asked to agree to a Bill which refers to a provision in another measure with which we have not yet dealt is a question which I think needs some little explanation. </para>

                            <para>- It is in favour of having .no such clause ; it is in favour of dealing with the kanaka in the same way as we intend to deal with other coloured aliens. I take it for granted that the true course of legislation in regard to this measure would be that we should pass the second reading, go into committee, and then try to beat some common sense and fair play into it. We should certainly give to the sugar industry in Queensland a longer limit of life than seems to be possible for it under the Bill as it now stands. </para>

At present it is certainly not increasing j indeed, it is suffering under a very great depression - so great indeed that only three or four months ago it was the avowed intention of the owners of certain mills . and land to withdraw from the industry - to save as much out of the wreck at they could, and then withdraw. It is of no use denying, that. But if the sugar industry is doomed to. disappear, what have we to take its place ? Nothing.

                        <para>At the present time sugar-growing is our most important agricultural industry. About one-fourth of all the cultivated laud in Queensland is under sugar-cane, and three-fourths of the value of all Queensland's agricultural exports must be credited to sugar. The number of white persons directly or indirectly supported by the industry cannot be less than 20,000- </para>

                    <para>A brief sketch of its origin, progress, and prospects may therefore be of some interest just now. </para>
                    <para>The first attempt at sugar-growing in Queensland, on a commercial scale, was made in the early sixties, when the Hon. Louis Hope, a near kinsman of the first Governor-General of the Australian Commonwealth, commenced operations in the neighbourhood of Cleveland. His labourers were islanders from Erromanga  and Tanna. By 1868 he had 80 acres under cane, and had received State encouragement in the shape of a grant of land on which to build a sugar mill. Meanwhile his example had been followed by other Queenslanders. In 1866 the Pimpama  Sugar Company had 50 acres under cane, and, with very primitive machinery, had produced 30 tons of sugar, which realized Â£1,200. About the same time, John Spiller took 10,000 cane plants, to begin sugar cultivation with in Mackay. Soon afterwards, J. E. Davidson had 270 acres under cane in the same district </para>
                    <para>Very slowly did the industry begin to give indications of the magnitude it was to attain. In 1868 the quantity of land under cane in the north did not exceed 400 acres. In the whole State there were only ten mills, all of them poorly equipped. There were two in Maryborough, which could each turn out 30 tons of sugar a week, but there was not enough cane to keep them constantly working through the crushing season. The general capacity of the mills was 1 1/2 to 2 tons of sugar daily. </para>
                    <para>It is obvious that with such primitive appliances sugar-growing could not have been then a very profitable occupation. Indeed it is probable that the industry would never have survived had it not been that sugar was fetching from Â£30 to Â£40 a ton, and that, practically, kanakas were then permitted to do any work in connexion with a sugar plantation. Not only were they allowed to perform field work ; they were employed as scrub cutters, mill hands, draymen, and in other occupations from which they were subsequently, and are still, excluded by law. Even then it was demonstrated that sugar-growing could not be successfully earned on by white labour alone. Nearly every grower tried to do without black labour, but in the end discovered that sugar culture, in such circumstances, spelt ruin. </para>
                    <para>As time advanced the prospects of the sugargrower brightened. Facilities for procuring suitable labour were increased ; capital was easier to obtain ; the State gave the industry every encouragement ; and, ten years from the time when Captain Hope had harvested his first crop, the sugar manufactured in Queensland had risen to over 10,000 tons per annum. Ten years later it had risen to between 50,000 and 60,000 tons. During those ten 3'ears the area of land under sugar cane had increased from 13,000 acres to 59,000 acres, while the area under all other crops had increased only from 64,000 acres to 1 39,000 acres. In other words, the area under cane increased at the rate of 35 per cent, annually, while that under all other crops increased only at the rate of 12 per cent. Then came a period of decline. </para>
                    <para>The number of acres under cane, which was 59,186 in 1885, diminished to 54,010 in 1886, to 51,815 in 1887, to 47,340 acres in 1888, and, indeed, did not get back to the figures of 1S85 until 1893. </para>

                    <para>During this period, of depression about 50 mills out of 166 ceased working, and the output of sugar in one of the lean years fell below 35,000 tons. What, it may be asked, was the cause of this disaster to an industry which had to all appearances been established on a durable basis, and had given promise of such splendid and lasting prosperity? </para>
                    <para>The answer is that an experiment had been tried at the expense of the sugar-grower, perhaps the most costly and ruinous experiment ever attempted in Australia. It is to be noted that it was not done at the wish of the sugar-grower, for lie was already aware what the result would be. But, though it was attempted against his will, he had to discharge the account as if it 'had been incurred at his suggestion. Yet, expensive as it was, the experiment was in the end considered not an unmixed calamity ; for it was thought that one good result of it would be that never again would the industry be brought to the verge of ruin through the motives that had actuated the experimentalists. </para>
                    <para>It has been mentioned that, after some futile endeavours to grow sugar by white labour alone, the employment of kanakas became general on the plantations. But there was a large and ever increasing party in Queensland who held that black labour was unnecessary. This part3', having obtained an overwhelming majority at the general election of 1883, brought 'into the Legislative Assembly a Bill which passed without division, and which provided that the issue of the licences for the introduction of kanakas should cease on the 31st of December, 1800. </para>
                    <para>In the interval efforts were made to introduce field labour from continental Europe, but without any satisfactory result-. It was hoped by those opposed to coloured labour that if the system of small holdings were substituted for that of large plantations - and that has come about in the most remarkable manner - which had up to the time prevailed, cane might be grown profitably by the small owner and his family without the help of black labour, with the assistance of the State in the provision of mills. The central mill system was accordingly instituted. Two such mills were erected at Mackay in 1880, and it was originally intended that these mills should crush only cane grown by white labour, but the event showed that the kanaka was still indispensable, even to the .small farmer </para>
                    <para>In the meantime, the sugar industry, once so vigorous and prosperous, was slowly expiring. So unsatisfactory was its condition, that within five years of the date on which the Act was passed, a Royal commission was appointed to inquire into the industry. This commission presented its report in April, 1880. The report disclosed the fact that the Queensland sugar industry was decaying,- but the commissioners could not agree among themselves as to the best means of reviving it </para>
                    <para>By the end of 1801 it had become manifest that the continuance of the prohibition of South Sea </para>
                    <para>Accordingly, u special session of Parliament was summoned in February, 1892, to deal with the question. Legislation was then pissed which established the conditions under which Polynesian labour is available for sugar-growing to this very day. The debates and divisions on that legislation proved that the events of the preceding six years had not been without effect on all reasonable men - and I hope we shall deal with this question as reasonable men - and the proposals were carried by large majorities in both Houses of Parliament. When the question was raised at the general election in the following year, it was found that a corresponding change had taken place in the constituencies. - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Of this last-mentioned fact there can be no doubt, though it has lately been asserted that the issue was never put before the people until the Commonwealth elections this year. The fact is. that at the general election of 1 803 the sugar legislation of the previous year was challenged in the most emphatic way by the leader of the Opposition, who made " a white Queensland " the; most conspicuous plank in his platform. Yet, the verdict of the constituencies was unmistakably in favour of the steps taken to save the sugar - industry. Two general elections have been since held, in 1890 and 1890, the result of each being; that people and Parliament decided to leave undisturbed the settlement arrived at in 1892. </para>
                        <para>Respecting the recent federal elections, and the contention that they prove Queensland to be hostile to existing labour arrangements, it need only be said that no such conclusion will be drawn by those who were aware of the influences at work during those elections. The labour party, it is. true, triumphed at the polls ; and the labour party is opposed to the employment of the kanaka - </para>

                            <para>- I say that we have against this Bill the opinions of all the bodies I have named, and in the case of three out of four recent by-elections that have taken place, the seats were captured from the anti-kanaka party. They were all labour seats, and three' were captured, and are now in the hands of supporters of the Philp Government, who are opposed to the Bill which has been introduced here. I speak facts, and with all the facts staring us in the face, I ask the Senate to have an inquiry, which could be held during the short recess we are to have. We could invite the farmers of the north to come down and say what they mean. If 5 per cent, of the actual farmers of Cairns will say that they can grow sugar with white labour, I shall vote for the Bill. But to my mind it will be a monstrous shame for the Senate in rapid haste, without due inquiry, to pass a Bill against what I regard as the unanimous voice of Queensland. The representatives of Queensland ought to hail with delight any honorable senator who will take up the cudgels on behalf of the Queensland Government, because if this is not a State right, then never will a State right arise, so far as I can see. No wonder that the Government of Queensland are anxious about this Bill when they have advanced Â£359,000 to sugar-growers in the north, for the erection of mills. They cannot afford to lose that sum, especially as there has been a deficit of about half-a-million. </para>

                            <para>- If that cap fits let the wearers of it beware. I know Queensland well, having lived in some parts of it for a considerable time. When riding in the noon-day sun my horse has often rushed under a tree, and I have been unable to spur him out into the sun again. I have . seen bullock teams that could not be goaded from under the shade of a tree or a house. There is no necessity to pass this Bill this, session. Who is asking us to do it 1 </para>

                    <para>The whole point- is the .unreliableness of the labour. I can well understand that they do not get the most reliable labour, for the reasons that the wages paid are such as do not attract high-class workmen who shrink from incurring the inconvenience and hardship attaching to working in the cane-fields. High-class workmen look for better employment, and for something which suits them better, and at which they can earn better wages. Second and third rate wages are paid instead of first rate wages, and consequently it can only be expected that second and third rate men will gravitate there. Under present conditions, high-class men can find employment more suitable to themselves at a better rate of wages. The other day we were told that had it not been for the northern cane-growers there would have been no federation. It is said that the people of southern Queensland were opposed to federation, but that the northern people voted for the Commonwealth Bill, and that, had not Queensland joined the federation, New South Wales would not have done so. Consequently, there would have been no federation at all. That is the argument which is used. But does any one for a moment suppose that the cane-growers joined the Federation out of mere sentiment? Did they not join it to benefit themselves ? </para>

                            <para>- Yet in the same breath the honorable senator told us that immediately the local production of sugar exceeded the consumption, it would be sold at the world's prices. I should like to know how these two statements are to be reconciled. According to the honorable senator, immediately the production exceeds the consumption, we shall not have to pay any more for sugar than is paid in England. </para>

                            <para>- It was ; but the Act was passed by the party which has held office for so many years. If honorable senators care to look up the papers they will find that at each revision court hundreds of names have been struck ofF the rolls in this way. It is difficult for a man to get enrolled, and then he has a hard job to keep his name on the roll, because of the action of paid mercenaries employed by the conservative party. </para>

                            <para>- We all know how these things happen. Probably the secretary of an association in Brisbane said, "We are holding a meeting, and we are going to send down a resolution. See if you can get a meeting of your committee or your society, and carry this resolution." Evidently that has been done in this. case. In the aggregate these bodies probably do not amount to more than a few hundred persons. </para>

                            <para>- I was a municipal councillor fora little time. The position goes a-begging because it carries no pay, but a great deal of abuse and much hard work. Excepting those who put up for the honour of the position, the men who stand think there may be a few contracts about. It is regarded by some persons as a stepping stone to a position of greater prominence. But what alderman goes before his constituents and says, " Ladies and gentlemen, I intend to propose that we consider the kanaka question at our next monthly meeting." The thing never crops up. </para>

                            <para>- That shows that there was no interest taken on the other side. The only public meeting of any importance held in Brisbane was a meeting to which admission was by ticket, and, in many cases, by the back, entrance. The Mayor so far forgot himself as to refuse to accept an amendment to the resolution. In fact, the Mayor was so enthusiastic about the sugar question that he would not allow an opponent to get up on the platform, and so far forgot his. dignity as to push this man off. The man. was going to take an action against the Mayor unless he apologized through the public press. </para>

                        <para>With the conditions of nature thus differentiated, and divided into zones indicated by the respective districts, I will, in the first place, set forth the proportions of white settlers who are cane-growers upon the areas under cane in the respective districts ; and afterwards note the relative numbers of kanaka labourers at work in the cane-fields within these districts. There are 2,610 cane-farmers in Queensland, and these are distributed as follows : - </para>

                    <para>I will now note the proportions of kanaka labour employed in three sugar districts, and also in relation to the areas under cane. The total number of male kanakas in Queensland at this time, according to the figures furnished to me personally by Registrar-General Hughes, is 8,656, of which number, 7,615 are known to be engaged in sugar-cane culture, and are distributed through the districts as follows :-  </para>

                        <para>When we compare the number of kanakas with the areas of cane in the respective districts in Bundaberg, where the white settlement is the greatest, in that district there being one farmer to 32 acres, we find that there is only one kanaka to 24 acres ; in Mackay, where each white farmer controls 42 acres of cane, there is one kanaka to 17 acres, and when we reach the tropical areas of the Cairns district, where every farmer cultivates 72 acres of cane, there is one kanaka to less than 9 acres of cane. We thus see that the relative densities of white settlement upon the canegrowing areas, and the relative proportions of kanakas employed upon those areas in the respective districts, are very generally in accord with the variations in the climatic conditions of those districts.  </para>

                        <para>We cannot, by any mode of reasoning, come to consider that the measures now before the Federal Parliament indicate an adequate knowledge of the matters with which they propose to deal. It is also difficult to conceive that the Prime Minister has foreseen how his proposals must operate in the several sugar districts ; and it is mere justice to conclude that the right honorable gentleman does not apprehend what will be in' certain districts the fruits of their operation if they become enacted into law. </para>

                            <para>- As far as I can recollect, he was asked whether a cane farmer who owned his land could do the work, and he said - " Yes," and he was referring to the Bundaberg district at the time. He added that he had control of the situation, and could work in the morning or in the evening as he liked, indicating that when men were under the rule of syndicates or other employers they were compelled to work throughout the heat of the day, and could not, therefore, do the work as well. We claim that white men can do the work also in the northern districts. It may be necessary to refer to the matter in committee, but I shall not now bother the Senate with particulars as to the number of horses, sheep, and cattle produced in the northern district of Queensland. I observe that some senators seem to be under the impression that if we do away with the kanaka the sugar industry will have to be abandoned in the north, and a large tract of country will, therefore, be left lying idle. Nothing is further from the facts. There are some 37,000 acres under cane in the north, and that only amounts to some 50 odd square miles in extent, but honorable senators must not lose sight of the fact that that there are other things produced in the north besides sugar, and the land will not lie fallow. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do hot. I think that as soon as wages rise, as they will rise, white men will be found to do the work. People talk of the necessity for an inquiry, but we have had an inquiry, and every honorable senator has had a copy of the report and evidence. Let any honorable senator go through the evidence given at that inquiry, and he will learn the reason why white men do not. stick to the cane-fields. They have gone to the cane-fields, but as soon as ever a bit of a rush to a gold-field has taken place the men have gone away. That has been the experience throughout every gold-mining district in Australia, and that kind of thing will always happen. </para>

                            <para>- My own opinion is that if the work is as hard as some people have described it, Â£3 per week would not be too little to pay the men. I know there are certain economic laws which govern the rate of wages. I know that. at the present time, the most undesirable and the most despicable work, if any work can be called despicable, is the poorest paid. There seems to be a consensus of opinion that the dirty work of the community should be poorly paid. I know that there are certain rules or laws regulating rates of wages, and I know there is competition", and that where two men-offer themselves for one billet wages are sure to go down. </para>

                        <para>For twelve years I was a missionary on Tanna, an island of the New Hebrides Group. I went there with a mind perfectly open, so far as the kanaka labour traffic was concerned. For the first ten years of my life in the New Hebrides, I was a silent observer of all forms of the kanaka labour traffic. And probably my voice would never have been heard on the matter bad Queensland not renewed the traffic in 1892. Having suffered and seen the evils of the traffic in the past, I was constrained to speak when the Queensland Government renewed the traffic in the year just named. An intimate knowledge of what the traffic is in the islands would have been sufficient warrant for speaking on the subject. But in order to have a more perfect knowledge, when the opportunity was given me of visiting Queensland, I laid myself out to acquire all possible knowledge in the time at my disposal. Though convinced that however good the traffic migh't be in Queensland, the goodness claimed for it there could not compensate for the evils inseparable from it in the islands, yet, I went to Queensland determined to keep my mind open to every possible fact in favour of the traffic. And having been to Queensland, I would say now what I would not have said before I went to Queensland, namely, that the kanaka labour is veiled shivery. </para>

                    <para>Are honorable senators going to ignore the evidence of men who can surely claim to be disinterested in. this matter? They have no profits to derive in the way of dividends from colonial sugar refining companies. They have nothing whatever to gain, so far as I can see, by writing in this way. I can well believe that they have something to lose from the point of view of subscriptions to the missionary cause. </para>

I am sure I would not care to undertake the work of these gentlemen, even if I thought I was fit for it. I am satisfied that the man who goes down to these islands sacrifices a great deal of the comforts of this world. I. regard" these gentlemen as perfectly disinterested witnesses, and I would ask whether we are going to ignore their opinions and evidence, and to accept the testimony even of experts ? Are we to' ignore the evidence of these missionaries, and to accept that of men who, it must be admitted, are largely interested in the industry, and who say that if .we take away kanaka labour the industry will be ruined ? We challenge that statement. We say that the industry will not be ruined, and we cannot regard the evidence of interested parties as not being of an impartial character compared with that put forward by missionaries who have been or are stationed on the islands. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators must have read in the press of recent date of the tribal wars now taking place in Tanna. The islands from which these kanakas come are in a state of continual ferment. Many of the tribes on the islands are cannibals, 41nd if they could get hold of a white man they would very soon eat him. "We have to face the" plain fact that the Government agent on board a recruiting vessel does not go ashore, and he cannot always see what is taking place. With regard to the treatment of the kanaka when he is in Queensland, I do not intend to go into that matter at this stage, although, if necessary, I shall do so in committee. There are other honorable senators who wish to speak, and I am not going into all the facts that I could produce regarding the treatment of kanakas in Queensland. Although some employers there treat the kanakas humanely, many use them infamously. It is only occasionally, however, that the public of Queensland hear of it. </para>

                        <para>At the Cairns Police Court, on Tuesday, September 10, before the police magistrate, five kanakas were charged with absenting  themselves from hired service for three days without leave. The prosecutor was the manager of the Mulgrave mill. The Inspector of Pacific Islanders watched the case for the boys. The Mulgrave mill was represented b}7 a solicitor, who stated he was instructed to press for heavy penalties. Three of the boys had been before the court previously for refusing to come to work. They had gone up town and got drunk. The Inspector of Pacific Islanders asked each boy if he had. "worked alonga Monday last week." The boys said, "No bin work." This concluded the case. The police magistrate fined two boys Â£5. each, with Â±'1 ls. professional costs, and 4s. (id. costs of court each. "No goods, your worship," said the Inspector of Pacific Islanders. "Two months' gaol, then." The other three boys were fined Â£20 and costs each, and upon confessing no goods, got four months gaol. </para>

                            <para>- Can the honorable senator say for one moment that there was in Queensland any knowledge as to what the contents of this Bill would be, as to whether the time allowed would be five years or seven years, or as to the mode in which the abolition of the kanaka traffic was to be brought about ? There was no misunderstanding in Queensland that the kanaka had to go, but I think it is to be regretted that those interested did not ascertain a little more definitely what method was to be proposed for removing them. I do not know that I can blame the Government for that. The Government could not at that time have disclosed their hand,' but I think those interested might probably have quietly ascertained a little more definitely than apparently they did what the views of the Prime Minister were upon the matter. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there is a strong feeling in Queensland on the subject. I may frankly say in passing, that, so far as the Senate is concerned, I do not share the opinion of those who think that we ought to ignore the views of the representatives of the State in the Senate. They undoubtedly have been returned as representatives of Queensland to this Senate, and we recognise them only as the representatives of Queensland, and it would never do for the Commonwealth to allow any of the States to dictate or attempt to dictate directly or indirectly in connexion with any piece of legislation the Commonwealth may think it necessary to undertake. I mention that in pissing, but at the same time, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there is undoubtedly friction in Queensland upon this matter. That is certainly borne out by the voluminous papers sent to us during the last month or so from harbor boards, chambers of commerce, various agricultural societies - I- think some 22 of them - from a large number of farmers, engaged in the- industry, and from others directly interested in the passage of this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator has received any from the kanakas and has not passed them on for the benefit of his brother senators I very much regret it, because I have been anxious to get all the information I could from both sides. We have also recently received the letter from the Premier of Queensland. Of course, it is not a letter from the Parliament of Queensland, but we cannot ignore the fact that the Premier is the political head of the State, and the only one who has the right to speak for the Cabinet and for Queensland in such matters. I cannot conceive for one moment that any Premier would send such a letter without having first of all submitted it to, and obtained the consent, of his colleagues in the Cabinet. Are we to suppose that the whole of these parties, necessarily interested in this Bill, do not know anything about the subject, or that they are advocating an extension of time, or an. amendment of the Bill, purely from selfish motives ? </para>

                            <para>- That is an unknown quantity. So far as the temperate zone is concerned, I think we are right in assuming that a white man can do more labour than a black man. But when you go into the tropical territory, so far as I have been able to ascertain in 'connexion not only with this matter, but others, the black labour has an advantage over the white. Therefore, there would not be anything like the same advantage to the growers in the tropical regions as there would be to those at Bundaberg or Mackay. In other words, we can practically say that if this went on for any time, Cairns would be ruined, while Mackay and Bundaberg would gain yearly a large sum. </para>

                            <para>- In any arrangement under this Bill. Even supposing that we give extra time, undoubtedly so long as this bonus is given Cairns will be at a disavantage  compared with Bundaberg and Mackay. I do not see how we can get over that under the Constitution Act. The whole point, so far as I can ascertain, is whether the whites work in these tropical regions. We know that they can work in Mackay and Bundaberg. </para>

I do not wish to say anything more about this matter save that the motion for the second reading of the Bill will receive my support. When we get into committee I hope that some one will move that the term within which this traffic is to cease shall be increased by two or three years. I hope that in justice to those who have an interest in the industry we shall deal with the matter fairly ; that we shall yield to the unmistakable request made by a large body of people in Queensland who must know a good deal more of the subject than do a majority of honorable senators, and that Queensland will have cause for full satisfaction in having left the matter in the hands of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I took the statement which the honorable senator made to the Senate in his speech on the address in reply. A great deal has been made of the fact that a number of semi-public bodies in Queensland have sent in resolutions asking for a continuance of this traffic on certain terms. There are Victorian senators who remember that when a prominent politician outlined his policy throughout Victoria, resolutions were passed bv shire councils, and by waterworks boards, and bodies similar to those passing resolutions in Queensland. He went to the electors ; but he came back with scarcely a score of followers, and was turned out of office immediately he faced Parliament. I am afraid that what took place then is taking place now - that the resolutions we are receiving are not from bodies which are representative of the people, but are from those who are directly interested in the continuance of the kanaka traffic, that is, the sugar planters themselves. Something has been -said as to the treatment of the kanakas in this traffic. What has been said on the part of the missionaries is evidence that we can very well receive as unbiased. But I think I can give evidence which is equally unbiased, and which, it might be thought, would be in favour of the sugarplanter's side, if it were at all biased, and that is the evidence of His Majesty's officials in command of the various vessels that have control of the Pacific. I am sure that they would not be suspected of having any leaning towards the labour party on this question, or of being in favour of parrot cries or political cries. What do they say ? </para>

                            <para>- If the planters wish to pay a good wage to their white employes let them advocate the passing of such a measure as the Industrial Arbitration Act, which is in force in New Zealand and in Western Australia. That will enable all differences between employer and employed to be settled. If such a tribunal is established, I will guarantee that there will soon be a sufficiency of white labour to carry on the sugar industry iu Queensland. </para>
