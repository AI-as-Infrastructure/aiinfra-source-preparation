            <para>- It is not the intention of the Government to proceed with any of the other business on the notice- paper this afternoon. We hope to be able to get the debate on the Address in Reply closed early, and I do not think it will be worth while to go on with any other business. We must meet next Wednesday, and on that day I expect that we shall be able to get through all the formal business on the notice-paper. I hope that wo shall finish the debate to-day in time to enable honorable members who wish to get away to catch their trains. </para>

            <para>. - As I listened to the debate during the last two evenings I had a great feeling of regret that I was not able to bo present during the first three days of it. My fellow senators are aware that I was performing an important duty during those three days, and I think they will not blame m for my absence. But I should have liked it very much if events had happened so that I could have performed that duty, and also had the pleasure and profit of hearing the opinions expressed by honorable members. It was in Queensland that I first learned, to my surprise, that an amendment had been moved to the Address in Reply. It was moved also upon a subject with which I am fairly acquainted, and in which I am deeply interested. I naturally desired that before the debate terminated I should have on opportunity of being present to say a few words, and also to speak perhaps in defence of the policy of the Government. But on arriving here I found, to my astonishment, that the enemy had fled and abandoned his guns, and there is really nothing now to fight about. Still, as I am here, I would like to say a few words with regard to this very important matter, and as I am accustomed to endeavour to find good in everything, I think that perhaps after all it is not a misfortune that the amendment has been moved. We might have been perfectly sure that the policy of the Government would be attacked, but he would have been a very bold man, I think, who the week before last would have ventured to prophesy whether the policy of the Government in this matter would be attacked on the ground that we were going too fast and too far, or on the ground that we were not going fast enough or far enough. We know now that the latter attitude is the one that has been taken up by honorable members sitting on the other side of this Chamber. </para>

              <para>- In spite of the honorable member's denial I think I shall be able to show that the two matters are intimately connected. I do not say that the honorable member stated there was a connexion, but I state it. I am very pleased to have this opportunity of meeting the honorable member, because, though I have not met him before in the flesh, I have read of him very often. I may say that in Queensland his name is a household word, and I have always recognised him there, though I have not been able to agree with his conclusions, as correct in his facts, and us what I should call n true exponent of the gospel of free-trade according to Cobden. The honorable member disagreed with the Vice-President of the Executive Council with regard to some of the figures that he quoted in connexion with the supply and consumption of sugar in Australia. I think it was mode pretty clear as the debate went on that the inaccuracy, which the honorable member thought he had discovered, was simply the result of my honorable colleague having quoted the figures for one year, whilst he had quoted the figures for another year. </para>

              <para>- No, it fixes the price of sugar that is exported from Queensland to England. What I want to make clear is this, because it is here the subject is so intimately connected with .that of black labour, that at the present' time the sugar produced in Queensland, where, of course, there is an import duty, as there is in the other colonies, has to be sold in competition with sugar grown in other countries by means of black labour, and also in countries where they have the system of bounties. That being so, if we are going to say to the sugar producers in Australia that they must produce their sugar by means of white labour, then I think we may be fairly asked to put such an import duty on sugar as wall prevent the Queensland product from having to be sold in competition with sugar that has been grown almost wholly by black labour. It is very cheap indeed for honorable senators who have been sent here from other places to tell us that block labour must be abolished in Australia, and at the same time to say that they are willing that sugar which- has been grown almost exclusively by block labour shall be brought in here to compete with the Sugar which is being grown in Queensland said New South Wales. If we are going to take up the position, which I hope this Parliament will always take up, that block labour must be abolished in Australia, then I say we ought to see that the people engaged in the production of sugar here are placed in the same position as those who are growing it in other places. </para>

              <para>- The sugar grown in Queensland is grown with the help of black labour. It has been decreed by the people of Australia - and this Parliament is engaged in carrying out their will - that black labour in Queensland shall be abolished. That being so, I say you should give to the producers of sugar in Australia a certain amount of protection, to compensate them for being compelled to give effect to the will of the Australian people. </para>

              <para>- I think decidedly not. It is an industry that is firmly established ; an industry which I believe, even when black labour is taken away, will continue to flourish ; and I, not holding the views of the free-traders, say that it is an enormous advantage to a country to be able to supply itself with all the necessaries that it requires. It would be a great misfortune for Australia if we were ever to take such a step as would stamp out the production 'of sugar, and make us dependent on foreign countries. I cannot see myself how any senator who believes in a white Australia can deliberately contemplate crushing out any natural industry in Australia and substituting in place of it a product coming from foreign countries where they employ black labour. </para>

But we say that though we believe the sugar industry can be carried on, and all the sugar required in Australia, and, perhaps, some for export can be produced by white labour, yet, if the producer in Queensland or New South Wales is compelled to employ white labour, at white men's wages, he should not be thrown into open competition with the countries employing all blacks. </para>

              <para>- I am of opinion that white labour will work anywhere for sufficient wages. I om simply pointing out the difficulties that exist in that particular part of the State ; whereas in Bundaberg there is a floating population which might take to the work readily. In the Mackay district they have an incipient dairying industry which gives employment to a considerable number of white men, but it is in the particular district which I have singled out that the greatest difficulty occurs. There is no white labour there, abd it would be necessary to take it there specially in order to substitute it for coloured labour. If we were to adopt the course which some honorable members on the opposition side of the Senate have been trying to dictate to the Government, and do away with the black labour at once, I make no doubt the result would be to close up some of these mills, and probably to throw the land out of cultivation. I believe that if the matter is dealt with in a fair and reasonable manner white labour may be substituted for black, and the sugar industry may not only be carried on there as in the past but it will be the scene of considerable extra activity, when, us I hope, the markets of Australia will be preserved for the Australian producer. We have been discussing for the greater part of the time the kanaka phase of the question, which is admittedly not the most difficult feature of the Government programme with regard to coloured labour. We have to face the very important subject of how to deal with other forms of coloured labour in Australia, and I hope the Government will have in this matter the solid support of the Senate, as I believe they have of the people of Australia. Something has been said during the debate with regard to the position of the Senate, and the other Chamber. </para>

              <para>- That is what I was. just going to say. The rights of the Senate are embodied in the Constitution, and we need not alarm ourselves at the present tune in regard to our position. I think that the position of the Senate will be assured not by protestations, and certainly not by putting ourselves in a hostile attitude before any attack is threatened, but by conducting ourselves in such a way as to secure for us the confidence of the people of Australia. </para>

Those telegrams are the subject and the basis of the other communications which are not confidential, and it will be impossible to understand one without the other. Honorable members will see at once that we are quite willing to give the information but inasmuch as it includes confidential communications which cannot be made public without the consent of the party who has made them confidential we cannot do so.
