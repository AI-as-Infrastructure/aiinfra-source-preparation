                    <para>. - 1 am prepared, if it is in accordance with the wishes of the committee, to postpone this clause until after the consideration of the remainder of the Bill, hut I would like first to make a short statement with regard to some difficulty which appeared at the previous sitting. I propose to make an amendment in clause 78 which I think will meet to a very great extent the objections taken by some honorable senators. That clause gives power to the Postmaster-General with regard to the construction and maintenance of any telegraph line. I have not with me the exact words of the amendment; but I propose after the words "by such person" in the first paragraph to insert the words " either for the Telegraph department or for any private person," or words to that effect. So that clause 77 will place telegraph lines, including, of course, telephone lines, under the Telegraph department, making it practically a monopoly ; while clause 78 will provide that the Postmaster-General may exercise that monopoly on behalf of the department or allow private persons to construct or maintain telegraph or telephone lines. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is absolutely necessary that the telegraph lines should be in the hands of the department. I cannot draw back from that at all. We must start from that point, that the telegraph service is to be a State monopoly, and if that is conceded, then we can give the fullest possible range to private persons who desire to have telegraphic or telephonic communication on their private property. That is what has been done in all the States. </para>

                        <para>- The department should have control over wires outside the boundaries of the property owners ; but when a wire crosses a block of lond, which may be 20,000 acres in extent, and which is owned by one individual, not the slightest difficulty should be raised in regard to the crossing of roads, many of which are never used at all, whilst others are very seldom used on account of the sparsity of the population. If it be necessary that the Commonwealth should retain in its own hands some rights over those roads, that can be met by the payment of a small fee '. for every road crossed. But that the construction, maintenance, and control of these wires within a private domain or within a warehouse in Sydney or Melbourne or elsewhere should remain in the . hands of the post-office is an exhibition of red-tapism for which I should not have given the Postmaster-General credit. </para>

It is for no reason connected with the convenience of the post-office, or of any official, that this position has been taken up, but because the post-office represents the people of the Commonwealth, and it has been decided that they shall hold this monopoly in their hands for the benefit of the Commonwealth. It is not a question of considering any individual or official. The interests of the Commonwealth alone have to to be considered. </para>

It seems to me that we must trust the Postmaster-General to deal reasonably with persons who require these conveniences. If a road has to be crossed, let each case be dealt with on its own merits. It may be that the road is a mere road on paper, in which case probably no difficulty would arise as to a line crossing it. On the other hand it may be a road under the control of a municipality, in which case care must be taken that no rights are given to a private individual which will interfere with the use of the road for the general purposes pf the telegraphic system. If the Postmaster-General has authority to grant this leave on such conditions as he thinks fit he must be trusted to make reasonable arrangements. In a case where it did not matter whether roads are crossed or not, probably there would be very little restriction; but in a case where the crossing of a road by a wire might be a matter of importance, care would be taken to preserve the public interest. If a power is given which will enable a person owning property to construct a Une on that property if he thinks fit-- </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - May I coll attention to the necessity of making a little alteration in claude S2, which relates to the cutting down of trees up to within 20 feet of an existing telegraph line or a pathway upon which a line may be constructed in the future? These paths run from 9 to 12 feet wide. If this provision is to be carried it means that no tree can grow within 21 feet of the boundary of any property. 'If that provision is passed it will necessitate my cutting down a large avenue of trees which have been growing for over thirty years. It will be necessary for a little attention to be paid to that provvision

                    <para>- Before this clause is postponed, I should like to make a statement which will probably save discussion at a later stage. I made an interjection, during the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to the effect that in New South Wales owners of property are allowed to exercise the privilege or right of erecting telegraph or telephone lines on their own properties and for their own purposes only. If the clause in question is passed either as it stands in the Bill or with the amendment proposed by the Postmaster-General, the effect will be to immediately enable the postal authorities to come in and erect expensive lines for carrying on work which is being satisfactorily carried on at a minimum cost to them. The Postmaster-General might either himself erect wires, or might compel owners to enter into a contract with him. The clause as it stands says that the Post.master-General may enter into a contract with any other person. </para>

                        <para>- It has not been done: In hundreds of cases they are working on their own fences or on lines which answer their purpose, although such lines might not meet with the approval of the Postal department. They are doing so without any reference to the department. There is a difference in affirming that the management in these matters should rest in the hands of the State and in giving the Government right to interfere where a line crosses a road. I submit that it is quite sufficient for the purposes of public safety in the case of a line on private property that the Postmaster-General should have authority to supervise that portion of it which happens to cross a road. As long as he has ample authority to see that the means for carrying the line across or under the road are sufficient for the purposes of public safety, that is all that is necessary. </para>

                    <para>- If this matter is not dealt with by the Public Service Bill I think it should be. It is clearly a question which1 comes within the scope of that measure, and certainly it should be dealt with by the commissioner or the chief officer, as he may be called. I do not think it would be advisable to put it in this clause. There is a great deal of difficulty surrounding it, because it would be necessary to have a different regulation in each State. It depends to a very great extent on what is the school age in each of the States. If we are going to take young boys into the service as messengers, we should take them as soon as they are fit for the work and as soon as they have passed the school age. I would not be a party to doing anything which would take a boy away from school during the time that he should be there according to the law of the State. I would do all I possibly could, however, to insure that as soon as he was done with his schooling he should be employed. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - While I am anxious to clip the powers given by these regulations to the Postmaster-General,
                    seems desirous of enlarging them very seriously. I would suggest to the honorable senator that, he might very well allow his amendment to stand over and try to deal with it when the Public Service Bill comes before us. It is undesirable in my opinion that we should give the Postmaster-General, whoever he may be, power to decide as to the age at which any person shall be employed in the service.

                    <para>- It will be found that in clauses 64 and 66 vessels are required to ' deliver and take delivery of mails at the wharf nearest to the post-office. Under this paragraph, however, the Minister has sole power to fix rates for carrying such mails. I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that it would be better to have a schedule of rates for carriage of mail matter, the department taking delivery from and giving delivery to a vessel wherever she may be lying. Under this law the department could deliver mails anywhere. That would be very inconvenient. The suggestion I have made comes from the Chamber of Commerce. </para>

We provide in a previous clause that where the Postmaster-General cannot agree with the railway authorities the matter shall be determined by arbitration. This clause, however, definitely gives the Postmaster-General the power to fix rates and to make the carriers accept any rates he may fix. </para>

                        <para>- I really do not think we want this provision. It must be a matter of private bargain and the rates must differ in every case. The Postmaster-General cannot fix rates arbitrarily as far as they relate to private railways and vessels. If he cannot do it arbitrarily, and if the carriers have the right of arbitration and will not accept the rates we are willing to give, what is the use of this paragraph ? I do not think we want this power. This proposal appears to me to be useless, because unless they are willing to accept the rates the power will never be acted upon. </para>

                        <para>- We have already decided that ships must carry the mails at prescribed rates, and this provision gives the power to fix those rates. With regard to State or private railways, we have passed a clause providing that mails must be carried by private arrangement if possible, as to the amount to be paid, and if not the amount to be paid must be fixed by arbitration. We must have the power in that case by regulation to fix the rates we will offer in the first place. We will have a regulation stating what we are prepared to pay for the carriage of mails by railway, and if the State concerned is not prepared to carry the mails at that rate then the matter is to be referred to arbitration. But I think we should have the power, in the first place, to prescribe a uniform rate for the Commonwealth. </para>

                    Ships may have to carry mails, and we cannot enforce a uniform rate that will be fair to all. Under the circumstances, I think we had better strike out this provision altogether. . In both cases we shall have to make a definite offer to people, which they can accept or reject, as they think fit; but if we fix the rates payable to masters of vessels, the Postmaster-General may deliberately say to those people that they must accept the rates offered. If these rates, fixed as proposed, are to be subject to arbitration subsequently, we ought to say so definitely in the clause, but if they are to be fixed rates, then they will be the only rates which the Postmaster-General will agree to pay.

Under clause 15 the Postmaster-General may enter into arrangements with shipping companies, trading vessels between centres of population, frequently and regularly; and in the same way he may make arrangements with railway authorities carrying mails between large centres of population. But the part of clause 91, which we are now discussing, deals with a different set of circumstances. Take, for instance, the case of vessels going from </para>

                        <para>- In any way it does not remove the difficulty pointed out by me, for this reason, that when a clause says that contracts may be made, it implies, if we are going to have mails carried in any of these exceptional cases, we must have the rate fixed by contract, and if we have a regulation fixing them anterior to the possibility of any contract, then either the contractual section must go or this section must go. So I think that if we are to give effect to the preceding clause we should strike out this sub-clause. I move - </para>

If we said, "by arrangement with the owners, or by arrangement with the parties concerned," it would give the Postmaster-General the power to compel the carriage of mails. He should make such arrangements as he could with them, and really he would be fixing the rates with their consent, and the clauses dealing with arbitration, where it was impossible for him to fix the rates, could be applied in this instance as well as any other. </para>

                        <para>- I think that for the carriage of mails by land or sea the Minister has to enter into a contract, and he proposes, if it is not already in, to add some words' with regard to arbitration. The clause to which I refer was postponed in order to allow of an addition dealing with arbitration in the event of disagreement, the same as applies to a disagreement between the Minister and the railway authority. There are two clauses providing that the method of payment and the rate of payment shall be the outcome of an agreement, and, failing an agreement, of arbitration. And yet here we are going to fix rates which will have the force of law, and which will really have the effect of overloading the provisions of the clause we have passed. We must define our position. Surely either we are going to treat the owners of these railways, including State railways, and the owners of steam-ships in an arbitrary manner, and say "You shall carry for the rates which we say are reasonable," or we must treat them as contracts. Which are we going to do? We have already decided to treat them as contracts, and if we pass this clause giving the Postmaster-General the power to make regulations, we shall absolutely rob the previous clauses of the whole of their effect, and make him the person who is to decide the rates at which this work shall be done. </para>

It will not meet the case which these regulations are contemplated to deal with, because it contemplates a contract being entered into, and with the contract there must be a mutual agreement by the two parties. But we take power beyond that to compel the master of any vessel to carry mails. There is a provision in clause 66 that the master of any ship is to carry mails if it becomes necessary for postal purposes. This would simply be in isolated cases where it would not suit the </para>

                    (Western Australia). - What . I was going to suggest was that instead of retaining the word " fixing," we ought to say " providing for the rates to be paid to masters." That would leave the Minister all the power, and it would not fix anything. Clause 67 gives power to prescribe rates, and this provision would enable him to make the necessary regulations. If we omit the words " private railway," it would come to the same thing, because the. matter is open with reference to ships.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - We vest in the Minister compulsory power to enjoin that all casual mails shall be carried, and if some rates are not fixed by regulation it is undoubtedly as he may determine at the time ; otherwise the unfortunate ship-owner will get nothing. I was going to suggest, to make it still clearer and to avoid the difficulty with regard to mails under contract, that we should insert some such words as "for the occasional or casual carriage of mails." It has been suggested that there should be some provision added to clause 15 with regard to arbitrations in connexion with contracts. It is obvious that that would never do. Clause 15 deals with the powers of the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts, and to provide that he could not fix a rate by contract if the other party disagreed without entering into an . arbitration would be a new way of making a bargain. Clause 91 deals with a different matter altogether. It relates to what may be called the emergency carriage of mails - that is, with cases where there is no contract entered into. An amendment such as I have suggested would differentiate quite clearly as to the inapplicability of this to contracts, and show what was meant, namely, that this was a power vested in the Postmaster-General, by means of which he would be able to put a mail on board a ship which was going to an island at an odd or. occasional time, and would enable him to fix a rate of payment per pound of mail matter.

He might insert the words "Fixing the rates payable under sections 66 and 67." Those clauses contemplate extraordinary as distinct from regular contracts. It should be made clear that this power does not apply to those cases where contracts are going to be entered into.

If the rates are arbitrarily fixed, the clause as it stands might have the effect of over-riding the rates fixed by contract. It is safer to make the amendment.

In the United States of America mail contracts are not made, but the Postmaster-General takes advantage of any vessel that is going to any port, and puts the mails on board that vessel, which carries them at a fixed rate. I think the charge is so much per letter. I anticipate that in a few years' time the Postmaster-General of Australia will be in a position to make some such arrangement as that.

                        <para>- It seems to me that honorable senators, for the sake of altering the verbiage of the Bill, are making changes which will lead to the Postmaster-General finding himself in a nice fix by-and-by. No doubt this provision has been properly considered by the department, and has been drafted by competent legal authorities. Some of the amendments may have a very prejudicial effect. I do not think the Postmaster-General should allow these alterations to be made unless he is fully satisfied that there is no objection to them. </para>

                        <para>- It depends on what a private telephone line is. In Queensland lines have been erected by the Government for private individuals who pay for them, and an arrangement has been made that if the general public wish to use those lines a charge may be imposed. The persons who paid for the construction of the lines get so much of the revenue so derived, while the rest goes to the department. </para>

                    <para>- I think there has been a misunderstanding as to what the term "private telephone" means. It appears to me that we shall not have much difficulty in arriving at a solution of this and the previous question. If the Postmaster-General means that it is necessary for the State to have some supervision over private telephones connected with main trunk lines, that is all right; but if he means that a charge is to be made for a private telephone on the property of the person who uses it, then I think such power should not be given. </para>

                    ZEAL (Victoria). - This provision has been framed as the result of practical experience. Let us consider a case in which it would be necessary. Suppose, for example, a man had a very large estate, and wished to establish telephonic communication between the homestead and the railway station, it might be necessary for such a line to cross three or four public roads, and to pass close to a township. If this clause were eliminated and the Government had no power over private telephones the department might be confronted with opposition from that private telephone line. The owner would be able to collect fees and the department would suffer. Where a man has a telephone on his own property, and it crosses no road whatever, this clause would not apply. It is .simply framed to protect the department against the designs of unscrupulous men. If the committee is not careful in making these alterations, the department will be faced with great difficulties and the Bill will be practically unworkable.

                    (New South Wales).The point raised by the honorable senator is that the clause is necessary because of the liability to fraud, lt must be remembered, however, that fraud is liable everywhere under existing conditions.

                    <para>- I would ask the Postmaster-General whether it would not be possible for him under this Bill to allow a person to construct a telephone line on condition that the public be permitted to use it on certain terms. For instance, a tramway company might be allowed to construct a line along its tramway, and the department might see fit, under this Bill, to impose a condition that the public should be allowed to use it on payment of certain charges. If we put in here the words " or for the use of a private telephone by the public " that would make some sense of the thing. Then it would read- </para>

                    <para>- I happen to be connected with several telephone lines, and amongst others with one at Barringgun, on the border of Queensland and on the Warrago. We have gone to great expense in building that line, a distance of 25 miles. Of course we facilitate business going to the office. We do not object to that. We send innumerable telegrams which would not otherwise be sent. We save the shareholders money,and God knows they want it ! I would support the Government in every way by protecting and increasing the revenue, but in the case of a telephone which is entirely a private affair, a line merely from one portion to another portion of the same holding, and having no connexion whatever with the Telegraph department, I should expect that we should not be handicapped by any Government. </para>

                        <para>- A contract for the provision of uniforms, such as would be necessary under this Bill. Again, take the construction of post-offices. Subletting has been rife in Government contracts of this description. The result of men working at starvation rates of wages is that work is " slummed," and although the Government, that is the people, had paid a high price for the building, still they did not get value for the money. It went to those who had sublet the contract My sub-clause will have the effect of compelling the men who do the work to pay a fair rate of wages, and observe proper working conditions, and under that term we understand the abolition of subletting. As regards the latter part of the sub-clause, there is nothing very revolutionary in the idea of asking the committee to recognise the trade union rate of wages for a district as the standard rate of wages. In all their contracts the London County Council have a provision similar to that in the sub-clause, and they recognise that the standard rate of wages for the district is the trade union rate of wages for that district. I think I can safely ask honorable senators to follow the example of such an august body as the London County Council, who have found it necessary and desirable, in the interests of ratepayers as well as the workers, to insert such a provision in their contracts. </para>

                        <para>- It is the duty of trades unions to enforce this principle. If the Minister has a provision to this effect in a contract, the trade union of the district will take very good care that it is adhered to. If a contract is being carried out in a district, and this provision is not adhered to, the trade union will soon acquaint the Minister with the fact. Let me give an instance which will bring home to honorable senators not only the need for the provision, but the way in which it would operate. We had a large post-office built in Kalgoorlie. There was a recognised trade union rate of wages for the district. The contractor for the building competed with the contractors of Kalgoorlie. They based their price on a certain rate of wages ; he based his price on a lower rate, and of course he got the contract. He immediately went down to Perth, where a lower rate was paid, and contracted with men to go up and work for the Perth rate of wages. He did not get a superior class of workmen. Not only did he get an inferior class, but he also sublet some portions of the . contract. He could not get sufficient men to carry out the work faithfully. The building hung fire for a long time. The department was put to all sorts of inconvenience, and the people were inconvenienced too. An injustice was done to the contractors of Kalgoorlie, and the people of the State had to pay a large price for the building; and owing to the sub-contracting a number of people made a profit out of the State without giving it any value therefor. The trade union made a stir about the matter. They waited on the Public Works department, but the commissioner said to them - "I am helpless; there is no provision in my department to give me power to interfere with the contractor." </para>

                        <para>- No. Under the Act the Minister will enter into contracts for the provision of uniforms for his officers and the supply of telegraphic material, and we are asking that in such contracts there shall be inserted, by regulation, certain clauses providing that fair rates of wages shall be paid and fair working conditions observed. Surely there is nothing sensational or out of the way in such a provision as that. </para>

                        <para>- We have been interfering with trade in various ways throughout the Bill. The owners of steam-ships who carry mails are interfered with. We have made greater interferences with trade by means of clauses that have been agreed to, than would be made by the proposal I am now making. By passing the amendment the Senate will not be committing itself to the details, which however would have to come before the Senate in the form of regulations. Therefore, for the purpose of insuring the conditions under which contracts shall be carried out for the Commonwealth Government, I ask the Senate to agree to the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- But look at the machinery that would have to be provided. Senators who have had experience of the working of factory legislation in Victoria, in Queensland, or in other States know that an enormous amount of machinery is required. I do not see how in any State where there is no factory law we can introduce regulations which will practically mean enacting factory laws. </para>

                    Of course, I quite agree that this amendment is in accordance with the protectionist policy of the Government ; but I do not at all agree with the Postmaster-General as to the difficulty of carrying out the idea. I am satisfied that a minimum or trade union rate of wages can very well be provided by means of this Bill, and can be carried out by the Postal department. This can be done even in the case of the carriage of mails and where there is no carriers union in existence. I am proud to say that in Western Australia there is a union amongst the road men on the Murchison gold-fields. I think the movement has extended to the eastern gold-fields. The men have been forced into this position through the fact of Afghan carriers nearly running them off the roads. As to the carriage of mails, where there is no trades union the difficulty can be easily got over by having a schedule of rates and by providing that no rates shall be paid short of, say, 7½ per cent. of the rate fixed in the schedule. Unless something of that kind is done the sweating that has been in existence hitherto will be continued. I know of contracts that have been taken at rates that were not sufficient to pay for the feed of the horses.

                        <para>- Where there is not enough to pay a living rate of wages, or even to pay for the feed of the horses, it is only proper that the State should step in and fix a living rate. We have seen cases where a firm like Cobb and Co., have had a monopoly over certain roads, and been able to run other firms off the road, after which they have raised the prices and made the business pay at their own terms. There are also cases where contracts have been taken from the Government at very low rates, and the shortage has been made up by compelling passengers to pay through the nose. It is not fair that the post-office should get the benefit of having its mails carried at the expense of passengers. Those are difficulties which can be rectified by fixing a schedule rate. The principle is one that a protectionist Government is pledged to so thoroughly that they cannot consistently oppose it. </para>

                        <para>- My experience is that we often go too slow, and sometimes stop short of the distance we ought to reach. We are all agreed that persons doing the work of the Commonwealth should be reasonably paid ; that no sweating should take place, and I would urge the Postmaster-General to set his face against subcontracting in every shape and form. It is an evil, and will continue to be so as long as the system is permitted to exist. I trust the Postmaster-General will provide against it by regulation. The carriage of mails is a more difficult matter to deal with. A person contracting for their delivery in a certain place might simply be a horseman, who would do the work himself. It would not be desirable for the committee to assert that where such a man contracted to carry the mails over a certain distance for £100 a year, the Postmaster-General should say to him - " Friend, I think the price is too little ; you ought to get £200." But where a mail contractor employs another person to assist him in carrying out that work, we ought to insist that a reasonable wage is paid. Let us take Cobb and Co. for example. Why should they not be required to pay a reasonable wage to their coach-drivers ? Provision has been made for a minimum wage in many parts of the world. The London County Council has adopted the system, and a minimum wage is provided for bus-drivers and tram-drivers. Would there be anything unseasonable, therefore, in framing regulations to compel Cobb and Co. and other people to pay a fair wage. What we want to provide is that the rate of wage shall be in accordance with that fixed by the union in the particular locality in which the work is done, if such a union exists. We could provide for a case in which a union did not exist by saying that such a rate should be paid wherepracticable. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I am heartily in accord with
                    intentions in this matter. 1 do not think there is an honorable senator who holds two opinions about the desirability of seeing that a fair and reasonable wage is paid to the people of this country. I am perfectly certain that we shall do all that lies in our power to insure that, whenever contracts are entered into with the Commonwealth, the persons working under those contracts are paid an honest and reasonable wage. It seems to me, however, that by including the provision in this clause we should be arrogating to the Postmaster-General and the trades unions that which is clearly the province of conciliation and arbitration boards.

                        <para>- I think I am just as free to speak on this question as the honorable leader of the labour party. I am just as fully in accord with the principle as he is. It is not necessary for an honorable senator to be a member of the labour party in order to be just as warmly in accord with the principles that are advocated in this amendment, as any member of that party is. We have recognised in most of the States of the Commonwealth the principle of conciliation and arbitration, and I hope that in the very near future we shall have a Commonwealth Act dealing with those disputes which arise outside any particular State. The Arbitration and Conciliation Board in Western Australia, say, might fix a wage at a particular amount which, in the opinion of trades unionists, would not be a fair rate. </para>

                        <para>- There is one in Western Australia. I am heartily in accord with the honorable senator's intentions in putting forward this proposal, and when a Bill in which we can deal with this matter is brought forward I shall be prepared to assist him. The amendment refers to the rate of wages " payable in the locality." In what locality ? Suppose a contract is to be entered into for the carriage of the mails from Perth to Kalgoorlie, or from Perth to Mount Leonora. What rate of wages is to be paid ? The rate of wages is far lower at Perth than at Kalgoorlie. Or, take the case suggested by a senator of a steamer trading between London and Australia. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I only wish to make a few remarks. I suppose I ought to say, like the Postmaster-General and the last speaker, that I am in entire accord with the sentiments of the mover of the amendment. I am always in accord with a proposal which has for its object the bettering of the labouring classes. At the same time I am very often not in accord with the proposals of those who say they want to benefit the labouring classes, because I have frequently observed that the opinions of certain classes are entirely opposed to what -would be in their true interests. This proposal appears to me to provide that we should make regulations for incorporating the minimum rate of wage and fair working condition into any contract that is entered into in connexion with postal affairs. I can well understand that that would be practicable if, in all the States, we had in existence legislation dealing with the minimum wage and providing for fair working conditions, because then it would be equivalent to saying that any contract entered into by the Postmaster-General must be carried out in accordance with the State legislation on the subject then existing. But supposing we have no factory laws, what then, is the Postmaster-General to do ? Is he, by his regulations, to have cut and dry a Factory Bill that has never been passed in a State ? Take Queensland, where there are. jio factory laws.

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that, but by this provision the Government would have power to secure fail conditions and the minimum rate of wages in the building of a post-office, and such conditions should not apply to only one class of work, but to all works carried out in the States. We are here putting into this measure a provision for the application of certain conditions to one class of work that really ought to be applicable to every class of work done in the States. Assuming, which I am not, that I was in favour of the fair minimum wage and fair conditions, as here referred to, my argument is that this proposal is asked to be put into the wrong Bill. It is asked to be put into a Commonwealth measure, whereas it should be dealt with by a State measure in each particular State. That is all I have to say, except that I am sure Senators Pearce and McGregor must feel, from the kindly way I have addressed myself to the subject, that I am heartily in accord with the principle contained in the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- That, to my mind is the same thing, because you can put in a clause in the contract requiring that the ruling rate of wages shall be paid. I think the Federal Government, as large employers of labour, should certainly set an example by paying at any rate the ruling rate of wages. </para>

                        <para>- To my mind it is precisely the same thing. If we let a contract for uniforms, for instance, have we not the right to say before we conclude the contract that the people to whom we let the contract shall pay the ruling rate of wages ? It is an extraordinary thing to me if we have not that right. We have precedents for that in many contracts which have been let by Governments before, in which it has been stipulated that the ruling rate of wages shall be paid. This provision may not be necessary in Victoria, where there is a Factories Act in existence, but some other States have not had the courage to initiate a Factories Act, and in order to obtain a trade advantage they may be very reluctant 'to do so. In such a case where a contract is let for uniforms, I do not see why a clause should not be inserted to provide that the trade union rate of wages shall be paid to the persons engaged in making the uniforms. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any trades union in a case like that ; but if Cobb and Company are tendering for the carriage of mails they should tender under the same conditions as a man who is a fair employer, and thus not put a fair man at a disadvantage, compared with a man who will cut down wages, and consequently get the contract. If there be any contract there is no injustice done. The Postmaster-General says, "would you ask me to accept a tender for £200 if there is a tender for £150 "? Certainly not ; he would accept the lower tender, but the tenderers would have to . comply with the same condition, to pay the full rate of wage. I hope that in this Bill, as in every other where we are going to have contracts or employes, a similar provision will be inserted. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I. am very pleased that an opportunity of this description has arisen to afford time for consideration, and also to give those honorable senators who are so fond of preaching to put into practice a little of that precept which they advocate so much. It has been said by some honorable senators that they have as much sympathy with the working men as- t has the labour party or its leader, or anybody else. I do not deny that. Probably they have as much sympathy as the others. But then, so far as this discussion has gone,, their sympathy is not of a very practicable description. Even the Postmaster-General has a great deal of sympathy. Undoubtedly we believe that he feels that sympathy, but when he stated that he was sympathetic, he immediately began to put out a great many obstacles that were in the way of its. realization.
                    too, is in entire sympathy with the proposal. In fact he has more sympathy than any of us here who occupy this corner, and he is- better capable of judging as to what would be really beneficial to the people whom we are here especially to represent. Although we consider that we are as good representatives of all sections of the community as any one here, yet the very name we bear gives us a special claim lathe representation of the working classes..

                        <para>- I shall tell the Minister how he would -see. The girls - knowing that he had made these conditions, had such sympathy with them, and was so fond of carrying out these principles, and was such a fine good-looking gentleman - would soon indicate to him the delinquencies of the employer under whom they were working. The Postmaster-General raises the objection - are we to employ inspectors ? Well, I have worked on a great many Government jobs, both for private contractors and the Government themselves, but I never worked upon a job which the Government did not inspect in order to see whether the work was being carried out properly. Does the Postmaster-General mean to tell the committee that he would let a contract for the manufacture of some thousands of pounds' worth of .uniforms, that they would be dumped into the department, and that no one would ever see whether they were properly made, or whether the material was of good quality ? </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of clothing contracts. The Postmaster-General will have to call for tenders for clothing for a great number of officers of his department. Is it not better for the individuals who have to earn their living in carrying out those contracts that some conditions should be laid down as to whether they are to work eight or fifteen hours a day, and are to get the recognised log prices ? If the Postmaster-General knows anything about labour conditions he must be aware that in almost every city in Australia there is in connexion with the tailoring trade a log of prices according to an agreement made between employers and employes. Would it be a hardship if the Postmaster-General were to insert a condition in his contracts with manufacturers of clothing that the recognised log prices should be paid to those engaged upon the contract? </para>

                        <para>- But the Postal department, as the saying is, will generally go " on its own." We find that that is the case in other States. It will be safer to insert the provision in this Bill. It can do no harm, and will only be in accordance with the resolution passed in another place. Therefore I hope the committee will agree to the amendment, and that instead of merely expressing their sympathy, senators will give practical effect to it by doing something for the good employers who are willing to treat their fellow-creatures fairly, as well as for those individuals for whom so much sympathy is expressed. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria).. -
                    has credited me with this amendment.
                    doubted very much whether it emanated from me, and I think that the honorable senator's surprise was justified, because when T do propose an amendment I like to propose a practical one. In this instance I do not think the amendment is practicable. Several honorable' senators have stated that their sympathies are in the direction of this proposal. I can say the same. I can also lay claim to the fact that I had charge of the first Factories Act in Victoria during its passage through, the Upper House. I have carefully watched the progress of factory legislation, and have taken a very active interest in every amendment of the original Act in Victoria. I am a thorough believer in legislation of that kind in the interests not merely of the employer but also of the employe, and without factory laws of a wise character I believe the condition- of affairs that has been referred to would have been continued up to the present day. The Victorian Act has done a great deal of good, although it is by no means perfect. But for the fact of that law being in existence here, the very desirable object which the proposer of this amendment has in view could not be carried out even in Victoria. The difficulty will be in applying it under this Bill in other States where they have no factory legislation. I have been a manufacturer for forty years, and I am a manufacturer now, so that I think I may safely say that I know something of the subject under discussion. I- have always made ib a rule to secure the sen-ices of good workmen and to pay them well, and during the whole of my career as a manufacturer I have never had the slightest difficulty with an)' of my employes. I may safely say that, directly and ind directly, I have over 5, 800 employes, so that I may reasonably claim to have had some experience upon these questions. I entirely agree with the strong condemnation of subletting, which was indulged in by
                    That has been the root of a great deal of the evil which has taken place, and no measure would be too strong to absolutely put an end to it. Another portion of the amendment is really an acceptance of the principle of the minimum wage. That subject has been debated for many years, and very recently the principle has been recognised in the State of Victoria. Speaking as much in the interests of the employe as that of the employer, I must say we do not know yet what the ultimate result of it will be. In my opinion it is a step in the right direction, but undoubtedly one of its results has been to throw out of employment the old and indifferent workers.

                        <para>- Unfortunately the result of the minimum wage in Victoria has been to throw a number of old men out of work. That difficulty is met by a special clause inserted in the Victorian Act by the Legislative Council, I may say, very much against the will of the labour party. The clause provides that special permits shall be given in those cases where men are not able to make themselves worthy of the full rate of pay. It is rather an unsatisfactory position for old men who have been working for many years for their employer, but it is the only way in which it is possible for the minimum wage to be carried out. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I should have much preferred to see this motion brought forward apart from the Postal Bill, but as it has been tabled, and as my sympathies with it will cany me a little further than the sympathies of other honorable senators appear to have carried them, I am anxious to make a suggestion the acceptance of which would enable me to vote for it. I have listened very carefully to the objections that have been raised, and I must admit that many of them are the result of fear or imagination. I have heard similar objections raised with regard to nearly every reform dealing with social and industrial legislation. Nevertheless, I think I can see one or two objections to the adoption of the amendment in its entirety. It makes two distinct proposals. The first is that in all contracts under the Postal department provision shall be made for the payment of a fair rate of wage and for fair working conditions. I agree absolutely with that. I see no objection to requiring the Postal department to insure that being done, and I see little difficulty in maintaining that position. When it goes on to stipulate, however, how we are to ascertain these conditions, I think it creates a difficulty. I do not wish to see the Postmaster-General made a. party to a strike,- for instance, and yet if we adopt the amendment in its present form we might under these regulations force him to take sides in an industrial dispute. There is no necessity for that. Let me illustrate what I. mean. Supposing trouble occurred with the railway employes, and they, through their union, demanded a higher rate of wages- than they were receiving. The mails have to be carried ; they could not be stopped pending the adjustment of this trouble. What, then, would be the position of the Postmaster-General ? He insists, under this Bill, that the mail's shall be carried, but, in the event of a dispute, the railway authorities might perhaps be forced to say that they must stop the running of their trains rather than concede the demands of the men. In such an event, what would the Postmaster-General have to do ? Should he say " You are to pay the rate of wages which the union demands, and not the rate previously given" ? Yet such a difficulty would possibly occur not only in regard to railways, but in relation to the carriage of mails by other means. I would, therefore, ask the proposer of the amendment to omit -the last lines, altering the word "minimum" to " reasonable," and making the paragraph read - '
                </para>
                <para>For the purpose of providing for the payment of a reasonable rate of wages and fair working conditions in all contracts under this Act. </para>
                <para>That is not only an affirmation of the broad principle that in the carrying out of the department's work we wish to treat fairly those who are discharging that work, but it brings the machinery into play by which the regulations can be enforced. It certainly would throw upon the Postmaster-General occasionally the difficult task of determining whether the wages were fair or not, but in 99 cases out of 100 he would adopt the union rate. It would also relieve hun from the obligation of taking sides if such trouble as that to which I have referred did occur. If the suggestion I have made is adopted, or something in that direction, I shall be prepared to give the motion my vote, as I now give.it my cordial support. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I wish to add a word or two in regard to the question of the inspection of uniforms in course of manufacture, to which reference has been made.
                    Sargood, who has had large experience in these matters, says there is no such thing as inspection of clothing in the process of manufacture. That we may take as a fact. Assuming, however, that the post-office insists upon inspection, does it follow that it will be necessary to have an inspector travelling from place to place ? I do not think so. I think the difficulty can be overcome very easily. Supposing that a contract for the manufacture qf uniforms for the postal authorities of Victoria is let, could not the Postmaster-General arrange for some person who is particularly well up in this kind of work to superintend the manufacture of the uniforms at a moderate fee ? Where is the difficulty ? The income tax in the old country is collected by local people, who are thoroughly conversant with the various persons and matters in their respective localities. In Queensland, which is an enormous territory with a sparse population, the contracts for these uniforms are usually let in Brisbane. The clothing is manufactured according to measurement and sent to postal employes all over the State. I was in the Postal department at Brisbane for a little while, and know something about the matter. I am acquainted with a number of contractors in Brisbane who have made uniforms for the Railway department, the Postal department, and for the police, and I can say that there would be no difficulty in obtaining a thoroughly competent person in any of the large centres to see that the uniforms are properly made. Their services could be obtained for a very small fee, so that so far as the appointment of travelling inspectors is concerned there need be no anxiety over it at all, and it simply wants a little arrangement. In the way I suggest we may easily overcome any difficulty in the way of inspection. If we have a desire to put these very humane provisions into force we will find that the difficulties raised will vanish into thin air when we come to the practical working of the question.

                    (Western Australia). - I was encouraged to bring forward this amendment by the fact that the Government so readily agreed to a motion, submitted by
                    in another place, which' embodied the principle. It has, therefore, been a surprise to me to meet with opposition from the Government. If we cannot put the principle into operation in connexion with this department of the Government, I do not know in what department we can put it into operation. Here we have a Postal Act in which the Postmaster-General has power to contract with certain parties for the supply of material, and all we are asking is that in the supply of  that material the Government shall require contractors to carry out the spirit of the resolution they have already agreed to in another place. We want the Government to be consistent. They have said in another place that they are prepared to stipulate that a fair rate of wages shall be paid, and we are now asking them in this Bill, under which contracts may be made, to carry out the spirit of that resolution. As to the practicability of this proposal, that the Government, in framing regulations under this Bill, will so frame them . as to insure their practicable working. We do not by this motion, frame regulations, but I do not see why regulations cannot be framed which will make it practicable. I do not see anything to be gained by the adoption of the alteration suggested by
                    If we alter the expression " minimum " to " reasonable " we must call, in some one to determine what is " reasonable." As to saying trade unions laid down the rate of wages in certain districts, as is frequently said, the fact is that the trades unions or employers and employes together fix the wages. It is an agreement between employers and employes, and if it is suggested that a strike may arise in the meantime, that will not concern the Postmaster-General, as all he will have to do will be to see that the conditions of his contract are carried out.

                        <para>- They would be able to do so by agreement with their employers, but the Postmaster-General would not be placed in the position of deciding between the employer and the employe. All that he would have to do would be to see that the contract was carried out according to the conditions. As to the appointment of inspectors to see that this proposal is carried out, in dealing with that matter, I do not want to say that senators have shown a want of common sense, but they have shown a want of knowledge of the way in which these contracts are carried., out. If they had worked upon such contracts, as I have done, they would know that those who are at work upon them would be the inspectors to see the conditions carried out. </para>

                        <para>- It would not matter what the class of work was. If it was a clothing contract the tailors or tailoresses union would see that if the contract was being violated the matter would be brought before the Trades Council, and steps taken to have the provisions of the contract complied with. We do not ask that an army of inspectors should be appointed ; but I point out, at the same time, that in the case of buildings we do appoint inspectors to look after the work and see that we get good material from the time the foundation is laid, and I do not see why we should not be just as willing, if necessary, to appoint inspectors in connexion with other kinds of work. As regards the question of arbitration, it seems to me that this proposal would be perfectly compatible with the Arbitration Act. As regards the question of locality and the payment of the rate of wages ruling in the locality in the case of the carriage of mails between Australia and the United Kingdom, the contract, I suppose, would be made in the United .Kingdom, and in that case it would recognise the rate of wages paid in the United Kingdom as the rate of wages to be stipulated. I trust that the fact of this motion having emanated from this corner of the House will not procure for it any opposition on that ground alone. </para>

                        <para>- The impracticability has already been pointed out, and I need not take up time by repeating what has been said already by my honorable friend the Postmaster-General and other senators. There are innumerable difficulties in the way. What we impress upon honorable senators at the present time is, that where we are dealing with specific contracts the Government have bound themselves already to deal with them on the principles I have mentioned ; but I say it is impossible to frame this Bill in such a way that those principles can be made applicable practically to the varying conditions of the different States and the necessarily varying conditions of the different contracts. I say that it is quite impracticable ; and while we must refuse to accept this amendment, I state as clearly as it can be stated, that the Government are not in any way departing from the principle affirmed by the Prime Minister, and which they will carry out on every occasion in regard to these contracts. </para>

                    <para>- I have no doubt that this amendment is proposed by honorable senators with the full idea that it will be a desirable thing in the interests of the people whom they represent. At the same time there is underlying the amendment a principle which I think requires very careful consideration before the committee pledges itself to accept a doctrine of this character. Unquestionably it is the duty of the Government at all times to pay a fail- and reasonable wage to any men who may bc in their employment. So far as I can judge, that is the intention Of the present Administration, and 1 have no doubt that any future Administration will be actuated in exactly the same way. But when honorable senators look at the amendment they will, find that it is practically taking a certain amount of power out of the hands of the Government, and enabling another body to dictate to them what the rate of wages ought to be for services that are rendered to the Commonwealth. </para>

If the Government do not see fit to pay a fair and reasonable rate of wages, I am perfectly prepared to join with other senators to insist upon such a thing being done. But I do object to any outside body - an irresponsible body so far as the people of the country are concerned - dictating to the Government of the Commonwealth, or to any Government, what rate of wages shall be paid. </para>

I will take a case where the Government give some employment for the purpose of building a post-office, and I do not think that is barking up the wrong tree. In that case the Government have no right to be dictated to by any special body in the community, whether they belong to a trade union or to any other association. It is the principle of the amendment entirely that I object to. I do not object to men forming a trade union, and saying that they will not work under a certain rate of wages. </para>

                        <para>- A great many things may be done. The honorable senator knows very well, and other senators here know, that when unions attempt to get an unreasonable rate of wages, employers will not pay them, but will resist and will not pay a single- penny more than they can help. No union rate of wages can be recognised as a standard rate which has not been acceded to by the employers. Consequently, when the honorable and learned senator is so learnedly talking about trades unionists, he must recognise that the employers' union is a trades union, and that a rate of wages that has been adopted and recognised by the trade union composed of workmen, and the trade union composed of employers-- </para>

                    <para>- I am very pleased, to hear so many honorable senators give in their adhesion to the principles contained in the amendment. At the same time I regret exceedingly that so many of them have expressed their inability to vote for it. It seems to me - if I may so put it - that a great many of the arguments which have been adduced by those who are opposed to the amendment are based upon a misconception of its purport and effect. It would appear that many honorable senators think that the mover of the amendment is desirous of incorporating in the Bill something which is hard and rigid, and which the Postmaster-General, in administering the Act, may find it difficult to give practical effect to in certain circumstances and in certain cases. But, after all, if we look at the clause, we find that it reads - </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The amendment is intended to apply to contracts entered into with individual contractors, and will have the effect of preventing any unscrupulous contractor who would be inclined to sweat his men from doing so, and from securing an advantage over those who were prepared to pay such reasonable wages as were being paid in the district at the time the contract was entered into. </para>

                    has attempted to prove the necessity for this amendment, but has really proved more than I presume he anticipated. If" his words are of any effect at all, he would provide that the conditions of labour, and the rates of wages recognised by trades unions in the various localities in which works are to be carried out, shall be recognised both by the contractors' unions, if there be such unions, and by the workmen's unions. That means that those conditions and wages must be agreed upon both by the contractors and unions of workmen.

                        <para>- It may ; but it cuts more against the amendment than in favour of it. If anything unfair is done in connexion with a contract it can be brought forward in this Senate. There are plenty of senators who are willing to bring forward any case of injustice; and have it remedied as speedily as possible. Until it is proved that there is an absolute necessity for such a provision as this, I do not see why we should insert it in the Bill at all. Therefore I am prepared to vote for rejecting the amendment altogether ; or if the supporters of it are prepared to say simply that there shall be provision made for the payment of a reasonable rate of wage, and for the imposition of reasonable conditions of labour, I shall not object to a provision of that character. </para>

The committee has already passed a clause compelling the Railways Commissioners of each State to carry mails. The Railways Commissioners will be contractors with the Commonwealth Government. If that b» the case, were we to pass the amendment now before the committee in its present form, the Commonwealth Government would not only have the right to require the use of the railways for the carriage of mails, but also the right to fix the rates of wages to be paid on the railways. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. There is no reference to regulations in this amendment. This is a distinct proposal that it shall be competent for the Postmaster-General to require certain rates of wages to be paid by contractors. I do not care who fixes them. It seems to me that we impose a double interference. First of all we say that the railways shall carry the mails and now we are asked to say that the Commonwealth Government shall fix the rates of wages to be paid to those who cany the mails upon the railways. A train may be carrying only half-a-dozen bags of mails, but this provision will compel the Commonwealth Government to fix wages for every one engaged upon that train. That is a serious difficulty. If the committee is determined to pass such an amendment I would venture to make a suggestion that would meet some difficulties that have been raised. I would suggest the introduction of the word "generally" before, the word "recognised," and would then omit the words " by trades unions." The clause would then read - </para>

                        <para>- At the same time, I do not think there is any necessity for the passing of this amendment, on the' ground that the Government have practically pledged themselves to carry out, if not the letter of it, certainly the essence of it. The Government have promised that in their contracts for public works they will do practically what this amendment asks them to do, except in regard to one or two particulars. The Government are connected with the post-office. It is all. very well for some senators to say that the post-office is in a different position to the public works branch. Nothing of the sort ! The post office is part of the Government, and any contracts carried out for the Postal department will have to be carried out in conformity with the rules and regulations made by the Government in respect to works in other departments. There will not, and cannot be, any difference. Therefore I think the senators who have moved in this matter may very well withdraw the amendment. There is no necessity for it, since, the Government having made a promise, the committee may feel perfectly sure that it will be carried out. The chances are that, unless it is found to work injuriously, no future Government will attempt to repeal the regulation. In South Australia we practically carry out the terms of this amendment, although we have no regulation or law bearing upon the matter. It is not to be found in any Act of Parliament what standard of wages shall be paid. But in practice we carry out the proposal. We have a minimum rate of wage in connexion with our Government contracts, and no man is allowed to receive less than 6s. a day if he is a common labourer. But if, through incapacity, ill-health, or infirmity, a man is not able to do the work of an able-bodied man, the contractor is allowed to pay him a lower rate of wages. That is perfectly proper, because men who cannot do a fair day's work should not be thrown upon the world to starve, but should be allowed to take such a wage as they can earn. The Government of South Australia have always recognised that principle. Any contractor, whether he be engaged upon railway works, telegraph works, or any works whatever in South Australia, has to pay a minimum rate of wages to all able-bodied men in his employment, but we make an honorable and. fair exception in the case of weaker men. who are not able to do an able-bodied man's work. </para>

                        <para>- It is a minimum wage as far as able-bodied men are concerned. It is not fair to lay down the hard and fast rule that every man shall be paid a certain wage. All men are not constituted alike, either physically or mentally, nor can you place all men in the same category. Therefore our Government have recognised, with the full consent of the trades unions of South Australia and of the working men's representatives in Parliament, that under certain circumstances less than the minimum may be paid where men are not capable of fairly earning the minimum wage. I do not think we should pass the amendment - in its present form, at any rate. I would strike out two things at least.. In the first place I would strike out. all reference to a minimum wage. Let the Government put that in their regulations if they like. In the second place I would strike out the reference to trades unions. It is a great mistake to say that the trades union rate shall be the rate paid. It might be that the trades union rate was not a fair rate in a certain neighbourhood. If those two provisions are struck out the amendment will read as follows - </para>

                    <para>- A number of honorable senators have pointed out that the proposal before the committee is impracticable; but I doubt even yet if the committee understands how thoroughly impracticable it is. There is no department of the Government so widely extended as the post-office. Our inland post-offices are in many cases hundreds of miles from any important centre. 1 suppose that out of ten contracts in connexion with post-offices which might be let by the Government, eight or nine at least would be for work in districts where there are positively no such things as trades unions, and where it would not be possible to carry out the terms of the amendment. The same remark applies to the construction of telegraph-lines, to contracts for the conveyance of mail matter along the inland mail routes, and also to the conveyance of letters by foreign and coastal vessels. There is altogether an absence of all power by which it would be possible to work the amendment. If the committee would grasp the position put by the Postmaster-General as to the absolute impossibility of carrying out the amendment, the discussion would be ended at once and the question resolved in the negative. </para>

Supposing someone complains that a mail contractor is paying 30s. a week, when he ought to pay . 35s.a week, who is to decide the point ? </para>

                        <para>- I think the Postmaster-General can easily do that when ne is in possession, as he may easily be, of the rates ruling in any locality in which he has work to be done. 1 am not at all particular how it is done, but it is our duty to see that the conditions of the people are according to their capacity for producing wealth. While we have control of these things it is right that we should stipulate that work done for the State shall be done under- conditions 'worthy of the nation to which we belong. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I must really go back to the imaginary difficulties again. Much has been said about the difficulty in letting a contract for the carriage of mails oversea from one end of the world to another. That point was raised by
                    Symon, who wished to know what rate could be fixed in such  a  case. Surely there is not much difficulty about that. If the' Postmaster-General enters into a contract with the P. and O. Company, the question to consider is, where the men working for that company sign articles.

                        <para>- Quite so ; but we are not going to stop at a few words, and there need be no two meanings in regard to this proposal. If the Postmaster-General enters into a contract with the shipping companies, whose men sign articles in Melbourne, the rate of wages will be those paid in this locality, and it will not follow that because the men on the ship carrying the mails go to other parts of the world they will have a different rate of wages when they are in those other parts of the world. What is there to hinder the Postmaster-General from saying, when letting a contract, that such and such wages shall be paid to the men engaged in carrying out the contract. </para>

                        <para>- We may be satisfied with that, but here we have the opportunity in regard to this particular department of inserting a minimum wage provision, and, although I am satisfied to a certain extent with what the Government have stated in another place, I want in this place to do my duty, and try, so far as I can, to give effect to the principle in this Bill. A good many difficulties have been raised. Honorable senators have asked how are we to find out the rate of wages which the Postmaster-General, or other Minister of the Crown, must pay for any particular class of labour % Such difficulties have not occurred elsewhere. In Victoria in all contracts that are let under the Government, the minimum wage principle is put in, and certainly if it can be done in regard to this State, it can be done in regard to Commonwealth contracts. I think there will be no difficulty whatever for the Postmaster-General to fix a minimum rate of wages which can be put in all Government contracts. </para>

A great many difficulties have been raised, lt appears to me that those difficulties are principally due to the fact that we have too many gentlemen of the long robe here. These honorable and learned senators are very useful when we have a fine constitutional point to discuss, and then they cannot agree, though that is in the game. When it comes to a question relating to the industrial life of Australia then they simply know nothing about it, and are of no practical assistance in our deliberations. </para>

                        <para>- I have heard of disputes as to wages, but I have never heard of a dispute as to what was the ruling rate of wage in a district in a particular industry at a given time. Of course honorable senators who are lawyers do not know this, just as we who are laymen do not know the intricacies of a lawyer's bill. All we know is that he presents his bill for £2,000, that it is sent to the taxing master, and that it is reduced to £500. </para>

                        <para>- In central Queensland the ruling or recognised rate of wages would be about £2 2s. or £2 '5s. a week. The department advertised for tenders and accepted the lowest tender. At that time employment was very scarce in the central division : the various tenderers competed with each other to such a degree that the price was low, and in this way the post - office derived an advantage from the condition of the labour market at the time. </para>

                        <para>- This would be an instruction to the Government to put it in the contract. Embodied in an Act of Parliament, the amendment would compel contractors who tendered for post-office work to base their tenders upon the knowledge that they would have to pay the ruling rate of wages in the locality. I have known a number of contractors who competed for post-office work on the assumption that they would be able to get labour at a much lower price than the ordinary rate prevailing in the locality, and would be able to take advantage of some temporary want of employment on the part of the labouring classes or of tradesmen connected with certain industries. Therefore, I think it desirable to say that every man employed directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth shall be paid such an amount as he ought to receive. If the feeling against sweating, which we hear expressed throughout Australia, is really a sincere one, coming from the heart and not from the lips merely, this amendment will be welcomed, and the Commonwealth Government will thus set a good example in regard to paying every man. in its employment, from the highest to the lowest, a fair and reasonable wage. That being the case what objection can there be to the amendment ? </para>

As this clause does not provide for fixing of fees, I do not press my amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It does not matter whether it is in committee or not. The vote given was a casting vote, and the only vote that could be given was a deliberative vote. The Chairman stated in giving the vote that there were fourteen on each side, and that he gave his casting vote. The point of order I raise is as to whether the question should not, under the circumstances, have passed in the negative. </para>

                            is like the fellow who did not want arbitration because it went against him. I have been pointing out that it is perfectly clear that no standing orders can go behind what is embodied in the Constitution, so as to. enable the Senate, simply because it happens to be sitting in committee, to have a different rule with respect to voting to that adopted when the President is in the chair. The Chairman had a deliberative vote and chose to exercise a casting vote. We must assume that he did not desire to give his deliberative vote because his own expression was that he intended to give his casting vote, and he could have given no other by the standing orders. If the Chairman has a right to give a casting vote, he could give it as he thinks fit, but it is simply a casting vote and not a deliberative vote. I say we cannot get away from that position, and it is impossible now to cure it by saying that the Chairman intended it to be a deliberative vote.

                        <para>- It is not merely a question as to whether this particular amendment shall be carried or not. There is a much greater question underlying the whole thing - the question as to what is to be the rule in the future. Now that the opportunity arises the matter should be decided once and for all, so that we may know what position we are in. This is a matter of grave importance, and we should have it decided now, even if it is necessary to get the President to give his ruling upon it, that we may know how to conduct the business of the Senate in the future. I hope honorable senators will argue the point of order apart altogether from any feeling as to whether the amendment should have been carried or not. It is a very much more important question than that, and it is one that should be determined once and for all. </para>

The standing orders say that when objection is taken to the ruling of the Chairman of Committees it must be taken at once, and stated in writing. I have also done that.

After all, what is the point? -It is whether the Chairman should have recorded his vote with the tellers or whether he should have given his vote after they had handed in their, papers. Really it does seem to me that this is the purest splitting of straws. If the Chairman had recorded one more vote than was his right then we might have something to quarrel about. But seeing that it is only a matter of whether he should have recorded his vote a few moments before he did, or whether he was right in doing it as he did, it seems to me altogether beneath our consideration. Honorable senators may say it is a question of principle. It is not a question of principle. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. The South Australian standing orders take away his vote, otherwise, if he remained in the chamber he would have to record his vote. Here he is in the chamber with the Constitution giving him a vote whether he is in the chair or whether he is not, and he has to cast it on one side or the other. Whether he should have done so a few moments before he did seems, to my mind, beneath the consideration of the committee. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to order. I submit that the objection to the Chairman's casting vote was not put until after the second one came. Other matter was discussed, sir, and honorable senators can testify that, even when you gave your ruling, the first point of order had not been put in writing. </para>

                    <para>- The parliamentary rule is that when a Chairman gives a casting vote, it is to be given so that the matter under discussion may be again discussed. I therefore contend that the Chairman gave a deliberative vote, because he gave his vote with the ayes. But whether he did that or not he gave a vote which carried the question in the affirmative. To my mind that shows that he gave a deliberative vote. Then comes the question in regard to the standing orders. I submit that those standing orders are applicable only in so far as they do not conflict with the Constitution, and that it would be inconsistent with the Constitution to put the Chairman in such a position that he would be deprived of his vote, and that consequently the State he represents would be deprived of a vote. There is no portion of the. standing orders . or of the Constitution which decides at what time that vote is to be given. I submit that although the Chairman waited until the votes were found to be equal, he was in time to give his vote, and therefore that his vote was properly given. For these reasons, I submit that there is nothing in this question of order, and that the vote of the Chairman was properly given. </para>

                    <para>- I draw attention to the last paragraph of clause 91. I thought the Postmaster-General had an amendment to move upon it, but as I see he has not, I raise the question as to how these regulations are to be made, and when they are to have the force of law. It is, I think, very important to provide-that before these regulations shall have the force of law they shall be submitted to and approved of by Parliament. I move - </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - The Postmaster-General apparently does not see the difficulty that, if this clause is passed, it will apply to a special class of public servants. The Public Service Bill, fixes the fines in the case of officers of all other departments. I take it that the public service should be treated in this matter as a whole, and no one department should be singled out for special treatment.
