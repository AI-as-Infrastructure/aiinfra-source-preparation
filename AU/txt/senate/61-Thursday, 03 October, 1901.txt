            <para>- The proper procedure would be to move the suspension of the standing orders in order that the motion might be valid. That is a different thing to giving notice. The validation of a notice of motion is not required. The validation of the motion when moved is what is required. I suggest that if the Vice-President of the Executive Council gives the notice, and then moves to suspend the standing orders, that will be the best way of attaining what he desires. </para>

            <para>- No. The word " refunded " would apply where there had been a rebate of the whole of the duty, but as I have just explained there may be a rebate of part of the duty only. For instance, there are the cases which we dealt with yesterday in which dutiable materials are allowed to be used in the manufacture of certain articles, and the Government have power to deal with the materials used in any way they think fit so far as the duty is concerned. There may be a rebate of portion or of the whole duty. There must be power to make regulations dealing with questions of this kind. Where there is a refund of the duty we do not want any regulations, but we must have power to deal with rebate cases, and that is why the words "duty paid as prescribed " are used. There may be a question as to the payment of duty, and we want power to make regulations dealing with the whole matter. </para>

          <para>. - The House of Representatives has omitted the words "first day of October, one thousand nine hundred and one." The clause refers to the date on which the Bill shall come into operation. The Bill was introduced in the first week in June. I was sanguine enough at the time to anticipate that it would become law by the 1st October, and I fixed upon that date. It has been longer in its passage through Parliament than I anticipated, and the question now is what is the most convenient date to insert in the clause. I propose to postpone the consideration of the amendment until we have dealt with others made by the House of Representatives, because they may have a bearing upon it. Before the Bill actually comes into operation, it will be desirable to have regulations provided. </para>

I do not propose to raise any objection to the acceptance of the amendment, because I was very much charmed with the way in which the House of Representatives met lis the other evening, when we insisted upon amendments in a certain Bill. I am very much in favour of maintaining the greatest harmony between the two Chambers. But I think the Postmaster-General and the Cabinet should be in a better position, generally speaking, than Parliament, to decide upon the rates which will make the Post and Telegraph department a businesslike establishment, and a paying concern. </para>

          <para>- I think there is also another vital alteration, because, as the clause left the Senate, it provided that every person appointed as a telegraph messenger after the commencement of the Act should retire from the service of the department on attaining the age of eighteen years, " unless in the meantime he has been transferred or promoted to some other position in such service." I think that expression carries on the face of it the inference that, if possible, these boys should be transferred to some other branch of the service on attaining the age stated, and certainly no harm would follow if the words to which I have referred had been retained. The clause as we agreed to it certainly seemed to provide for a more humane treatment of these boys. </para>

          <para>- This is a matter which I think deserves some consideration. There are a number of boys employed as messengers continuously in the service, which they enter at from twelve to thirteen years of age. I think it is hard and harsh to provide that these boys may be retained for four or five years and then be subject to be sent adrift when they have arrived at the age of seventeen years, which is, perhaps, the most criticial period of a person's life. That is how the matter strikes me, though it is possible that those who have to work a large concern like the Postal department may see difficulties in the way. I think it is our duty to arrange matters in such a way that these boys shall not be liable to be thrown out at the critical period of their lives when they might resort to idle habits and drift into channels of a more or less deplorable character, and when they might bring discredit upon themselves and be a source of pain and anxiety to their parents or relations. I should be sorry to agree with the proposal submitted by the House of Representatives unless strong reasons are given to show that it would be impossible to continue these boys in the department or to draft them to some other department. </para>

          <para>- We had a very long discussion on this clause, and some of us voted to strike it out, and leave it to the Postmaster-General and his officers to determine when the time had arrived for messenger boys to be dismissed. I am afraid that if we agree to this amendment, we may do a very great injustice to some of the messenger boys who may be taken on. Supposing that a boy has entered the service at about fourteen, and that he is approaching his seventeenth year. His officer can see that changes will shortly take place which will enable him to give the youth a promotion, but if the Act is strictly administered, the youth cannot possibly be continued in the service. I see right through the clause a great danger of hardships being wrought. What the supporters of the clause desire most is to prevent young men being continued in the service, and practically rendering themselves unfit for any other work. If a boy is retained until he is eighteen or nineteen, he is then totally unsuited to learn a trade. At that age a boy would be unable to enter any other employment with profit to himself, and that, I think, is the reason why the other House inserted the amendment. I hope that the clause will not be administered too stringently, that if an opportunity arises for a boy to be promoted he will not be given his walking ticket simply because he is within a month or two of seventeen. </para>

          <para>- I think that the other House has made a mistake in lowering the age. .Although the provision in the clause is not mandatory, still it is an expression of the wish of Parliament that a boy should go, unless in the meantime he has been transferred or promoted to some other position. It is a provision to which a boy can appeal. He can say to his superior officer - " If I have qualified myself for a higher position than that of a mere messenger, and there is a vacancy, it is your duty to employ me." I feel certain that on reconsideration the other House will see. that the Senate acted more liberally than it did as regards the age, and express a pious wish that the boys will have a chance afforded to them to go higher in the service. </para>

          <para>- If a boy has to go through unfitness the sooner he goes the better. If he has to face the world it is better that he should start at seventeen than at eighteen. The longer a boy retains the position of messenger, the more is he made into a sort of civil servant, and, as we know, civil servants are not very well adapted to battle with the world. If a boy is fit and eligible he will be drafted into other branches of the service. If a boy ceases to be a messenger when he is twenty it is all the more difficult for him to adapt himself to his new surroundings. There is no indication that a boy will be drafted to another position, and if an amendment to that effect were inserted the clause would be perfect. </para>

            <para>- The age is seventeen in Victoria, and I think that is the reason why it is now proposed. I can state from my own knowledge that it has worked well in the past in Victoria.

          <para>- I think it would be better to keep to eighteen as the age at which boys should cease to be employed as messengers. It is most desirable that the messengers themselves should be given to understand that facilities are afforded to them for Securing permanent employment in the service, in some clerical or other position. As to the age at which these boys should enter the service, it is all very well to have a limit of thirteen years of age, but I would point out that as a rule a boy at the age of thirteen is not qualified to pass a public service examination. "We wish these boys to pass an examination for permanent positions at ft later date, and if they are taken away from school at the age of thirteen it is only one lad in a score - perhaps only one out of a hundred - who will take the trouble to work and qualify himself to pass an examination. I therefore think the age of thirteen is too young at which to take a boy into the public service if he is to obtain a position somewhat better than that of a messenger. Judging from the small infants we see about Melbourne wearing uniforms, the boys who are employed by the Post-office in this State are very juvenile indeed. </para>

            <para>- They may be good, but they are certainly small. It would be very much better in my opinion that these boys should be of a more mature age when taken into the service, and that they should be allowed to remain until the age of eighteen. If they were allowed to stop at school until they were fourteen, they would be more likely to qualify themselves afterwards for better positions. I therefore trust that the age will be increased to eighteen. </para>

            <para>- I think we are giving almost too much time to the consideration of this amendment, because the question of whether a boy should be sent out at seventeen or eighteen is not a very important one. One boy at fifteen may be, in knowledge and manner, as old as another boy of seventeen or eighteen. It is purely empirical, but some age must be fixed upon. It is hardly possible for any one to say dogmatically whether seventeen or eighteen is the right age at which a boy should leave the service. With regard to the proposed insertion of the words " unless in the meantime he has been transferred or promoted," I do not think they would serve any useful purpose. That is covered by the word "so." But if the committee wishes to test the matter by moving the omission of the word " so," and the addition of these other words, I shall offer no objection. </para>

        <para>Unless in the meantime he has been transferred or promoted to some position in such service- in the clause, as sent down by us, were not only absolutely meaningless and unnecessary, but quite inconsistent with the earlier part of the clause, because they made imperative retirement from the service at eighteen years of age, unless in the meantime the youth had been transferred. That, on the face of it, is an absurdity. Then I think the word " so " should not be struck oat, because it is merely from the particular employment referred to that the boy is to retire. I would leave the clause as it is, except as to the age, which I think should be eighteen, and at the end I would add certain words. The words " cease to be so employed " get rid of the particular employment, but in order to encourage the lads, and let them feel that under this hard-and-fast rule we do not absolutely shut them out from the service, I would add - </para>

I was sorry at the time that the Senate did not see eye to eye with me on the subject ; and it is pleasing to find that in another place they have done exactly what I wanted the Senate to do, and in a way which is satisfactory to me, and which will prevent the Postmaster-General from being able to use private wharfs or State wharfs for passing over hundreds of tons of material to be used in the construction of a line of telegraphs without paying a penny to the owner of the wharf. I see that under the amendment, where there is a difficulty in coming to an agreement as to the amount, it is to be met in the fairest possible way by arbitration. ' </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that it does apply to that, because the word "arrangement" is used. We have one clause which provides for the Governor-General making an arrangement, and another clause which provides for the. Postmaster-General making contracts. It does not apply in the case of putting a mail on a steamer, and I apprehend that we could put mails on the P. and O. boats in the same way as we do on other boats. The German or French boats carry our mails without any contract or arrangement. They carry them simply by force of law. The amendment of the other House would clearly prevent us from entering into any contract or making any arrangement with those companies for the conveyance of mails. Under all the circumstances, I think the wiser course which can be adopted by the Senate is to accept the amendment. I move - </para>

          <para>-I congratulate the Postmaster-General upon finding it necessary to offer these wide apologies for this provision, and to do his best to explain away its operation. He has told us that it will not apply here and that it will not apply there, and he even has had doubts as to whether it would apply to the contracts with the great foreign going mail steamers. There can be no doubt that the clause has been drafted to apply not only to the contracts with the ocean going steamers, but to stop the conveyance of a letter on any vessel on which a coloured person is employed. At this time, especially when we are about to pass very drastic measures to conserve what we call a white Australia, we should be very careful indeed that we do not take any course calculated to bring ridicule and disgrace upon Australia. </para>

            <para>- Let me put this point to my honorable friends. I suppose - although 1 hope it will never happen in my time - that a great naval war is bound to take place some time. In that event, the 36,000 lascars employed in our ships may be the very saving of the British Empire ; because 10,000 or 15,000 of our own seamen may be drowned or killed, and then the men of the mercantile marine will have to come forward. We may then be glad of the services of these sober, worthy, and industrious lascars. The paper I hold in my hand shows that the Royal navy will, in the near future, inevitably have to get additional men, and that the men they are now able to obtain are not sufficient for the requirements of the service. In this paper, which deals with Iascar crews, I find the following passage : - </para>

          <para>I have also pointed out that the bulk of our foreign seamen are down from the Scandinavian countries, and it is not within the bounds of possibility that we shall ever be at war with those countries. Again, large numbers of lascars are employed. They are our Indian subjects, and therefore our fellow subjects, but as we are not likely to be at war with them, their employment in the merchant lines tends again to release a number of British seamen for service in the navy. </para>

          <para>It was obviously impossible to rel3' upon the merchant marine as a reserve for the navy in anything like the same proportion as in days gone by, but 30 years ago  the figures were 197,000 and 48,000 respectively. If all the merchant seamen were British, they would not constitute a source of supply to meet the wastage of a great naval war in anything like the proportion of past times. He could not agree that the employment of foreign seamen in the merchant marine necessarily constituted a source of danger in time of war, because the seamen were drawn from so many nationalities. Even during the pressure of the great French war in 1803, the navigation laws were partially suspended to allow three fourths of the crews of British ships to be foreigners. </para>

He did not see why men whose frugal habits and hardy pursuits adapted, them for such service should not be employed on terms which they themselves were willing to accept.

            <para>- It is out of consideration for the white man, and because of the appalling strain attaching to this work, that lascars are employed in the stoke-holes of these vessels. I asked the manager of the Orient Company the meaning of their change of front. He said it was absolutely forced upon them. "If you would go down to the wharf," he remarked, " and see the Orient steamers waiting there to get off, and see the white stokers dragged down to the ships by the police, looking more dead than alive - if you could see the looks of the wretched beings - you would recognise that we are driven to employ lascars." I ask Ministers in the Senate, whether they are going to vote against their conscience in, this matter ; whether they are going to commit an act which, I think, would be most unwise and unstatesmanlike, simply because one of their colleagues in another place has changed his mind. I know that this is a delicate subject ; that it gives rise to a constitutional question ; but it has been said, that the Senate is going to stand up for its rights, and I think we have a right to insist upon our first proposal. Ministers here should stand up for the opinions and convictions honestly expressed by the Senate. This is not a party question, and I do not think that </para>

            <para>- I cannot say everything at once. I do not possess that faculty which the honorable :aud learned senator enjoys ; but I intend to explain fully my position in this matter. I was observing that one of the cardinal points of our policy in dealing with the Commonwealth is that Australia shall be maintained as a place for the white races. Although it is not a necessary part of that policy that we should see that the principle is observed in all contracts dealing with the carrying of mails from and to Australia, the same principle is involved. That principle is, that if we find it necessary for the maintenance of a white Australia to do an act which may seem inhospitable to other parts of the Empire, we are under that first and greatest law of nature, self-preservation, and we have to look after ourselves first of all. Therefore all these arguments we have heard as to the injustice to the other inhabitants of the Empire, in India and other places, seem to me to be answered in one word. If to do this is to do an injustice to them, then the answer is that it is necessary for our preservation that this injustice should be done. Has this question of a white Australia any bearing upon this matter at all ? I say it has - in this sense, that the Commonwealth wishes to carry out the policy of a white Australia and will spend, and does spend now, a very large amount in the carriage of mails. </para>

I believe that had they acted fairly in the other Chamber, possibly the difficulty that now faces us would not have appeared. I am confident that, had the Government been firm in the House of Representatives, the division at any rate would have been very close, even if the Government had not won by a small majority. </para>

            <para>- The paltry few thousands of pounds we pay in this respect is only a tithe - a drop in the bucket - compared with what we pay for black labour in other directions. We pay for black labour in connexion with almost everything we eat and drink and wear. Is it because British shipping is carrying a few letters for us that we are to demand the right to interfere ? We only contribute a very small part of the subsidy received by these boats. The amendment is aimed at certain shipping companies only. </para>

I am not going to argue whether the work done in the stoke-hole of the steamers can be done by white labour, though my own opinion is that it is not white men's work. I am for elevating the white race, not degrading it. I am for keeping the white race to employment that will elevate the mind and help the body as well, and am not in favour of putting the white race to labour that will degrade them and make them as bad as brute beasts.

        <para>SenatorFRASER.- If the British money lender closed his pockets to us for three months we should be practically insolvent. The Senate ought to hold firm to the vote which it gave on a previous occasion. I trust that there will be no backsliding, and that we shall say we are not going to insert a miserable amendment such as this in a Postal Bill. It deals with matters that have no part in such a measure. When we are considering the question of a white Australia let us deal with it thoroughly ; but it is absurd to talk of inserting such a provision as this by a mere side wind. I hope that the amendment will be rejected. For Ministers to say that matters will go on as they are for four years is a paltry way of dealing with the question. If the principle is a wicked one let us fight it now. </para>

            <para>- For that work they are. I have seen stoker after stoker on one of the Orient boats hauled up on deck, and stretched out in a fainting state more dead than alive. There was a regular commotion on the steamer for some days, and the doctor and his assistants had work enough to bring them round with ice and cold water. That went on for some days, because the steamer was going through the Red Sea at half-speed, since they could not possibly keep up steam to enable her to go through in the ordinary time. I have been a passenger through the Red Sea also upon one of the P. and O . steamers at the same time of the year, and everything went on as smoothly and as quietly as during any other part of the voyage. That to my mind proves beyond a doubt that the lascar stoker is superior to the white stoker for work in the tropics, at all events during a certain part of the year. </para>

            <para>- What are we going to gain if this amendment is accepted ? Do honorable senators think for a moment that the P. and 0. Company will discharge all their lascars and disorganize their business to comply with this provision? They have nine of their best steamers trading to Australia, and is it likely they will discharge the crews of these steamers to satisfy a few persons of a certain class in Australia ? There is not the least fear that they will do that for the sake of the subsidy they receive from Australia. I understand that the P. and O. and Orient companies receive something like £70,000 a year between them in mail subsidies or about £35,000 for each company. The Messageries Company have four steamers trading to Australia, and each of their boats is subsidized to the extent of £10,000 for each voyage it makes. That is the subsidy which the French Government gives to this company for the purpose of securing as much of the trade of Australia as they can secure. I believe that the German line of steamers is subsidized as highly by the German Government. The whole object of these subsidies is to secure the Australian trade, and we are trying to pass laws now which will only hamper our own British companies, and throw the trade of Australia into the hands of foreign companies. </para>

            <para>- Not at all. I am with the honorable senator heart and soul in the substance, but not in the abuse to which he puts the substance. I always thought that white Australia was a bit of a cry. I accepted it as I accept everything where the feeling is so strong that either you have to accept it or to wipe yourself out. Rut the white Australia being accepted, I object to this abuse of it. What does it all come to? We are going to dictate to the world. We do not know exactly how the finances will come out. AH the States are exceedingly anxious as to how -the balance-sheet will come out, and we are superadding to that at the earliest opportunity, when all ought to be peace, and we ought to interfere as little as possible with existing conditions, every precious fad which any one can think of. It may be all right ultimately ; but do not hurry the thing too much. Find out exactly how you are, and incidentally find out your relations with other people, and do not presume to dictate that you will not consent to something unless others agree to it, when they have to pay the greater part of the money. That is common sense, not sentiment. This is only a cry got up to catch popularity. There is no substance in this talk about these men being employed. Nearly all the speakers have never seen the degraded conditions which necessarily come from working in the steamers in a climate so terrible as that in the Red Sea. </para>

We have to take things as we find them. Although we are the greatest people in the world - greater than the country we came from- and are entitled- to have the whole world to ourselves, still we must incidentally agree that in the common cause- of Christianity, which we talk about sometimes, and do .not practise much, there might be a little consideration given to these poor people, whose lands we claim the right to take, whose liberties we claim the right to control, and whom we refuse to assist in any shape. As far as my experience goes - I admit that it is not as great as that which some honorable senators have had - I do not wish to see my friends opposite, or their friends, who will also be mine, engaged in a line of labour which I think would be horrible and demoralizing to them. It may be a painful tiling that we have to employ any one to do this work, but. after all the men who do it are born in a tropical climate, and can endure what we cannot endure. I entirely dispute the proposition that Europeans can endure the climate of the Red Sea as these lascars can. It is said that the Orient Company have never employed black labour. But they want to do it. Why? Because they cannot make their business pay otherwise. </para>

            <para>- It must have a disturbing influence in connexion with the line of policy we are going to adopt ; and all for a sentimental cry about a white Australia. There is no fear of Australia not being white - not the slightest fear. When  the British came here the population was black Through the ennobling influences of the civilized whites, the blacks are nearly all dead. Through the equally ennobling influence of the whites, other blacks will be dead; and that will be the inevitable conclusion of this comedy - or comedy and tragedy - which is going on amongst us. </para>

I think it is just as well that in certain tropical parts of the world people who are acclimatized to tropical conditions should do the work. I believe they are the only people who can do it, and that if white people try to do it, it will lead, not to the improvement of the race which we long for, not to that rising to higher things to which we want the white race to attain, hut to demoralization, and to dragging the white race down to a lower standard. </para>

            <para>- I rise to a point of order. My honorable friend has, quite unintentionally, misrepresented me, and I think he will find that his language is exceedingly strong. All I did was to quote what has been told me again and again, namely, that British sailors in these stokeholes have a facility for getting tipsy and for deserting, and that some of the steam-ship companies have been driven to employ Iascar crews. </para>

            <para>-I regret that this matter has to be discussed in the Senate again. When it was previously discussed I regretted that we were not successful in embodying this proposal in the Post and Telegraph Bill. Other honorable senators and myself did the best we could, but we were beaten by a considerable majority. The other House, I am pleased to say, viewed the matter in a different light, and came to the conclusion that we in the Senate were not justified in the course we pursued. Now, instead of standing in the proud position in which the Senate was entitled to stand with regard to this great question, we have the matter before us again from the other Chamber, and we are whipped into line by the House of Representatives and asked to pass this proposal. </para>

            <para>- It is no more than a payment for services rendered. We agree to pay them a higher price than we should be called upon to pay if we did not stipulate that the mails must be landed within a certain time. We pay more because we are desirous of having our mails landed quickly. I can assure honorable senators as a marine engineer, that it costs the companies every penny of the extra amount we pay them to bring the mails here within the stipulated time. Honorable senators may not know that when boats are run at a high speed the cost is as the cube of the speed ; and therefore the cost to these companies in carrying the mails at the speed at which they carry them runs into an enormous amount. I therefore think that the companies are under no obligation to us. If we pay them more than is necessary, supposing they were allowed to deliver the mails as it suited their convenience - if instead of letting them drive their boats at twelve knots an hour we compel them to drive at sixteen - we have to pay them extra for doing so ; but I dare say it would be more profitable to the companies not to drive their boats at sixteen knots, and not to receive the little extra amount we pay them, but to run them at a slower speed and be paid less. Therefore whether we call the payment a subsidy or not, it is, I repeat, simply payment for services rendered; and we take good care we get full value for the money we pay them. If  we employ a Japanese or any other boat, no matter what flag she may fly, and put our mails on board, and that boat has a coloured crew, we shall be paying that ship for services rendered just as we now pay to the P. and O. Company when we enter into a five years' contract with it. We say to a ship : " Take our mails to Yokohama and we will pay you so much." Similarly we say to the P. and O . Company - " We will pay you so much for carrying our mails for five years." Therefore I am puzzled to know how the Government are going to give full effect to the amendment they have accepted in another place. </para>

          <para>- I approach this question from a somewhat different stand-point to many honorable senators who have preceded me. I have heard very eloquent orations on the humanitarian side of the question, the national side, the side of the unemployed, and the side of the steam-ship companies, from almost every side except that which appeals to my sense of responsibility in the matter, the practical side, of how this proposal will affect the Commonwealth as a whole. .That is the point upon which I propose to address myself, and before sitting down I shall ask leave to move an amendment, inserting certain words in the clause as passed in another place. I have heard also a number of statements that I venture to think were made in good faith, but which, in some instances, nevertheless, were rather random in their character. For instance, I have heard it said by one honorable senator that the total number of British seamen has fallen by something like 100,000 during the last 25 years. From the Parliamentary Library I have obtained the Statesman's Year Book. I suppose it is a very heterodox, volume to Some people, but I believe its-, figures may be accepted. Without going over a period of more than ten years, instead of a reduction in the number of seamen employed in vessels doing the carrying trade of Great Britain, and registered in Great Britain, excluding river boats, I find that there has been an increase. The figures run from 1889 to 1898 inclusive, a period of ten years. The number of men employed in 1889 was 230,000. </para>

            <para>- Will the. honorable senator allow me to finish my quotation1! It is hardly worth troubling, about the hundreds, the tens, and units. I will take the thousands, saying merely that if I took the hundreds, tens, and units, they would be in favour of my proposition, that there has been an increase rather than, a decrease in the number of British sailors.. 230,000 was the number of men employed, in 1889, 242,000 was the number employed in 1898. That is an increase of 12,000.. It may seem a very small one. </para>

            <para>.- Unfortunately these figures as to coloured sailors are of little value to me or to the committee, because we have not the corresponding figures for the first year I have quoted. Therefore I am not in a position to state whether there has been an increase or a decrease. Certainly, in the total number of men employed on British ships, there has not been an actual decrease, such as we have been led to believe, in the number of British sailors. There has been a great deal said, and very strongly and well said, with reference to the maintenance of the true type of the British seaman. Let me say, with the greatest respect, that I think honorable senators who use that argument wholly overlook the fact that the amendment before us now will in no shape or form, seek to preserve the purity of British seamen. The British marine is to be open to the scum of European prisons. I am not going to relate instances about hosing blackfellows in the Bed Sea, but I am aware, of my own knowledge, that in connexion with one of the largest vessels that visits Australia, owing to the fact that she was compelled, by reason of another boat going ashore, to be driven at a higher rate of speed than usual the slums of Naples were ransacked one Sunday evening for more firemen the moment a telegram from the agent reached the vessel there. About the hardest-faced lot of savages of any colour that one could find in all the globe were taken on board that steamer to bring her on to Australia at a higher rate of speed than the number of firemen she had on board would have permitted. I venture to think that under this clause we shall open our ports, without let or hindrance, to the scum of Europe. We need not set up the argument that the clause is for the protection of the noble British seaman. That is twaddle. A clean living blackfellow is as good as a dirty living white man. </para>

            <para>.-I have respect for the Hindoo, who, under the old flag of England, saved not only English, but other European life in the . legations of Pekin. I have more respect and admiration for those men than for the class that under this amendment can come into the Commonwealth ; the class which produced the assassins of the crowned and elective heads of the people of Europe and America. That is why, in my humble opinion - which I am entitled to hold, and I hope I do not offend any one's susceptibilities because I express it - we should not accept the amendment as it stands. We have other questions to regard in this matter. We have contracts running that will last for the next four years, and this clause, if passed as proposed by the other House, will be whole inoperative for four years as regards the great mail carrying of the Commonwealth. We have but a one third interest in these con tracts. The British Government is after all the contracting party ; we have a potential voice if we have not a controlling voice in these contracts, but we shall have to go to the British Government to arrange for the carriage of our mails under this clause. I venture humbly, but very confidently, to prognosticate that before the end of four years, when the time comes for negotiation, my honorable and learned friend the Postmaster-General or his successor will come to this Chamber and his colleagues to the other Chamber, and ask for the repeal of a provision which will be found inoperative because of its impossible character. </para>

But when two people meet and start to discuss a question on which their views are diametrically opposed, it is hardly worth while spending time beating the air to convince those who cannot be convinced. Let me say that if we did not take coloured soldiers to Africa at least we accepted their money to no small value, and we accepted trained war steeds from the hands of the native rulers of India. We know also that in that great time of stress - in 1885, was it not ? - Indian coloured troops were taken over to fight, if need be, even the battles of Europe itself. </para>

            <para>- We are told that we should object to the employment of coloured men in the mercantile marine of England, but I want honorable senators to let their thoughts rove back again, and when they Speak, as some have done, in glowing terms of the efforts of the seamen of England in days gone past, I would like to know if there was a ship's crew amongst them that had not two or three African blacks in their number? It was notorious that African blacks were to be found in almost every ship that sailed under the glorious pennant of Nelson. If we are to be told that the British Parliament will scotch a few unfortunate blacks from the stoke-holes of the maritime force of England, how is it that the head of the Empire thinks them good enough to go thousands of miles - .a longer journey than any King of England ever took before - to go to India to be. crowned amongst his coloured subjects. Is that any sign that these natives are to be cleared out of the stoke-holes of a few steamers ? The British Empire is something too large to devote its energies to such miserable marble playing. </para>

            <para>.- There are some other questions- connected with this upon which I should like to say a word, though I do not intend to speak at length. There is a great deal in the present agitation that reminds me of an event that took place a little while before I came into the world, and which was still very strong in the memory of people living in England when I was a child there. I refer to what were known as the machinery riots. It was all a question of cost as this is all a question of cost. Pay these niggers as high a price as white men, and we are told there will he no objection to them. In the case of the machinery riots in England, the great object was to get rid of machinery that was supposed to be interfering with the living of those concerned in occupations into which machinery was introduced. It was only a few years ago that steam tramways were introduced into Sydney. There was, at the time, a perfect howl about it, and petitions were actually presented to Parliament in opposition to the steam tramways in the interests of people engaged in the breeding of horses. They thought all the buses would be run off, and, burlesque as it seems, petitions were actually presented by occupants of the soil in opposition to the steam trams, because of the evil effects it was thought they would have upon the industry of horse breeding. </para>

            <para>- I do not think I have any recollection of reading any historical incident of a horse speaking, but I do recollect keenly reading of a somewhat similar beast making observations to his master. We have heard the American navy cited as an admirable instance of the ability of the Anglo-Saxon sailor. When there was an American man-of-war here I spent a very happy half-day on board of her. But I saw quite as many Chinamen on board that ship as American sailors, and when I asked how it was that they managed, in view of the laws existing in America, to employ Chinese on board an American warship, the answer was that they employed them on all ships on foreign stations. When I asked what they did with them, the answer was that they sacked them at the last port before going home. I may not mention names, because that would be indecent as I was a guest, but there was no secrecy about it ; it was an absolute regulation, and one of the most competent persons in the American Navy is my authority for the statement I have made. We need not make any fuss that the British Navy is going to the dogs and that the American navy is going to climb to the sky because they do not employ coloured labour. They employ whiskies, and that answers as well to the darky from Hindustan. I have been dealing with the national aspect of the question and I desire also to deal with the business aspect of it. I find that this proposal says nothing about a subsidy or payment, but absolutely prohibits the making of a contract or arrangement for the carriage of mails if there is any " coloured brother " about. Everybody knows that the word " contract " covers any agreement that can be entered into, and not necessarily only a written one or a time bargain. Written contracts are required under the Statute of 'Frauds in connexion with real property, but there is no obligation that a contract about any other matter should be in writing, and the term "contract" will cover any agreement that may be made either for a term of years or for the carriage of a single bag. I find also that the word "arrangement" is used. There is no interpretation clause to say what is meant by the word "arrangement, " but it must necessarily involve any form of agreement for the carriage of mail matter, either for a term or for a single- voyage. It must be so. I do not want to see the Commonwealth put in such a position that it cannot have letters delivered to any part of the world to which it is desirable to deliver them. There runs to Australia to-day a very well-equipped and, so far as I know, a handsomely-appointed line of steamers belonging to the Japanese Imperial  Government. </para>

            <para>- I have very little more to say. As regards Imperial mail contracts this clause will not be found operative. It will be found simply a difficulty, and will have to be revoked before we can enter into any contracts, and it is for that reason that I do not take so strong a view on the subject as many honorable senators do. If my amendment is inserted there will be no harm done if we pass the clause, because it will be simply inoperative. If my amendment is adopted, I take it that we shall be free to have our letters- carried where necessary on a single voyage by simply saying to a captain - " We want you to cany these letters, and we shall pay you a small sum for the service," and there the whole transaction will end. I am certainly not in favour of encouraging any form of arrangement that will needlessly bring about the employment of coloured men to the exclusion of our own people. </para>

            <para>- Decidedly not. The Postmaster-General can put a mail on board any mail steamer which is leaving a port if he pays the prescribed rate, and it is no more a contract than when a man* sends a parcel by parcel delivery. That is not what it is intended to effect at all. It refers to contracts and arrangements. If honorable senators will turn to clause 14 they will find that for the transmission of mails - </para>

            <para>- I am of opinion that under that clause if we put our mail bags on their steamers and pay the prescribed rate, they will be bound to carry them, as I said at an early period of the evening. Again, if we are satisfied to send out our mails to Japan or New Caledonia just as ordinary freight matter is sent, we can do so by putting them on board and paying the prescribed rate. </para>

            <para>- It does not let us out of it, as I mentioned early in the afternoon. It leaves us the power of putting our bags on a steamer which is leaving the port. But what we cannot do if this amendment is accepted, is to enter into a contract with any steam-ship company to carry our mails at certain stated periods for an agreed upon sum. </para>

            <para>- That refers to clause 14, which gives the Governor-General power to make arrangements with the British Postmaster-General or the constituted authorities in foreign countries to have our mail matter carried over their routes. In those cases the British Postmaster-General or the proper authorities in foreign countries make the contract, and we make an arrangement by which we participate in the benefits and burdens of the contract. </para>
