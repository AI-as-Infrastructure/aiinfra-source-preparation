            <para>- I feel perfectly certain that they are not concentrated into one section. Whether we get them filtered down through a number of sections, I cannot say. But it is perfectly apparent that the effect of 'this new clause, taken in conjunction with clause 179, would be to enable any Customs officer to open all - the goods, or any goods and packages on any oversea ship, whether the cargo was : unbroken or not or whether she intended to land an atom of her cargo at. a particular port of call or not, or whether she was a British ship or a foreign ship, or any other ship. That is in entire conflict with the principles of the Customs Bill. What do we levy duties upon ? We levy them upon goods imported into the Commonwealth and put into consumption. We do not intend to levy duty on the cargo of a ship that simply calls at a port and takes her cargo away again, and what right have we to place a ship under the control of the Customs officers with a view to enabling them under clause 179 to break open her packages, and to explore her cargo, when no portion of it is intended to be landed on our shores? This is a very serious provision indeed. I doubt very much whether it is lawful. Whether it is lawful or unlawful we need not inquire into, but certainly it applies to goods that by no possibility and according to no principle under which duties of Customs are levied can we exercise or have any control over. Clause 30 covers the whole ground so far as duties of Customs are concerned. First "all goods imported " are subject to the control of the Customs, that is, they may remain in bond or may be delivered out at once after entries are passed and the duties paid. Then" all goods under drawback," and "all goods subject to any export duty " are under the control of the Customs. But the object of this new clause is to place under the control of the Customs the cargo on an oversea ship coming from Europe, not one ounce of which may be intended for importation into the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- No ; because if it were left in that way it might be argued - though I do not think successfully - that the clause applied only to goods that were under the control of the Customs, and "a limitation of that sort would be most detrimental to the power which ought to exist of verifying any statements made with regard to the contents of a ship. Suppose there were certain goods to be landed at Perth, and that it turned out that some other goods on board were intended to be smuggled into Perth. If the master had power to say - " These are the only goods that are intended to be landed at Perth, and you have no right to examine any other goods, or to test my statement with regard to any 'part of the goods, except those going out at Perth," then, although there might be goods intended to be smuggled, there would be no power of inspection by the Customs over other goods than those stated to be intended to be landed at Perth. </para>

            <para>-Hie object of the clause is to see that the revenue is properly collected, and that there is no evasion. Something has been said about ships' stores. There is no doubt that the amendment which I am now proposing would touch that question. That is not in any way the most important view of it, though it is a view which of course has to be considered. If we are to make the power to deal with ships' stores effective, it is quite clear that there must be some power of control over them. The power must be worded in much the same way as the power with regard to Customs control of the goods given in clause 30. -The whole object and scope of the clauses giving power to search will be absolutely nullified if there is only power in regard to goods which are stated to be goods to be imported into a particular place. </para>

            <para>- I am quite aware of that clause ; but the honorable and learned senator knows that it is one of the first rules of the interpretation of statutes that where you have a general power given, and it is too large for the purposes indicated by other sections, it is to be read as being controlled by the other sec- j tions. There is a strong probability, at all events, that the position will be taken up that this power exists only for the control of goods which are to be imported, as the words are used in clause 30, where there is apparently a limitation as to what "im- ' ported " means. It may then be held that . this power can only be enforced within that limitation. I cannot understand why there should be a,ny difficulty in accepting this ' clause. If honorable senators are agreed i that this is a power we should have, there should be no objection to making, it plain on the face of the Bill, and that is all we ask to have done. We ask it particularly, because almost immediately when we begin to put this power into force, which the committee has decided by a large majority we shall have in dealing with ships' stores, we may be well certain that every point that legal ingenuity can devise will be raised to defeat it. If that is so, why should we run any risk now by not making it perfectly plain what we intend, and that is that from the time a ship enters port until she leaves, she shall be subject to Customs control, and to have an officer on board with power to search, inspect, seal up, and do all those tilings which are essential to a real Customs control - the power to verify every statement made in regard to the destination of every package of goods on board the ship. </para>

            <para>- The honorable and learned senator must have misunderstood me. What I said was that this clause would have an application to ships' stores as well as to goods in general, although the application of it to ships' stores is not the most important part of its application. I pointed out just now that one of the reasons for making this perfectly clear is that the power in regard to ships' stores is likely to be early questioned, and questioned with a. great deal of ingenuity. </para>

            <para>- I think so. We are all anxious to make this Bill as perfect as we can. Whatever fiscal view a man may hold, so long as duties are imposed it is everyone's desire that they shall be collected from all goods from which they can be legitimately collected. The goods of a ship when she is in territorial waters are absolutely under the control of the officers of the Customs, but they are not in the technical meaning subject to the control of the Customs with all the attendant consequences given by the text of the Bill. </para>

          <para>- It is much to be regretted that it was not possible to circulate these amendments earlier. It is only since we came into the Senate that we have had an opportunity of seeing them. They are very wide in their scope, and are of sufficient importance to deserve a considerable amount of attention at our hands. Under the Bill at present the Customs authorities have full power to deal with all goods on board ship, and intended to be landed, either dutiable or free, as the case may be. The Customs have power over them while they are on board, while they are being landed, and until they are absolutely delivered, and also if the goods are left in bond they have control over them until they are re-exported, if that course be adopted. Thus, so far as goods for home consumption or for re-exportation are concerned, there is ample power. But the Bill goes further than that, because under clause 178 there is power for a Customs officer to search any vessel within one league of the coast. </para>

            <para>- Clause 1 78 goes to that extent. It provides that unless the vessel departs after being warned, the Customs officer may bring her into port ; and clause 180 provides for the boarding of vessels and so on, clearly showing that the intention is to give the Customs authorities power over all vessels within territorial waters. Now, we come to another question as to what that means. In view of the discussion which took place in the committee the other night upon the debatable question of ships' stores, I think it will be seen that we are pretty unanimous in the opinion that goods consumed on board ships within territorial waters should pay duty, so as to place all vessels, whether they be local or oversea ships, on exactly the same footing in that respect. I must confess that at the time I did not think the Bill fully conveyed that power, and I presume these clauses are intended to deal mainly with the consumption of ships' stores in territorial waters. If that be the object of these amendments, and they are not already embodied in the Bill, then I do not think we can very well oppose them but if, by any stretch of imagination the amendments can be read as giving power to Customs officers to act outside territorial waters, they go too far. I should imagine that these new proposals are really intended in some way to get at shipmasters who break seals outside' territorial waters. </para>

            <para>- I would say in passing that, in my humble opinion, it cannot be an illegal act to break seals outside the Commonwealth. To attempt to punish a man who comes into port, for doing that which is perfectly legal, seems to me to be a monstrous thing. But, so far as the consumption of goods within the Commonwealth is concerned, I think the Customs must have 'absolute power. I am told that the power of sealing all goods on a ship is possessed by the Customs under the existing Act - not merely the goods which are to be landed for home consumption, but all or any goods on board. </para>

Supposing, that a vessel bound from New York to Dunedin puts, into Port Phillip through stress of weather. This new clause would give the Government the necessary power to prevent any goods from being landed from that ship on our shores. Without this power in the Act vessel putting into our port in that way would be practically able to do what she liked.. </para>

            <para>- Under section 165 of the Victorian Act No. 1081, every master of a ship that comes into port must within 24 hours give a report of the whole of the cargo of that ship in accordance with Schedule 6 of the Act. There is a penalty if he does not do so. Schedule 6 states, in column 6, that the master must report as to " particulars of packages and goods, if any, for any other port in Victoria." Instead of saying " every port in Victoria," we now read " every port in the Commonwealth." The seventh column of the 6th schedule relates to " goods, if any, to be transhipped or to remain on board for exportation." That is evidently referred to in this proposal. If the master of a ship coming to a port in Victoria fails to make that report under columns 6 and 7, the Customs may detain the whole of the goods that have not been entered, and may 'give them up on such terms as the Commissioner thinks fit ; or, failing that, can convey them to the warehouse. If a ship comes in having on board goods, we will say, for Sydney, and if the captain fails to report those goods as being for Sydney, the Customs can seize them, land them, put them in a warehouse, and only give them up on such terms as the Commissioner thinks fit. </para>

            <para>- The clauses submitted by the honorable senator contain the elements of very useful legislation, but it seems to me they have no place in a Bill of this kind. The honorable senator submits five clauses which seem to provide a system for analyzing tea, to decide whether it has been adulterated or is unfit for food. That is obviously the proper office of an Adulteration Bill. The difficulty is that if we once begin to apply these principles to tea, there is no reason why they should not be applied also in. respect to a great many other articles imported through the Customs. Spirits, beer, wine, and all articles of food might be made on equally good grounds the subject of similar clauses. In the list of prohibited imports we have already included exhausted tea, tea adulterated with spurious leaf, or with exhausted leaves, or being unfit for human use, or unwholesome. </para>

            <para>- The provision being in the Bill it will be a part of the duty of the officers of the Customs to carry it out, and it cannot possibly be carried out without the assistance of experts to examine the tea and pronounce judgment upon it accordingly. I understand that it is the practice of all Custom-houses to have experts to deal with these matters. We have dealt in quite sufficient detail with this matter under clause 49, and these proposals for special legislation with regard to the examination of tea are unnecessary. The Bill, as it stands, seems to me to carry out all tho purposes which a Customs Bill can fairly have in view, and I do not think we ought to go beyond it. </para>

            <para>- Redundancy, if it is necessary, is not objectionable, and in some cases may be almost desirable, but certainly provisions do not commend themselves to my mind simply because they are voluminous and redundant. The Bill as it stands, simply providing for the prohibition of exhausted tea; is sufficient. It may be left to the Customs officers to decide what is exhausted tea. It is not as though this were a matter in which the particular quality of the tea was concerned. Exhausted tea is well known to commerce. It does not mean old leaves, but an article consisting of leaves which have been used. The practice, principally An China, I believe, is to take leaves which have been used once, and from which all the virtue has been extracted, and cook them into a compound which looks like tea, but which is really spurious. We do not desire in this Bill to lay down the particular quality of tea that may be introduced, but simply to prohibit the importation of an article which practically is not tea at all. The matter stands on the same footing as oleomargarine, which we discussed the other night. The feeling of the Senate in regard to oleomargarine was that it should be excluded, not because it might be unwholesome, but because it was in itself a fraud, prepared in such a way as to enable it to be passed off on the public for another article. The object of providing for exhausted tea in this Bill is to exclude an article which cannot be imported for any other purpose than to be sold as the genuine article. </para>

          <para>- I must admit that I cannot understand the attitude that the Government have taken up with reference to this proposed amendment. If it were a question of whether tea of an injurious character should be prohibited from Australia or not, I could understand their position, but that question has already been settled. Clause 49 provides that tea of a deleterious or exhausted nature shall not come into the Commonwealth, and these clauses lay down the process that must be gone through in order to ascertain whether tea proposed to be imported is of the proper kind. Therefore I cannot see any reason whatever why these clauses should not be inserted. The Government have raised no objections, except that the Postmaster-General is opposed to the lengthiness of the amendment, and considers that if we legislate in 'this way in regard to tea, we should insert similar clauses in regard to other goods. Those points, however, do not affect the question in the slightest degree. We must bear in mind that this matter is a very important one to Australia. We are not only the largest tea drinkers in the world, but I have also seen it stated that absolutely the worst tea in the world is imported into Australia. </para>

            <para>- I understand that that is the case. This is a question that vitally affects Australia, and, even although we may have to insert two or three additional clauses, I think it is absolutely necessary that we should insist on all tea being absolutely tested before being admitted to the Commonwealth. The Government admit that these provisions will have to be inserted in regulations if they are not introduced in the Bill. I have before expressed my opposition to leaving too much to regulations, and I think that by these clauses we should provide in the Bill the means by which all tea can be tested. Then we shall have an assurance that nothing but healthy tea will be imported into Australia. There is probably no commodity imported which 'is so likely to be adulterated with deleterious compounds as tea, and as the Government has admitted that similar provisions would have to be inserted in the regulations, I intend to support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- As a matter of practice I think that when an honorable senator moves a new clause he should take the responsibility of making a selection as to where it should be placed in the Bill. Otherwise it would be open to an honorable senator to move a list of eight or ten new clauses in a lump, leaving the responsibility of distributing them to the representatives of the Government. I am not going to take a responsibility of that kind. It may make a considerable difference to the meaning of the measure, whether a certain new clause is put in before or after another clause. I suggest to the honorable senator that the amendment ought not to be inserted here, following upon the track of these prohibited articles. </para>

        <para>The effect of the insertion of this clause will be to considerably increase the amount of revenue paid. to the Customs, and at the same time to put an end to a very important fraud. This is one of the matters that the deputation which waited last week on the Minister for Trade and Customs, brought under his notice. The deputation were under the impression that the honorable gentleman entirely agreed that the provision, in addition to protecting the revenue, would protect the honest from the dishonest trader, and put all on the same footing. All the honest traders are in favour of this clause, and strongly recommend it. To take a particular case to illustrate the difficulty, honorable senators will understand that such goods sis shirts for instance,, are imported in more or less expensive cardboard boxes, and it is in connexion with .shirts that the fraud was first perpetrated. </para>

            <para>- I frankly acknowledge that it is a difficulty. The provision in the State law has never been carried out. The formal declaration which I hold in my hand has been forced upon us. The whole of the trade kicked against it, but either they had to sign or they could not get the goods. All these years the shipping clerks of the various firms have been compelled every time they have gone down almost to sign their name to what they knew to be a lie. </para>

            <para>- No ; those who compel them to do so ought to be in gaol. That provision was passed by Parliament without a knowledge of the facts. A large proportion of the goods came in that way, but the mode in which business is being done in the old country, London becoming more and more every year the centre of commercial matters, is different now. If the Government follow out that plan they will continue to compel shipping clerks every time they go down to sign a lie. </para>

            <para>- Sometimes, you can get the invoice in France. It is not in the case of large transactions that the trouble will arise. I am referring to special transactions in the whole covering a large sum, but individually representing comparatively small sums. In Austria and elsewhere there are small manufacturers who have very little knowledge of business, and their goods are sold through an agent in London. Some of the invoices I have here represent probably goods from four or five manufacturers, although, perhaps, the value does not amount to over £30 or £40. It is an entire change of the trade. </para>

            <para>- No ; I say that what has been should continue, without encouraging or continuing the means of fraud. What the Customs want is the invoice of the price actually paid for the goods, and there is the beginning and end of it. Whether that price is the fair market value or not does not matter one iota. No one can tell. It may be said that the fair market value of certain classes of goods is the value in Leicester, where they are made. But that is not where the goods are bought, in a large number of cases ; they are bought from a house in London. I am speaking now of goods of which I have special knowledge, but the same remark applies to the iron trade and other trades. I strongly urge the Minister to reconsider this matter. The Government are not carrying out what they want, but exactly what they do not want. They will not prevent fraud, but they are legislating to compel the committal of fraud. They want to get the duty on the price paid for the goods, but they are legislating to get something else. They want to protect the honest trader, but they are legislating to protect the dishonest trader. </para>

            <para>- If that is so, the seller is in Germany. But there may have been cases where goods were sold first of all from Germany to London, and then by the merchant in London to the merchant in Australia. What I want to point out is that under clause 150 there is no inconsistency in the words used, because it refers clearly to the invoice of the man who sold the goods in the country whence they were exported. If the honorable and learned senator will look at the new clause he will see that the invoice provided for is the invoice of the seller in the exporting country, and that if the original invoice cannot conveniently be obtained, the collector may permit to be substituted the original invoice prepared and issued by the last seller or consignor. </para>

            <para>- Occasionally they are, but the goods so sold do not represent 5 per cent of the goods imported into this country. Even assuming that these goods are sold in such a way, it must be admitted that they are sold at the then market price in the place from which they are exported. At the end of the season in London prices are reduced, and the reduced price becomes the price at which they can be purchased on the Continent. There is nothing in. the point. </para>

That is the principle followed in some taxation laws, and it is a fair one. I quite agree with the honorable senator that that ought to be confined to cases where there has been an undervaluation, and I am quite willing to strike out the words "or at a certain rate of duty" so that the clause shall read - </para>

            <para>- The importer may value the goods perfectly fairly. He imports them for the purpose of making a profit upon them, and we are now putting an arbitrary power in the hands of the Customs authorities to take any goods that may be imported without question as to whether they have been undervalued or not. The provision deals with any goods "entered as of a specified value," and says "they may at any time before sale to a person having no knowledge of the entry be purchased by the Customs at their declared value." Where there is an honest difference of opinion, and the importer has fairly valued the goods, it is reasonable that this power should be left to the Government to make the addition of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, to the value, so that the importer may not be deprived of the benefits he expects to obtain from the sale of the goods which he has imported, honestly believing that he has valued them at a proper price. </para>

The value for the purpose of imposing taxation is the declared value, with 10 per cent, added. I think Ministers will see that that is so. We have just been passing clauses providing that a man must declare the value of his goods, and the value he is to declare is the price at which he purchased. If we are going to pass this clause as it is we shall give 1 the Government power to take these goods at the price which the person pays for them in the home market. </para>

            <para>.- And principally wars. A merchant or importer orders £1,000 worth of goods in some outside market, and he is entitled to pass those goods through the Customs here at the value which he paid for them with 10 per cent, added. Owing to some international complication or breaking out of hostilities, or flood, famine, or other contingency, however, those goods may, at the time the entry is passed, be worth 50 per cent, more than when he purchased them, but he is not required to pay duty on that 50 per cent. He is only to pay on the price he gave for the goods, plus 10 per cent. Yet under this clause the Government can seize the goods and obtain the profit due to the increase in value that has accrued. The amendment provides for something move than an undervaluation, because if there is a mistake or misapprehension as to which division of the Tariff certain goods come under, they may be seized, inasmuch as the Customs department can say they should have been entered under such and such a heading. </para>

          <para>- The more I consider this proposal the more I dislike it. We have already made provision for what is desired, and I can see no reason for the proposed new clause, which only helps the dishonest man. It is said that if there' should be any undervaluation in the opinion of the Customs officers, the Government should have power to seize. The moment the goods are seized and placed in the King.'s warehouse the Government will be entering into speculation. The goods may rise or fall in value. The provision is altogether unnecessary and unwise. All we have to do if a man has made an unfair declaration is to seize the goods and sell them, and let the man receive the price minus the duty.

          <para>- There is an old saying to the effect that you cannot have too' many strings to your bow; and, as one who has had a good deal to do with the administration of the Customs, I think it is wise to have as many checks against defrauding the revenue as possible. There may be instances of where the Minister cannot say that an importer is honest, while he cannot say that he is dishonest; but he may believe that the importer is getting his goods in at lower than a fair rate. The importer cannot be proceeded against under the criminal provisions of the measure, .but it can be proved to a certain extent that he is introducing goods into the Commonwealth below their value. With this power in his hands the Minister can try a few cases occasionally, taking the goods at their declared value, selling them, and seeing what the result is. </para>

          <para>- I have a new clause which I wish to insert in the Bill. There is provision made in clause 160, under which in the event of a dispute as to duty, the owner of the goods will be compelled to go to the Supreme Court, or instead of that, under clause 256 he may submit the matter in dispute to the sole and final decision of the Minister. Honorable senators will see that there are thus only two alternatives. In the one instance a man must absolutely submit the matter to the Minister for his sole decision, and in the other he must go to the Supreme Court. There are a large number of cases of honest dispute between the Customs and importers which do not justify the excessive expenses of a lawsuit, nor would it be wise that they should be left to the Minister. I therefore propose that there shall be a medium course, and I have circulated an amendment which is a copy, boiled down, of sections 38 to 46 of the Victorian Act, No. 1081. I move - </para>

            <para>- The wording is substantially the same, the only difference being that the earlier part of clause 184 included the words "goods subject to the control of the Customs"; the later words would probably import the expression. And it is not denied - in fact, it is admitted that ships' stores on oversea vessels, whether British or foreign, on the high seas are not subject to the control of the Customs. That being ,so, it would be impossible under the original clause to attempt to enforce what is desired. Therefore clause 184a undoubtedly raises the question in a very clear and precise form, because it is unqualified. It can only have effect upon the ships' stores of foreign-going vessels, and it makes an act which must necessarily be done on the high seas, outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, an offence, because the evidence of it is visible when she arrives in port. That is the situation so ' far as the intended effect of the proposed new clause is concerned. Undoubtedly we are in a different situation from that in which we were as separate colonies. A vessel going from a port of one colony to a port" of another was difficult to be reached in regard to customs duties, because it would be impossible to say which colony should receive the duties. Very much the same difficulty will exist still if we come to consider the practicability of carrying out this intention, because during the five year period of bookkeeping, at any rate, it will be impossible to say to which State the duties upon the stores consumed between ports should be credited. But this is by the way. Other, and perhaps equally if not more serious practical difficulties may arise in connexion with these stores. And, so far as I can ascertain, it will be very doubtful indeed whether the gain to the revenue will be at all' commensurate with the inconvenience, the trouble, and the expense which will be involved in attempting to so collect the duties. Then again, I think we shall all be agreed that it is desirable to collect duties of customs upon all goods we legitimately can reach. Whichever side of the House we belong to, or whatever views we may hold in that respect, so long as there are customs duties imposed, we desire to increase the receipts from every possible legitimate channel. There is another thing upon which we agree, and that is that we should, as far as possible, see that no injustice is done to Inter-State coasting steamers. That is, that there should be no greater facilities for competition permitted to oversea ships in regard to the coasting trade than are given to Commonwealth vessels engaged in the' same trade. If I felt that the omission of such a clause as this would do an injustice to the coasting steamers, I certainly should not be found entering a protest against it. What we ought to ask ourselves is, can we levy duties of customs on the ships' stores of an outward bound British or foreign vessel taken on board in her home port of departure, and consumed on the high seas, simply because in the course of her voyage to her port of destination she calls at intermediate Australian ports. If we can levy these duties, if the customs laws of the Commonwealth can reach the stores of these vessels, let us directly enact what we mean in terse terms, such as - </para>

            <para>- Surely my honorable friend would not object to them carrying perishable articles. If you object to their carrying passengers or goods in competition with your coasting steamers, then put a stop to it ; but do not use that as an indirect reason for imposing a penalty in respect to what is a perfectly lawful act on their part. As regards the intercolonial steamers, it is a singular and significant circumstance that they have never petitioned this House or the other branch of the Commonwealth Parliament in favour of imposing duties upon the stores of oversea ships. </para>

            <para>- Then, there is an end of the whole discussion. But I say - " Nothing of the kind." When we are discriminating between two classes of ships, we say to the coastal steamer - " We will not allow you to take goods on board duty free, but we treat those goods as though they were consumed on land within the borders of the Commonwealth." I quite agree with that. But we say to the foreign-going ship-" The merchants of Australia can sell you all the stores you require in bond- " </para>

It makes a difference on the bulk of consumption but it makes little or no difference on the cost of the liquor. Do honorable senators think that it would stop a passenger from travelling by a P. and O. steamer from Fremantle to Melbourne if he had to pay a little' more for his grog on board by reason of the Commonwealth charging the duty ? If we want to stop competition, let it be done directly. What we are dealing with now is the restriction of trade. Are we encouraging trade by telling steamers either that they must not call at Fremantle, or that if they call they will be immediately harassed by having to make inventories of their stores, and by having to get these signed and delivered ; that they must again make inventories in Adelaide and in Melbourne, and then pay the duty upon the stores consumed within our waters ? This will be an inconvenience, an expense, and an interference with trade which we all wish to encourage, and we should pause before introducing it. Then, too, let us remember that in the case of the P. and O. and Orient steamers we compel them to call at Fremantle under their mail contracts. </para>

            <para>- It is because they call that; we make them pay the duty. Suppose they say - "Rather than be bothered with its troublesome inventory business, we do not desire to call at Fremantle." They are, however, faced with that condition in their mail contracts. It seems to me that we are offering them an encouragement not to call at intermediate ports. This is looked upon asa possibility in Adelaide. It is considered possible that the mail steamers will pass by that port altogether. I can tell my honorable friends that there is a good deal of feeling on that subject, arising from this and other causes. It is felt that this provision will be an inducement to. the big mail steamers to go direct from Fremantle to Melbourne or to Sydney, without touching at Adelaide at all; and everything we do in this direction is an additional deterrent. </para>

            <para>- I do not know whether it is an imaginary fear but often fears that look so imaginary turn out to be fears in reality . Even if they, do not,, it is these fears acting; on the minds of the people that make them discontented with changes in public affairs. I hope we shall abstain from doing what we admit we cannot do honestly; if I may use that expression. We cannot compel these ships to pay duty on the stores consumed on the high, seas. We dare not. put such a provision in the Bill, because in all probability, if we did, the Royal assent to it would be postponed, if not withheld.. But we do it by saying; that upon the arrival of a vessel at her port of destination with the Customs seals broken- lawfully broken on the high seas - she is to be deemed to have committed an offence. It is only in that way that we. can compel these vessels to pay duties which otherwise we should not be able to charge. If we take the words of this clause - a vessel which is bound, to "any other port within the Commonwealth " - what do they mean? I do not wish to go into details, but does it mean direct to any other port, or does it mean vessels calling at another port of the Commonwealth after having called somewhere else? Take the case of vessels going, from Fremantle to Port Darwin, and calling at Singapore on the way. Suppose a vessel has her stores sealed in Fremantle; and that she arrives at Port Darwin, after having called at Singapore, with her seals broken. Are we to penalize that vessel ? How. are we to deal with, vessels that come from New Zealand and touch at other ports? We cannot deal with them at all. The whole thing will be a fiasco, and it seems to me will cover us with the odium of an admitted injustice, because we shall be carrying out a provision with a view of getting duties which otherwise the goods would not, be liable to. If I can be shown that these duties are payable in respect of the stores consumed on the high, seas on board these vessels- over which we have no jurisdiction - then I say "put on any penalty you like." But it is now admitted that the goods, are. not liable to duties when they are consumed on the high seas ; and if they are not liable to duties they should not be sealed up, and it should not be made the subject of a penalty for a vessel to arrive with her seals broken in consequence of the consumption of goods on the' high seas, where they may be lawfully consumed. To put a provision of this Sort in. the Bill is a great mistake! It is an interference with trade and an interfere ence with international obligations, which we should always respect. The provision will, in my view'; be a dead letter if it is inserted. The total amount of' duties in respect of goods consumed on vessels is estimated to be something like £50,000 on £60,000, and the estimate of the amount which we are likely to derive from the goods consumed on sea-going vessels is £10,000 or £15,000. The inconvenience, trouble, and expense involved in getting at these' duties will be enormous, interference with trade will be great, and the inconvenience and expense to ship-owners will be very considerable indeed. I hope, therefore, that proposals which will have the effects I have indicated will not be persevered in. I enter my emphatic protest against the proposal as a blot on the Customs Bill, as creating a serious possibility - or probability I will say - of very grave inconvenience in connexion with the external relations of this Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I prefer the word " skilful." My honorable and learned friend says that the traders of Adelaide are anxious- about- this proposal. He says that they are afraid that foreign-going vessels will not call at Adelaide. Let me put this point to my honorable and learned friend. One section of the- Constitution- says that after the imposition of 'uniform duties, intercourse between the States shall be absolutely free. Our shipping friends in Adelaide may say to my honorable and learned friend - " Why did you not vote for a clause which, would bring about freedom of intercourse by putting foreign-going vessels on the same terms as those upon which we have to trade ? Why should you handicap us and deprive us of that very freedom of intercourse which the Constitution gives to us " ? The Inter-State vessels and the foreign vessels will all be coasting vessels so far as this measure is concerned, just' like the vessels coasting between Melbourne and Warrnambool, or Sydney and Newcastle, and will all get their stores on the same terms so far as the payment of duty, is concerned. My honorable and learned friend has said that the breaking of the seals on the high seas will be a matter outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and that the imposition of a penalty for so doing will be illegal. But we do not impose a penalty for breaking the seals outside the limits of the Commonwealth. We seal the goods when a vessel comes into one of our ports, and we say that if that vessel enters another port with her seals open, it is an offence. The vessel need not come to the other port, but if she does so for the purpose of carrying passengers, getting freight, and competing with Australian ships, and arrives with her seals broken, she commits an offence. Is there any probability that vessels will cease to trade with our ports if this provision is in force ? Certainly not. We want to encourage these traders coming here. Let us look at what the practical outcome will be if this clause is carried. As soon as this measure receives the Royal assent I take it that the Minister for Trade and Customs will within a very short time come to an arrangement with the shipowners. He will settle with them fair and reasonable terms, and they will recognise that there is no intent or desire on the part of the Commonwealth to handicap them, but simply to put them on the same terms as our own vessels. Suppose that it is questionable whether we can charge on any goods consumed between one port and another when a vessel is outside the limits of the Commonwealth, there can be no doubt with regard to goods consumed when the vessel is in Sydney or in Hobart, or in any other port. It is quite likely that the Minister for Trade and Customs will arrange with them that no charge shall be made for any goods consumed outside the 3-mile limit. But some of the vessels stay for a night in Sydney, 48 hours in Hobart, perhaps a week in Melbourne and so on. Altogether they consume a considerable quantity of goods within the 3-mile limit and should pay upon those goods. </para>

            <para>- As the interpretation clause says that the "collector " means the errand boy, the boatman, and almost every one else in the service, I dare say the interpretation clause does cover that. I hope there will be no attempt made to press this matter in the form in which it is now submitted. One point that has not been mentioned is that if these large ocean-going boats that carry our mails have to pay a larger sum in respect to their ships' stores consumed, say, between the first port of call, Fremantle, and Sydney, their last port, I suppose the Commonwealth will have to pay a larger mail subsidy. I take it for granted that the cost of the services will be reckoned in connexion with any contract that is tendered for, and when offering to carry our mails at so' much per annum the extra charge that will be placed upon the vessels in respect to their stores will have to be considered. We' know that these companies do not pay stupendous dividends - 5 per cent, per annum is the most that any of them pay, and they do not as a rule pay more than -3 per cent. I do not suppose that the P. and O. and Orient companies pay more than 21/2 per cent, per annum. We know that year after year the Orient Company never paid a "bean" to their shareholders, and I do. not think I am very far out if I put down the earnings in each case at something like 3 per cent. If we are going to penalize them with £100 for each port - for that is what it comes to, and the question of duties need not be considered - if we are going to impose a penalty of £100 on their coming into each; port- - </para>
