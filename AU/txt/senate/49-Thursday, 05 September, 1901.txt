                    <para>It has become an uncontested principle of modern international law that the sea, as a general rule, cannot be subject to appropriation. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>When international law first came into existence the common European practice with respect to the sea was founded upon the possibility of the acquisition of property in it, and it was customary to look upon most seas as being in fact appropriated. </para>

                <para>Spain asserted dominion over the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. Portugal claimed the Indian Ocean and all the Atlantic south of Morocco. Both powers pushed the exercise of proprietary rights to the extent of prohibiting all foreigners from invading or entering their waters. England claimed dominion over the Channel, the North Sea, the seas outside Ireland, and laid some vague claim to the Bay of Biscay, and to the seas north of Scotland. </para>
                <para>That was the position of affairs when the sixteenth century dawned. Gradually all these alleged appropriations have been swept away, and the sea has been allowed by universal consent to belong to all the nations of the world and to be the world's great highway. It is a pity if Australia in the early days of her career is to break in upon the recognised law of the world - a law which in days to come will be a benefit and a strength to her. We are a growing country. In the course of time we shall have steamers of our own sailing from these ports to the great countries of Europe, and we shall gain advantages from this international law. Our steamers will be allowed to call at British ports one after the other, and no Custom-house officers will there be deputed to do that which we, in this new clause and various clauses that have been passed, seek to do. Although the Government profess to be very confident as to the acceptance of the whole Bill by the Imperial Government ]. do not think they feel absolutely certain on the point, because honorable senators may have noticed that a day or two ago we had a new clause or an addition to an old clause to be proposed by the Government which ran as follows : - </para>

                        <para>- I shall not occupy the time of the committee for many minutes more. I think the information I have given has a useful bearing on the question before us. During the years 1895-6-7, the 'Orient Company paid a dividend of 21/2 per cent. In 1898 it paid nothing, and in 1899 the dividend reached 3 per cent. So that during the last ten years the dividends paid by the company have averaged very little over 1 per cent. I am not able to give exact returns concerning the other companies, because their Australian trade is supported by trade in the more populous parts of the world, where a more profitable business is carried on. I can assure the committee that, taking the aggregate, the great companies whose ships visit Australia pay for stores, for coal, for port dues, and other charges in Australia, something like £2,000,000 a year.. That is not a haphazard guess. I can tell the committee also that within the course of a few days an authoritative statement will be published by the companies concerned, indicating how much each company does spend in Australia. The presence of the oversea companies in Australia is a strength and not a weakness to the coasting lines. The oversea steamers bring them cargo, which they carry to other parts, and in many ways help to sustain and make profitable the trade of the coasting companies. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how much money is spent by the InterState companies. I presume the total does not reach as much as is spent by the oversea companies, though I have no doubt it is a very large sum. This clause is put before the committee on the ground that a serious injustice is likely to be done to the InterState companies if the oversea companies are allowed to carry passengers round our coast's. I' would gladly, if it could be arranged, put all the companies on the same footing as regards the duties they pay. But I want to disabuse the committee of the idea that there exists so serious a competition that it can only be met by a breach of international law. That is the only ground upon which I am putting forward these facts. I take it that there are many reasons why we should be careful not to put any clause in this Bill that might cause it to be hung up, and the Tariff probably to be delayed for some time. </para>

                        <para>- Everybody must know that that result may be brought about, and it ought not to be described by any honorable senator as a bogy. What will happen if this Bill does not become law? I presume that the Tariff Will be hung up indefinitely-. That would cause a great deal of trouble and annoyance. I am quite certain, however, that the Imperial Government will do its best to accept the Bill if the objections to it are not too overwhelming. But is Australia to enter upon its nationhood as a petted child Legging an indulgent mother for that which it is not entitled to under the law of the whole world? The more manly course is for Australia to recognise the standing international law of the world, and not to ask for anything to which it is not reasonably entitled under such law. </para>

                        <para>- Well I cannot elaborate the argument for the honorable and learned senator any further. What I want to point out with regard to New Zealand is that under this clause we shall treat boats owned in New Zealand and registered there exactly on the same footing as the P. and O., Orient, and German and French lines of boats, and New Zealand enters into the competition. What will follow upon the passing of this clause immediately will be that any boat owned and registered in New Zealand will upon arrival at her first port in the Commonwealth have her stores sealed down, and so long as she trades from port to port within the Commonwealth those stores will have to remain sealed down and may not be used duty free. I think it worth while to point out to the committee that retaliation on the part of New Zealand may speedily ensue with regard to ships owned in Australia, and trading in New Zealand, and they will immediately suffer as the result of passing this clause. Although honorable senators may feel that they are conferring a widespread benefit upon Australian - owned boats, it is clear that in one small instance, at all events, they are going to harass and impede them ; and with regard to all Australian-owned boats trading in New Zealand waters, retaliation will necessarily follow, and they will trade from port to port in New Zealand on terms which are not so advantageous as they enjoy at the present time. If honorable senators choose to exercise foresight, they may see the position in which they may be put in the future. If the Australian shipping industry ever does grow to a large extent, and we all hope it will, so long as we have a clause like this upon our statute-book, we may expect retaliation to follow wherever our ships go. If our ships trade even in the waters of Great Britain, if Great Britain could stoop to legislation of this sort, retaliatory legislation may follow there. </para>

I say I do not approve of measures like this, because I consider them illegal and unconstitutional, and a bait of £15,000 a year in revenue will never tempt me by legislation to do what I believe to be illegal. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable and learned senator has admitted, and must admit, that the breaking of these seals as soon as a ship gets outside the 3-miles limit is a perfectly legal act. Yet he is quite prepared to say that an offence has been committed because a ship arrives in port with the seals broken. That is the position of the honorable senator and of all why support the Government. If they are prepared to run that risk let them do so ; my concern is simply to enter my protest against legislation of this sort wherever it occurs. It seems to me to be an attempt to do something by a devious and indirect method unworthy of legislation. If it can be done directly, why not do it? Why not introduce a clause in this Bill providing that duties shall be paid on goods carried by all these foreign ships while they are going from port to port? The Government can make the clause perfectly simple in that way, and there will be no occasion for any cunning device in regard to the breaking of seals. If we want to make this provision why not do it straightforwardly, and say that we will make stores on all these boats dutiable? Instead of that the Government attempt by a cunning device to secure their object, simply because they want to save local ships from competition and because they wish to secure £15,000. </para>

At the risk of being deemed egotistical, I would say that this new clause has been drafted practically at my suggestion, and, therefore, any interruption during my speech, when I only intended to speak briefly, seemed to me to be not well deserved. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite willing to admit that the honorable and learned senator is sorry now that he used that word. In my opinion, however, it exactly fitted the case. The Government cannot impose duties on ships' stores, unless they do it in the way of a penalty when the vessels come within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. I am not opposed to duties being levied on ships' stores if it can be legally done, but I am convinced that it cannot. If this clause is lost," we must extend exactly the same law to Inter-State boats, and allow them to carry their stores free of duties. I do not think the Government or any one else would make the preposterous assertion that we should differentiate against our own shipping. Other nations are encouraging their mercantile marine, and we cannot impose a penalty against our own boats. </para>

                        <para>- There have been none of those international complications which some honorable senators would lead us to believe this clause would involve. I would draw attention to the fact that it is not merely as a protection to our own Australian shipping, nor to confer any particular advantage upon them that this clause is proposed. Honorable senators should recognise that in legislating as we are in this Commonwealth Parliament, we are legislating for the whole of Australia as one fiscal area, and that what could formerly be done legitimately in the States, taking each as a single fiscal area, can be done by the Commonwealth Parliament in legislating for the whole. We are conferring upon our Customs officers certain duties for the purpose of protecting the revenue. If the master of any vessel, whether it belongs to Australia or the ports beyond Australia, chooses to attempt to nullify those deliberate efforts on the part of the Customs officers to protect our revenue, whether they do so within a port of the Commonwealth, or within or beyond the 3-mile limit, we shall be in a position to say that a penalty shall be imposed upon them under this clause.. It is for these reasons and not for that suggested by honorable senators who oppose this clause, namely, that it is purely for the purpose of putting our own coasting shipping on terms of equality with foreign boats with whom they enter into competition </para>

                    <para>- I am sure that honorable senators have no desire to act in an unfair or unjust way. The whole tenor of this debate has been to show that a wide difference of opinion exists between certain honorable senators, first as to whether we can legally do what we seek to do ; and, secondly, if we can, whether as a matter of policy or prudence it is wise to do it. I conceive the law to be that once" a ship gets beyond the 3 miles limit she is absolutely beyond the control of our. Customs jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>- While we recognise that, possibly we may not be able to do that we go on to say - " If you come into port with the seal broken, that shall be an offence for which you shall pay a penalty of £100." You might just as well say "we shall punish a ship coming into port for the loss of some spars." It would be just as right for you to inflict a penalty for an offence of that character as it is for the offence which this clause proposes to create: When I submitted an amendment to clause 122, providing that these stores should be given to all ships, I said that I took that course because I did not consider that we could get at oversea ships, and I did not wish to handicap our coasters as against oversea ships. The committee, by a large majority, would not accept the amendment to permit free stores being given to Inter-State, ships ; and there were honorable senators who were prepared to say - "While we cannot get this sum of £15,000 from the oversea ships, we can get the sum of £45,000, which we think we are entitled to, from the InterState ships." My position was entirely different from theirs. Believing that we could not get this revenue from oversea ships, I thought that we ought to ( free our own ships. Of course it is impossible to predict whether a Bill of this character, in consequence of its containing this clause, will be reserved or refused the Royal assent. But we want to be satisfied that we have the legal right to collect customs duties on stores consumed on ships outside our territorial limits. Once we are satisfied that there is a power to do that by law, the Government have made out a very strong case, but the wording of their own clause shows that they do not hold that belief. A portion of the original clause 184 was withdrawn because the Government did not think that it was sufficiently clear and distinct to catch oversea ships. It read as follows : - and if any ship shall arrive in any port with any such fastening, lock, mark, or seal open, altered, broken, or erased, except as aforesaid the master shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. </para>

                    <para>- I notice that some honorable senators who oppose this clause think that they have discovered a remedy for getting out of the difficulty of placing foreign ships in an unduly favorable position, as compared with local steamers, by exempting both classes of ships from duty on their stores. But the remedy they propose will only create a greater difficulty, because the moment we commence to make exemptions in favour of shipping, there will be any number of other persons who will claim that they have a greater reason for exemptions. I have no doubt that people living in out of the way back blocks will claim that they should be exempted from revenue duties as well as those who are interested in shipping. Such exemptions would create difficulties innumerable. We have no idea of the extent to which they would go. </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, clause 1S4a is absolutely needless. What does the amendment mean ? That, although the ships' stores are sealed, arrangements, may be made by means of which stores which are wanted may be consumed between two ports subject to the payment of duty. That is all we want. </para>

                        <para>- The object is that we shall be able to inflict penalties upon any oversea ship which has consumed stores while on the high seas. The clause is an attempt to do, in a skilful way perhaps, what we know we cannot do fairly, squarely, and openly. Any clandestine method of that sort, however skilfully devised, is liable to land us in a great deal of difficulty. Therefore, I shall vote against the proposed new clause. </para>

                        <para>- It is possible she would be. I can speak with some little knowledge, when I say that on the Queensland coast we have vessels trading to China and Japan, and those vessels would be very much inconvenienced by this clause. It is not merely that they would be inconvenienced, but passengers going by those boats as far as Thursday Island and to Port Darwin, will find this quite a new departure for them. It is difficult enough now to get people to go up there, but if we are going to increase the expense, I do not know what is to become of this Northern Territory, where during the last ten years, I believe, the population has been decreasing. </para>

                    <para>I am further of opinion that Parliament has a perfect right to say to foreign ships that they shall not, without complying with the British law, enter into British ports ; and that if they do enter they shall be subject to penalties, unless they have previously com plied with the requisitions ordained by the British Parliament. Whether those requisitions be, as in former times, certificates of origin, or clearance of any description from a foreign port, or clean bills of health, or the taking on board a pilot at any place in or out of British jurisdiction before entering British waters. Whether the Parliament has so legislated is now the question to be considered. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, under the Customs Act. The foundation of that law is that, for the protection of the revenue, it has been necessary to enact that penalties shall be imposed for doing something, or failing to do something, which is necessary for the protection of the revenue, even although that something has been done or omitted a long way beyond the 3 miles which is generally supposed to be the territorial limit of the authority of any country. That principle also rests in other legislation. In the Merchants Shipping Act 1854 it is provided that - </para>

                        <para>- That is not the matter I am dealing with now. That being the general effect of the common law in regard to warehouse certificates, is it necessary for the Commonwealth by a Customs Act to interfere in any way in the dealings with the certificates? It would be a rather serious departure from the principle of attending simply to what concerns the re venue, or such matters of health and public welfare as we have dealt with already in regard to prohibited goods. This is really part of the mercantile law. It ought to be left to the mercantile law. It is very much better to simply confine this Bill within the limits we have laid down, and leave this question to be settled by legislation in the States or by the ordinary rules of the common law. Then there is this difficulty to be considered. The effect of a warehouse certificate, how it is to be dealt with, how the property passes with it is a matter of State legislation. Of course we can enact as to what is to be done, by our Customs officials, but we cannot by a side wind alter the law in regard to these particular documents, simply because they happen to pass through the hands of our Customs officials in any way. </para>

                        <para>- I presume he decides finally. He would have the responsibility of decision. The reason I give that answer is that it is necessary to distinguish between a certain class of cases and others. As a matter of practice, the following rule has been carried out to a large extent : A dispute may arise between two persons as to the amount of duty properly chargeable. The matter is decided by the collector in the first instance. Then the party interested writes a letter to the department : complains that a mistake has been made by the collector, and that the Minister ought to take a certain view of it. The Minister may then send for the collector, or appoint an expert to inquire into the matter ; or he may send for the person himself, and have a conversation with him about the matter. He may take any steps he thinks fit to ascertain the facts. Then he decides the matter, and either remits or imposes a fine. In the latter case, the party has his remedy in the court. If he thinks the Minister has acted improperly, he can proceed to law. That is the practice at present. The Minister of Customs, like any other person at the head of a department, is responsible for the actions of his officers, and can undo the action of any of them. On representations made to him as the head of the department, he inquires, and if he thinks the official concerned has acted hastily or improperly, then that officer's decision is reversed. Clause 256 proposes to establish that practice into a recognised legal tribunal. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it shows the futility of the proceeding. It is a wrong principle to hand over- the practical administration of the Customs to a board, and it is not necessary, because you have first of all the tribunals of the country to which everybody may have resort, and if you do not wish, to go to the ordinary tribunals then you have either the proceeding before the Minister, where there has been a contravention of the law, or the proceeding which I intend to propose, where there has not been a contravention of the law. We would overload the Bill with unnecessary procedure if we inserted this provision, spend a large amount of money unnecessarily, and hamper and delay the operations of the Custom-house and the importers, and weaken the strength and the uniformity of administration' which is absolutely essential' in Customs dealings. That brings me to another objection, and a very strong one. This proposal contemplates the constitution of a board of three commissioners in each State. You cannot have uniformity of decision about these things unless the cases are all submitted to' the Minister. </para>

                        <para>- Yes : the law is laid down uniformly. Under this proposal in New South Wales you would have one decision as to a duty or rate of duty, or a class, in Victoria another- decision, and in Queensland another. Unless all the decisions were brought continually under the review of the Minister, how would you have uniformity ? If decisions are to be given in every part of Australia- do you get any "-forrader." For these reasons I think that' the Bill had better be 'left as it is? </para>

                        <para>- But it must be remembered that in New South Wales they have not had many duties. In Victoria we have had a large number of duties. Hence the necessity for seeing that the Act is properly administered. In Victoria, the decisions that have been given would fill a very large volume. Years ago they were very voluminous, and necessarily must be so. If it is felt to be necessary that there should be an intermediate course between the experts on the one side, and leaving ourselves absolutely in the hands of the Minister, who may make the most egregious mistakes, I suggest that what lias been the- law in Victoria should be embodied in this measure. The question is, what kind of a board should be appointed ? My amendments follow the ninth section of the Victorian Act, condensed so as to bring it into harmony with the wording of this Bill. I provide that there shall be a board of two or three members. I do not approve of the boards being paid. Such boards have frequently been utilized in "Victoria in past years, and on no occasion have they been paid. It will be a mistake also to have only one board. One board could not possibly know all the intricacies and niceties in connexion with different classes of goods. There needs to be power in the hands of the Minister to say - " Such and such a dispute has occurred in the drapery trade, or in the ironmongery trade, or , in the grocery trade,, and such and such men, who are experts, shall be appointed a board to deal with it." This is following out the principle of what are called on the continent, and also in London, tribunals of commerce. A large number of commercial disputes have been settled in this way, by experts in the' various trades being called upon to deal with them. In London, during the last six years, this system has been put in operation, and honorable senators would be perfectly astonished at the large number of cases which have been settled in a few hours, which would formerly have been tried by the law courts and token months to settle. </para>

                        <para>- Because the principles are not settled, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The proposition of the Government is that the Minister may inquire. That he may and does do now. If the Collector of Customs of South Australia, for instance, gives a decision, the duty is thrown upon him by statute, but his Treasurer overhauls him and inquires into the matter. If the Treasurer disagrees with him, the decision is altered or reversed, as the case may be. Therefore all that is proposed in the Government amendment is a re-enactment of the existing practice that the Government, who are the ultimate judges, shall inform their minds in the way they think fit. </para>

                    <para>- I should be very much inclined to say "a plague on both your houses " and on both your amendments ; because, within my experience in the management of Customs business - having passed the present Tariff in South Australia, and having had the administration of it for some years - nothing of the sort is wanted. Necessarily a new Tariff requires a considerable amount of interpretation after it is first inaugurated. It can be well imagined that all sorts of disputes naturally arise. I had hundreds of cases to decide. There is no law in South Australia which gives direct power to the </para>

                <para>But I point out to the honorable senator that there may be many disputes arising under the Customs Bill which could not possibly come before justices in the ordinary sense. The dispute I referred to in connexion with the classification of chicory was one which could never have come before a justice at all. That portion of the clause will, therefore, have to be reconsidered before we can put it into the Bill.

                        <para>- Probably, but not necessarily. We might say " after hearing the parties if they so desire." I know that in the administration of the Crown Lands Act in South Australia, it was found advisable to have a provision to enable the parties in a matter to be heard and they were heard in many cases by a declaration or a statement made in writing, and if the Minister chose he might hear them orally. That would secure absolute justice, I think, and I should be content with the administration of this Customs' Bill, if after the Minister informed his mind of the circumstances, the parties to a dispute could come before him if they thought fit. </para>

It would be such if he refused to hear both sides. However, that is going into a question of law which is unnecessary. I am opposed to the suggested amendment, because it seems to me that it would take away the usefulness of this power. After all, we must remember that the person aggrieved is not forced to accept this tribunal. If he chooses to go to it, however, he must be prepared to trust to the Minister's sense of right and justice.

                    <para>- It is an extraordinary argument to use, to say that we shall be overloading this Bill by inserting this clause in it, after honorable senators have spent hours in discussing amendments of their own. They cannot get amendments in the shape in which they want them, and therefore they say that no such proposal is required at all. Those who take the view that there should be some way by which cases which need not go into court may be decided by a clause of this kind, will vote for it as it stands. </para>

                        <para>- It will be remembered that paragraph (a) of this clause originally classed amongst prohibited imports any work which is, or appears to be, an infringement of copyright. That was amended in committee by introducing practically the provision in the Victorian Act. I promised at the time to look into the matter, and, if necessary, to recast the clause so as to bring it into conformity with the desire of the committee in passing that amendment as to the shape it should take. I have drafted a new paragraph to meet that view, and at the same time it is made to include any kind of work as well as a book. All modern legislation is in that direction. The word " book " is used in the Victorian Act but it is intended to include drawings and photographs and matters of that kind. In addition to that, the clause as it stood originally protected only copyrights in Australia or in the United Kingdom. I propose to enlarge that provision by extending it to copyrights in any part of the King's dominions. I move - </para>

The form has been altered, because in all these forms in the statutes a very clumsy method has been adopted of putting in the first place the thing which it is not desired to prohibit, and inserting in the second place that which it is desired to prohibit.

                    <para>- We are not being treated fairly in this matter. I am sure the Minister does not desire to treat us unfairly, but the proceedings are operating in that direction. We are dealing with a provision which has been amended. We cannot possibly carry all the amendments in our heads, and we ought to have a print of the Bill, showing the way in which the clauses have been amended already. This paragraph has been amended, but I can not remember in what way. My honorable and learned friend, after consideration, proposes to make it more perfect by a further amendment; but we cannot tell how that will operate. We might as well be out of the chamber. It is simply making a farce of considering these amendments, and making fresh ones upon them, unless honorable senators have a Bill in front of them showing the alterations which have been made already. We might have had the Bill reprinted in advance, omitting the new clauses, or something of that kind. Certainly it is impossible for us to tell what the effect of this suggestion is. We wish to facilitate the passage of this Bill ; but still, I think, some consideration ought to be given to honorable senators. Before amendments are made on clauses which have been amended already in committee, we should have the clauses as amended before us. </para>

                        <para>- I am very anxious that the committee shall have every opportunity of considering these amendments. The amendment we are now dealing with is only a verbal one. I have read the paragraph as it stood, and I have read what I propose, and I have undertaken that the Bill will be reprinted and circulated amongst honorable senators before the third reading, so that they will have an ample opportunity of reconsidering all these clauses. If it is found that there is any clause which needs further amendment, inasmuch as it does not carry out the intention of the committee, then it can be recommitted. I shall not object to any clause being recommitted under such circumstances. If that course is not taken it will be necessary to defer the consideration of the Bill until next week. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the Chairman will have to go through the Bill and certify to it before it goes to the printer, and will be impossible to have it reprinted by to-morrow. If the course I propose is followed, there will be no difficulty in the way of placing the Bill, as reprinted, before honorable senators on Monday or Tuesday. I ask them to grant this concession, for the purpose of advancing the consideration of this measure by at least a day. I appeal to honorable senators, who I know are anxious to see the Tariff introduced to help me by going through the Bill to-night and to-morrow ; trusting to the reconsideration of the clauses as a whole on Tuesday. They will have ample time before Wednesday, for which day, I hope, the third reading will be fixed, to see whether it requires any alteration. </para>

                    <para>- On one or two of the clauses which are recommitted there is a possibility of considerable discussion taking place. For instance with regard to clause 150 relating to the genuine invoice, a deputation waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs again to-day. The chairman of the deputation waited upon me just before dinner, and said that so far as they could see, they had impressed the Minister with the necessity of the amendment being made, which I moved, but which the committee would not agree to. </para>

                    <para>- It would be a great saving of time if we could have a reprint of the Bill. But, as the thing stands at the present time, it would be very much better for us to let the Minister make the amendments right through on the understanding that the clauses may be recommitted, because we cannot possibly criticise them, if they are open to criticism. In all probability a number of them are not open to criticism, but one or two of them are, I can see. I would suggest to the Minister that he should give us until to-morrow to consider the list we have before us. </para>

                        <para>- That being so we are running the risk of having the same danger here if our legislation in regard to mineral oils is limited to this machinery Bill passed by the Commonwealth Parliament. Therefore, I feel inclined to think that the safer course would-be to leave the matter entirely out of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- 1 do that because in the. opinion of those who understand this question no oil under 120 degrees flash-point is safe in a climate like ours. We know what has happened in the last few days, and what has happened in the old country. This inferior stuff can only be prevented from coming in under a Customs Act, and consequently it can only be done by means of the Commonwealth -Act. It is a matter of such serious moment, involving the ' question of life and death, that we ought even to strain a- point in order to provide that the flash-point of mineral oils shall be not less than 120 degrees. </para>

                    <para>- I suggest that it would be prudent, with the view of affording the committee expert information on the subject, for the matter to bo postponed for inquiry to be made. The matter is one of supreme importance to the public, lt is not at all unlikely that the explosion which took place in Melbourne a few days ago arose from the use of inferior or cheap oil. Some persons say that these explosions arise from using unsafe lamps, but I believe the bulk of them are caused by inferior oil. Another element which is to be considered is that we have provided that all tea shall be examined by experts before it goes into consumption. It is equally necessary in the interests of the safety of human life that all oils shall be examined by experts before they are allowed to be imported. </para>
