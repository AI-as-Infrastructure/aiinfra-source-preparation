The statists have not yet agreed on the figures of the census.

                    <para>. - No doubt it would be possible to administer the Act in such a way that if the minimum were to be fixed higher than the New South Wales minimum, injustice would be done to that State, but my honorable friend will recognise that such administration would be so outrageously unfair that it is impossible to suppose that any Minister responsible to Parliament would be guilty of it. Under the regulations which have been prepared under this portion of the Bill the minimum fixed is below the minimum of some of the States, and in no case is it higher than the lowest minimum in any of them, for the express reason that it has been determined that every State shall be treated fairly. The principle of the amendment has been and will be adopted in the regulations. But if we state in the Act that the minimum is not to be below the minimum in any of the States, it will render it impossible for the Customs authorities to make those convenient arrangements in regard to importations which sometimes may be found necessary. For instance, it may be found that there may be ways of importing and packing these things under certain safeguards which will make it quite consistent with a full care of the revenue that the convenience of shippers should be studied, and they should be allowed to import in small packages. If the amendment is carried I do not know exactly in what position the Customs authorities will stand. It should be left to the fair dealing of the Commonwealth with all the States. There is no possibility of any harm being done now. If there was any intention to make an alteration, of course full provision should be made to deal with the existing condition of tilings by providing for packages on the water, or in transit or under contract. But that is not necessary, because the regulations as actually prepared carry out my honorable friend's view. If it were carried out in any other way we would stereotype things as at the date of the passing of the Act, which I think would be undesirable. </para>

                <para>That the words " and expense " be omitted. </para>
                <para>I called the attention of the committee to this clause on a previous occasion. It has regard to the regauging and remeasuring of goods in warehouses. I felt confident that if I could bring evidence to show honorable senators that lockers do regauge, remeasure, and so forth, they would support me in striking out the words "and expense," for the reason that the licence-fee paid by the warehouseman ought to cover all services done by the locker. When goods first enter a warehouse they are gauged and measured by an expert. The expert then places the measurement on the cask, takes samples, and tests the quality of the liquor. When the goods are required for home consumption, the owner notifies the collector, who may require to have the goods regauged and remeasured for the purpose of fixing the duty. It is the simplest process in the world for the locker to remeasure the quantity of liquor in the barrel, and the remeasurement is sent to the collector to be compared with the previous measurement. Seeing that the process is so simple, and that it is always done in South Australia by the locker, I fail to see, as also do the merchants and warehousemen of South Australia, why they should be called upon to pay twice for the work done by the locker. Since I previously discussed this subject I have visited a warehouse and seen the whole process gone through. I was informed that the locker always does the remeasuring and reweighing, and was shown how his work was checked by the records in the office, so that there is no possible chance of the Government being defrauded. </para>

                    <para>- lt is almost enough to take one's breath away to find that a proposal which was originally made by myself in my second reading speech on the Bill, and' which I repeated and pressed on the Government time after time, is now finally about to be agreed to by the Government in a very roundabout way. I regret we have not had time before this has been presented to us to form an exact opinion as to how these words will stand in relation to the succeeding clauses. I can only congratulate the Government on having at the latest hour taken steps to obviate a great difficulty, and I trust they will see that it does so effectually. </para>

                    <para>- An amendment is necessary in this clause, which is rather too far reaching in its present form. It is a very good rule to be followed in those places where there are Custom-house agents, and where the owners of goods may have a number of employes, of whom one may be detailed to look after the Customs business, that only authorized agents shall be allowed to transact business with the Customs, but in cases where goods may be landed at places where there are not licensed agents inconvenience may be caused.

All the clause as it stands provides is that the Custom-house officer who arrests - say a person, who may be stepping off a ship- on suspicion of having an extra quarter of a pound of tobacco in his pocket, shall give a statement in writing of the reasons for the arrest. </para>

I cannot help repeating what I have said time after time while this Bill has been before us, that there is in it a disregard of the rights of the people, which this Senate ought to be the first to reprobate and to try to avoid. I hope the Senate will insist upon the words taken out remaining out, and that the clause will still provide that an officer who chooses to take the very serious step of" arresting anybody on suspicion shall be required forthwith to give that man a statement in writing of the reason for his arrest- </para>

                    <para>In passing Bills a greater freedom is admitted in proposing questions, as the object of the different stages is to afford an opportunity of reconsideration, and an entire Bill may be regarded as one question which is not decided until it is passed. Upon this principle, it is laid down by Hatsell, and is constantly exemplified, " that in every stage of a Bill every part of the Bill is open to amendment, either for insertion or omission, whether the same amendment has been in a former stage accepted or rejected." </para>

                <para>What took place was that this Bill was reported with amendments to the House. It was then moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council that certain clauses be recommitted. These clauses are recommitted and reconsidered by a fresh committee, and this fresh committee is at perfect liberty to make any amendments it thinks proper, and may even make amendments winch have been dealt with by a former committee. </para>

                    <para>- In the original clause the words " on demand " were used. The ordinary acceptation of the meaning of those words is " immediately." So that what was originally contemplated was that if the man arrested knew the provisions of the Act, and made a demand, he would get a statement at once of the reason for his arrest. </para>

                    <para>- The ordinary rule when a man is arrested is for the constable to tell him at once what is the reason for the arrest, and the .lock-up keeper will not take the man into custody unless he is furnished with a statement of that reason. There is no difficulty in giving a written statement of the reason for which a man is arrested. If a constable arrests a man in the bush, and he has no pen, ink, and paper, he cannot give the particulars in writing until he gets to the lock-up. </para>

                    <para>- Every case will have to depend on the circumstances surrounding it, and to put in the word " immediately " is to get back to all the dangers which appeared to me to arise from the words "on demand." Supposing that the constable has caught, or thinks he has caught, a man smuggling in the middle of the night, and takes him to the lock-up, what is he to do if all the rooms are locked up ? If we use the word " immediately " it means that there and then the officer shall give a written statement to the man. " Immediately" means immediately, and "as soon as practicable " means as soon as the constable can get pen and paper and ink, and find the time to write out a statement of the reasons. Does any honorable senator mean to contend that if an officer has caught one man and taken him to the lockup, and he knows where a confederate is to be found, he is not to run after that man, but is to sit down and write out a statement of his reasons for arresting the other? </para>

                        <para>- There is the difficulty that a merchant may be fined for some small irregularity, and may under this proposal find his name published amongst a list of persons who have really been trying to defraud the revenue. I believe that the amendment now proposed will carry out all that is desired, and what I am emphatic about is that we should have a provision under which all decisions shall be published, because we know that there is a practice in all the States under which some men appear by some little favoritism to be able to have their names kept out of the papers when the names of other persons are published. </para>

I am quite certain we all desire to see that there shall be publicity, but at the same time I think we recognise the very great usefulness of a tribunal of this sort, and recognise also that it may have to deal with cases, if it is to be useful at all, which cannot be conducted with the formality which is provided here. We must never forget that the party only enters this tribunal if he thinks fit, and if he does, and we safeguard the interest of the public by the publicity of the order, that is really all we want to do. </para>

                        <para>- No, for a contravention of the Act. The Commissioner insisted upon my dismissing that young man. I thought it was a most cruel thing to do, because the mistake was absolutely unintentional. If a matter of that sort had been inquired into in open court, the public would have seen at once that it was a pure mistake. Constant differences of opinion occur in which there is not an atom of criminality. The officer may think from his surroundings that he is being got at, and that there is a contravention of the Act, but the evidence which would be produced would be so unmistakable that the public would see that it was an ordinary accident which might happen in any case. I can give another illustration : In the days when these inquiries were remitted to the Minister and held privately, the Minister fined a merchant £1,000. Those who knew of the transaction were under the impression that the fine to meet the case ought to have been nearer £5,000. That very same night the Minister dined at the house of the man who was fined. </para>

                    <para>- What was the good of bringing it before the Western Australian Parliament ? One might as well have talked to the man in the moon. A complaint about an act of administration by such a Government as was then in power in Western Australia would have been laughed out of the chamber. Certain persons for whom I have the greatest respect would have got up, and in the loudest tones possible would have said that justice had been done. That was the method of administration in Western Australia, then. It is quite useless to say that these matters should be brought before Parliament. Does Parlia-ment want to be worried by this kind of thing? We are here for legislative purposes, not to be bothered by all sorts of paltry disputes. The principle involved is a very sound one, namely, that when the Minister is placed in a position of responsibility, and given the power of imposing very large penalties, if the parties desire it the public shall be in the position of not only hearing the decision but of knowing the evidence upon which it is founded. This can only tend to the sound administration of justice, the interest of the public, and the purity of the department. </para>

                    <para>- I only wish to point out, as a very strong reason for supporting the amendment, that there is a broad distinction between disputes or differences in relation to Customs matters that are in contravention of the Act, and disputes not in contravention of the Act. Yesterday, the committee passed a new clause dealing with matters of difference not involving a contravention of the Act - that is, matters of mistake or inadvertency. In those cases, the inquiry may be made by the Minister, who may inform his mind in such manner as he thinks fit, without any publicity at all. That is a perfectly fair position to take in relation to such matters. But this amendment relates to contraventions of the Act, and implies offences wilfully, if . not fraudulently committed. In the case of an inadvertent failure to comply with the measure, there is no reason whatever why there should be publicity, but I certainly agree that there should be publicity, both in the interests of the accused and the department, in cases where a wilful contravention or fraud is implied. It is not necessary to assume that the Minister will be liable to political influences. He may or may not be. But without assuming it, in cases where an importer is alleged to have wilfully defrauded the Customs, it would be very much better for the case to be dealt with by the Minister sitting as a judge, and that full publicity should be given to what takes place. </para>

                    <para>- I think it will be much better not to encumber the Bill with a clause of this kind, which is really going outside its province. All through we have laid down the principle that the Bill shall deal with anything that is necessary for the collection of the revenue, and incidentally it deals with the protection of the public in proclaiming certain goods as prohibited. That is the extent to which we have gone, but this seems to me to be going a good deal further. This would be undertaking to institute a sort of inquiry into the conduct of these agents. If a man is guilty of fraud as an agent, there is a way of dealing with him under the ordinary criminal law. This clause would put the duty upon the Customs authorities of inquiring whether persons were duly authorized to act as agents or not. Why should that burden be put upon them when, if a man who is not authorized acts as an agent, his action does not bind his principal ? </para>

It is for that reason that we refused yesterday to interfere in the matter of warehouse certificates, and on the same principle we should now refuse to interfere here. The object of the proposal is to secure the punishment under the Bill of persons who have not committed a fraud upon the Customs, but who have committed a fraud upon other persons in relation to the Customs. There is no doubt that the Victorian Act may deal with many things winch are beyond the scope of a purely customs law, and that may be quite right where the State has the whole field of legislation to itself. </para>

                    <para>- The principle is really a very simple one, though I admit there may be some little difficulty at times in the application of it. Under section 109 of the Constitution, when a law of the State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. But the law of the Commonwealth only prevails where it is within the powers of the Commonwealth, and if the Commonwealth makes a law upon a subject which it has not the power to deal with, its law in respect to that subject is waste paper. I have not the Victorian Excise Act before me, and am not able to make a statement upon it, but whatever the sections of that Act are, the principle is precisely the same, and those sections which deal with excise, and are necessary to deal with excise, become repealed by the mere fact of the enactment of the Commonwealth law. But those sections which deal with matters outside excise, and are not necessary in order to collect excise, are not repealed by the Commonwealth law. It does not matter in the least whether we put it in this Bill or not. We might say in this Bill that we repeal all State Acts relating to excise, but that would not in the least affect a portion of a State Act which did not relate to excise. If we go beyond the provisions of the Constitution, our enactment is invalid, and if we do not make any statement at all about repealing a State Act, the effect of our Commonwealth enactment, in so far as it is within the powers of the Commonwealth, will be to repeal the local Act. I think that, by the alteration of one word in the clause, the matter might perhaps be made more clear. We might say - </para>

                        <para>- That is so, and it is only for clearness in legislation, and in order to point out to the States, as well as to our own Parliament, what we are doing that it is advisable to have these words. I believe myself that the course followed in the Customs Bill is better, under which there is no reference at all to any other enactment. But there is no reason why this provision should not stand as a statement of the effect of our legislation. If it is put in it is plain that it refers to different sections of different Acts, and it picks out for exclusion only those which relate to excise. </para>

                    <para>- It may be well to follow the Victorian Act sometimes, but we should be careful not to drag in by the head and the heels every section from the Victorian Act which we think is likely to fit in with this measure, without properly considering the difference between the framework of the Bill and that of the Victorian Act. It is quite clear that the clause cannot deal with any beer except that which is subject to excise. Parliament may make any beer excisable that it thinks fit, and Parliament would make excisable beer produced, not in a private household, but in the ordinary course of trade. This machinery for the purpose of collecting excise duty is made to apply to all beer subject to excise duty, but it does not make a person who brews beer in his own home liable, unless we provide also for imposing an excise duty upon the beer made in private households. With regard to the change of expression, I have not had the advantage of reading the Victorian Act ; but from what I know in general of its provisions the machinery of the Act is put in a different way altogether from this. The reason for using the words "no person shall make beer, except in pursuance of this Act " is that we do not want only to get at a man who is carrying on a brewery, but at men who may make beer for the purpose of evading payment of duty, and yet may not be carrying on a brewery at all. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that fact. I can recollect the days - 30 years ago - when one bought bottled ale with fear and trembling, but now, I understand, most of our bottled beer is tolerably good. I take it that exporters from foreign countries must take that risk; but here, where the beer goes bad through the effect of the hot climate, and when it is proved to the satisfaction of the collector to have gone bad, according to the principle of this Bill, it is simply a question of the quantity. If out of eight gallons of beer more than one goes bad, no refund can be claimed, although six-eighths of the whole quantity may be unfit for human use, and the brewer may have had to allow for the whole of this beer to the publican.

                        <para>- I hope that the committee will adhere to the decision it arrived at, after very full consideration. It is considered fair that, where practically the whole consignment of beer goes bad, on its return under certain conditions, the brewer shall be entitled to have the duty refunded, and one-eighth is mentioned, because that is considered a very full quantity to allow for practically sampling the beer. But it never was intended that the brewer shall not run the risk of sending away beer which may or may not become bad, that he shall stand absolutely on velvet if it goes bad, and get a return of the duty on so much as is sent back. Is there any reason why he should be treated any differently from a person who imports beer? The importer has paid the duty on his beer before he gets it to distribute.. If the importer gets no consideration from the Customs why should the brewer get any ? It would be almost a premium for carelessness, in sending out beer to the country, if the brewer could get a refund of the duty on whatever quantity was sent back. The brewers will be careful not to send out beer which is likely to go bad, because if they do they will not get a refund of the duty if the badness is not discovered until more than an eighth is consumed. </para>
