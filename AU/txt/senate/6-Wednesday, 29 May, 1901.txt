            <para>- .1 think it will be worth our while to consider the issue on which the general election was fought, and the statements that were made on the same subject during the great contest before the referendum. There is no doubt, broadly speaking, that what is known us the fiscal issue dominated the contest generally throughout Australia, though some exception may be made in the case of the important State of Queensland. </para>

            <para>What the Commonwealth Convention had endeavoured to do was to leave the nation free to adopt its own fiscal policy. This Bill would leave the Commonwealth free to adopt a policy of freetrade or of protection. The fact of the matter was that it rested with the people of the colonies themselves whether a free-trade or protectionist Tariff" was adopted. </para>

              <para>- That also was a clear and definite statement made in view of the referendum to be taken, and nothing has" occurred since then that can possibly alter the position as laid down by those two gentlemen. But in what is known as his Maitland speech, the Prime Minister adopted a new attitude. He said that a change had come, and that the people could not adopt a clear-cut fiscal policy ; that it would have to be something which was a mixture of both policies : and he mentioned that the revenue for last year was about ?7,750,000, figures which he said had not previously been considered when dealing with the subject of federation. But he overlooked the important fact that since the general referendum was taken Queensland, with her revenue of ?1,500,000, had come into the federation, and that that addition of ?1,500,000 made the only practical alteration in the figures before the people of Australia. So that we as a people are quite as free to-day to discuss and decide upon a Tariff in view of the conflicting claims of free-trade and protection, as we were when the question of the referendum was before us. The subject of what is a revenue Tariff and what is meant by a revenue Tariff has been raised. </para>

            <para>Let us be sure in what sense we are using the term free-trade. In its political and controversial sense free-trade simply means the absence of duties of a protective character. It is sometimes used in a wider sense, to denote the absence of all customs duties ; bub this is not the meaning which it bears when it is used in opposition to the term "protection." In that sense it is simply the absence of duties of a protective character. It is no mere pedantry to insist upon this simple definition, because much of the confusion and heat of the controversy between free traders and protectionists arises from neglecting to remember it. </para>

            <para>We do not want to touch duties simply for revenue, but we want to prevent certain parties from having a revenue which is of benefit to themselves, but advantage to none else. On the contrary, what we seek for is the improvement of Her Majesty's revenue ; what we wish to gain is that improvement. </para>

            <para>One of your candidates actually says that freetrade means the abolition of all Customs house duties. We have said, thousands of times, that our object is not to take away the Queen's officers from the Customs house, but to take away those officers who sit at the receipt of custom to take tithe and toll for the benefit of peculiar classes. </para>

            <para>A Customs duty on the import of commodities has to be paid by the domestic consumers of the commodities. The foreign producer will not sell them at less than cost, and the importing merchant will not bring them in unless he obtains his cost, his own fair profit, and the import duty over and above these essential constituents of the transaction. But if the commodity be one of domestic as well as foreign supply, the effect of the Customs duty is to raise the price of the domestic supply in some proportion to the duty ; and the consumer, in so far as the commodity is one of necessity to him, has no choice. He has to pay the tax, with the further dissatisfaction of knowing that it goes to no public purpose, but only into the pockets of some of his own private neighbours. </para>

              <para>- I will refer to that at once. Last week we were twitted with having no leader, and with speaking with varying voices. I venture to say that, if we had been determined at all hazards to force business so that we might obtain office, the first thing we should have done would have been to appoint a leader. </para>

              <para>- Yes, to line up. We did not do so, for the reason that we were all more or less strangers to one another, and we thought we might as well allow a little time to pass until we became better acquainted. We were under no burning necessity to appoint a leader with the view of ousting the Government then and there. That is my answer to the honorable member. </para>

              <para>- Well, I will put it that I wish to make reference to the theory of the fiscal question, the basis of it. I have been referring only to certain facts in regard to the Tariff. I think it is desirable for all of those who want to understand this question, and want to be fair and to recognise what has taken place, to remember that during the reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, the whole of the statesmen who guided the destinies of Great Britain, without a single exception, were free-traders. Peel, Bright, Gladstone, Cobden - all of those whose names have been associated with the . great measures which mark the reign of Her Majesty - were one and all free-traders. </para>

              <para>- Very well, and what does England do ? England takes our produce, and the produce of all her colonies. What a revolution has substantially been brought about in the world by Great Britain's free-trade policy? There are no facts which can be brought forward to equal the wonderful results of her policy of free-trade, and this does not apply alone to Great Britain. If we want to understand what the fiscal policy will . do, or what anything will do, we have to consider it in its fullest sense. No policy like this can be confined in its effects to the country in which it operates. The policy of Great Britain has benefited all the world. Honorable members will find, if they refer to statistics, that in one period of ten years Great Britain bought from the United States ?820,000,000 worth of produce, while the next best customer of the United States purchased only ?129,000,000 worth. You will find that the prosperity enjoyed in Canada is very largely traceable to the great trade done by Great Britain with her. Of ?27,000,000 worth of produce exported from Canada, not less than ?17,000,000 worth was taken by Great Britain. </para>

              <para>- It did no good, but the free-trade policy of New South Wales did good to every colony in Australia, and every country in the world with which it dealt. Let me tell honorable members there is no protectionist country in the world that dare be absolutely true to its so-called principles, and Australia happily benefits immensely by these failures. France, Germany, and Belgium admit our pastoral products free of- duty. It is a remarkable fact, considering what we hear, that in 1899, 1 think, France, Germany, and Belgium bought of Australa'sia - I am including New Zealand in these figures - ?9,000,000 worth of goods, and only sold to Australasia ?3,000,000 worth. That was done in .spite of the open markets of New South Wales. It does not appear as if our open markets lead to any extraordinary flooding. Here we have the fact that these great countries of Europe, having millions of sheep themselves, ignore their pastoral interests and admit wool free of duty. The States of Australia are indebted mainly to these European countries for the way in which they have ignored the protective policy which is supposed to rule their finances. </para>

That acts as a deterrent to the importation of wool. Every one knows that while the Cleveland Government were in power Australia benefited materially, in the shape of the increased value of its wool, by reason of the purchases made by America. If America would do as Germany and France has done - ignore its pastoral industry, and allow wool to come in free - it would be a benefit to all Australia. </para>

              <para>- These are produced in various quarters of the Empire, and the aggregate production is so great that we have to rely on the great consuming countries of Europe to' take a certain surplus. Germany, whilst selling to us ?3,000,000 worth of - goods, has actually taken from us ?9,000,000 worth, but 'she has done something more than that. Honorable members know that London is the great market for wool, and Germany, France, and Belgium take from the London market ?8,000,000 worth of wool. I do not know how much of that wool is Australian ; but I presume that the bulk of it is, so that, in addition to taking the ?9,000,000 worth of goods direct from Australia, she takes a great many million pounds worth of wool from the London market. These facts will explain to the House why it is absolutely impossible, when it comes to be carefully considered, if such a point ever arises, to form a Zollverein of the British Empire, that is, a Zollverein in which there shall be free-trade within and protection without. I might also point out the effect of the system now ruling in Canada. Notwithstanding the fact that there is a certain advantage given on certain duties in Canada to British manufactures, in 1899 the average duty collected on British goods was 19'S per cent., and on American goods only 12-6 per cent. Of course, the imports from America were mostly raw materials ; but then a country exports that which she has to sell, and American exports to Canada were only charged 12'6 per cent, average duty, whereas the imports of British goods arriving in Canada, notwithstanding the alleged concession, were charged 19 '8 per cent. duty. The question of the Tariff is one of such overwhelming importance that I think it is our duty to urge the Government, nay to insist upon the Government, making known the time at which it will be introduced, and introducing it at a very early period. </para>

              <para>- I would point out, finally, that the one section in the Constitution. Act which is worded in a most emphatic manner is that relating to trade between the States. The words of that section are that trade between the States shall be "absolutely free." There is nowhere within the corners of that Constitution, so far as I know, any other section that is worded in that distinct and strong manner. .We free-traders feel that we have gained a great advantage for Australia in obtaining InterState free-trade, and our great aim is to obtain similar freedom with the rest of the world. </para>

They do not, however, contain a provision for a conference, which is most important. They contain a valuable provision that, supposing senators make a suggestion, the House of Representatives may accept it with amendments.

              <para>- There are 1,500 or 1,600 whites, and something like 3,000 Chinamen, so that they are not nearly all Chinamen. That does not, however, detract from my argument. The Chinese were let into the Northern Territory when they were being allowed to come in all over Australia. Directly Australia spoke out upon the matter we spoke out too, and stopped the influx of Chinese. By doing that we have suffered this loss. If we had allowed them to come in, the result would have been that, instead of tens of thousands, we should have hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of Chinamen there. We should have been able to tax all of them, and from the revenue so derived to pay the whole expenditure connected with it. That is not all. Determined as we are to keep the Northern Territory white, we have done another thing. We have absolutely refused to sell it.

              <para>- I think we have as low as 5 'inches in some parts, but as high as 12 inches, which you cannot reach. However, we will not argue that at all. As far as South Australia is concerned, we are only too willing to bear our 'share of the loss which this railway will cause, because we will get a profit which the other States will not enjoy, as it goes through our territory. For some 600 miles it is an absolutely waterless country ; there are no bridges or culverts to be built. It will be the most easily constructed line under the Commonwealth with this one exception, that there will be no water. There is no water, and the trouble of getting any will make the cost the same as that of the transcontinental railway - that is ?5,500,000. There is one thing I ask the Government to consider very seriously in connexion with what has been suggested by Western Australia. They propose to carry the line down to Eucla, which is close to the coast, and then take it back into1 the country. </para>

Anything which you add to the length of a line, which is to be built to insure the quick passage of mails and passengers, is a disadvantage. You have no port at Eucla ; you have no country of any kind there, but it is very well provided with means of communication from the sea. The people there do not want a railway. They cannot grow anything to supply the line except cattle, which, of course, they will drove, and not train. To take this detour, and go right down to Eucla- </para>

I am arguing the question of taking over the whole of the railways ; I am not arguing the question of taking over some of the railways. I believe it may be advisable for the Commonwealth in the future to take over a line of railway, such as the line from Brisbane to Sydney, the line from Sydney to Melbourne, the line from Melbourne to Adelaide, and the line from Adelaide to Perth, to work these lines as Commonwealth main lines, but certainly not to take over the railways as a whole.

              <para>- Undoubtedly, we ought to be economical. There is one point on which I distinctly disapprove of an expenditure which has been or is about to be incurred. The Commonwealth Act says that the number of Ministers of State shall be seven, and that their remuneration shall be ?12,000 a year. I am informed that the Ministry intend, not only to have that Ministerial allowance of ?12,000, but the allowance of ?400 a year each as members of Parliament. I am informed that the Prime Minister is to receive out of that ?12,000 ?2,100, and to get ?400 as a Member of Parliament, practically a salary of ?2,500, and that the other Ministers are to get with the parliamentary allowance of ?400 a salary of ?2,000 each, leaving them a little sum to divide among the whips and so forth. Whatever we do we ought, to pay a sufficient and liberal salary, but it should be done fairly and above board, and should not include fees or remuneration of any kind. The people of the community will, when they see that the Prime Minister receives ?2,100 as salary, forget in a very short time that he is receiving another sum of ?400, or in all a salary of ?2,500. Precisely the same thing will occur with the other Ministers. I am not saying whether it is too much or whether it is too little, because in the Commonwealth Bill, which I had a hand in framing, we proposed that Ministers should divide among them ?15,000 a year, and that Members of Parliament should be paid ?500 a year. That ?15,000 a year was reduced by the Convention of 1897, when I was in London, to ?12,000, and the parliamentary allowance was reduced to ?400. I entirely disapprove of Ministers dipping their hands at all in the direction I have indicated. I know that in South Australia, where we have payment of members, Ministers do nothing of the sort. </para>

              <para>- I am very glad to bear it. I did not say that I believed it, but I gave the Ministry the opportunity contradicting it in as public a manner a possible. Whatever we do in this respect we should/ do fairly, and certainly Tasmania cannot expect us to pay, except to a very small extent, for railway passes over her railways. The same thing applies to Western Australia, and South Australia could not expect so large a sum in proportion as Victoria, nor could Queensland expect so large a sum in proportion as Western Australia. </para>

              <para>- That is another point. I contend that Western Australian and Tasmanian members should get their steamer passages. It is only fair that they should be put in the same position as those from South Australia. We- have free railway passes, and do not have to pay for them out of our own pockets. Now, if we are to be economical, economy should start at home. I see in the Standing Orders that a Chairman of Committees and a Deputy President is to be appointed, and I say there is no necessity for such an appointment. You, sir, presided over the Legislative Council of South Australia for many years. You never had the assistance of a Chairman of Committees, and never required one. </para>

              <para>- I do not think so, except for the first session, perhaps. Our legislation may affect bigger interests, but it will not take a longer time. I am confident that, so far as this session is concerned,, when possibly there may be some excess of work, there are members of this House, who have had considerable experience m Parliament, who would be only too pleased, without any payment, to relieve the President whenever it might be deemed desirable or necessary. I am quite sure also that you would find that the work of the Senate would go on equally satisfactorily. </para>

              <para>- He can always get some one to relieve him. We should set an example to the States, and show that we are determined that the Commonwealth shall be established on lines of economy. You must recollect that we are taking from' the States a portion of their revenue, and if we want to make this Commonwealth unpopular, if we want to make it cursed throughout the length and breadth of Australia we have only got to be extravagant, and so extravagant that the amount of revenue received from the Customs which has to be returned to the States will be so small that they will be forced into direct taxation, the only form of taxation they have got. If there is fi form of taxation that falls most heavily upon the taxpayers it is direct taxation. You can take a lot of money out of the pockets of the people by Customs and Excise. They pay it in driblets, and do not know that they are paying it. But it isa different matter when you ask for so much income tax or so much land tax. Therefore I think it is not only right and proper that we should be economical without being parsimonious, but it is in our own interests that we should show the people whom we represent that we are 'determined to work this Commonwealth on as economical lines as possible, that we will not pay more cats than catch mice, and that we will in our own Chamber set an example by showing that we can make some small economy in connexion with the chairmanship of committees. </para>

            <para>- I do not know if in my remarks I can add anything useful to what has already been said, but it is only fair that I should accept the challenge thrown out by the courteous representative of the Government in this House, and, although I may be unable to enlighten the subject, throw some light upon the Senate by letting honorable members better know the character and faculties of those with whom in future they will have to deal. I must say that when I perused the address the impression it left upon my mind was that the party who framed it and the person .who phrased it were exceedingly frightened of those who were to read it. Its tone from first to last is one of compromise and conciliation. Whenever it was apparently suspected that the "matter touched upon would lead to controversy, the language was made timid and plausible as though to say - " I unfortunately may have to tread upon your corns, but I do not mean to do any harm to you, and I will make it up to you in other ways." It is only when the speech touches upon grounds where we are well known to be at one, that we find that vigorous and decisive language which, coming from a Government that says it is so strong, ought to be its dominant notes from first to last. It seems to me that, as the address purports to contain reasons for the summoning of Parliament, it should set forth certain well-defined notions upon a well-defined policy ; otherwise there are no reasons for summoning Parliament. </para>

              <para>- No, because, as I have explained, once the case has reached the High Court then the decision there given, if in accordance with those already given, ought to be final for rich or poor. If it is not in accordance with the decisions already given the variance in the judgments is not due to the fault of the Judge, but is inherent in the wise itself. By so doing I think you will bring about finality in the Court of Australia, and at the same time you will preserve the sentiment of Imperial superintendence, which is held to be desirable. If you are going to make this Australian Court a tribunal of last resort you must, in my opinion, give to it the authority, you must clothe it with the dignity, you must cast round it a halo worthy of the highest tribunal in this great and growing nation. You can only do so by taking steps to insure that your bench represents the highest judicial eminence, the fullest colonial experience, and that it possesses in the greatest possible degree the public confidence. </para>

              <para>- I hope we will have many philanthropists on it, and if my friend was as well acquainted with courts of law as I am, he would perceive that in most Judges the complaint lies less against their sense of righteousness, or of their carrying out what that sense prompts, than in their inability to come at all the facts of the case. No suggestion is well grounded which implies that a Judge on the bench is affected in his decision by anything other than his idea of justice. I respectfully suggest to the leader of the Government in this Senate a few considerations with the view of securing to this bench the character that I think it should possess. First of all, I consider there should be at least five Judges. </para>

              <para>- The number of appeals to the Privy Council is very much higher than the average stated, and the number of appeals to the High Court would be fifty times as great. It is not that litigants are content with judgments they obtain here, it is not that their litigious spirit is satisfied that they do not more often appeal, it is because they cannot contemplate the prospect of waiting two years and throwing away a thousand pounds to get a judgment from the Privy Council. I think the number of appeals would multiply enormously in the case of the High Court. </para>

              <para>- I think you should have five judges. It is desirable to have an odd number for many reasons. Seven would be too many, and three would be too few. We have to bear in mind that the High Court will have a good deal of chamber work, that it will have other tilings to do besides hearing appeals. Then a Judge may be sick, a Judge may be absent, and this is not a tribunal in which, in case of the absence or inability through sickness of any judge to attend, his place can be supplied by an acting justice. That would at once lower the dignity of such a tribunal. I have ascertained that in Canada, which has only a population of about 5,000,000 - very little larger than our own - they have a Chief Justice and five puisne Judges, and we have no reason to doubt that the Australian people will be less desirous of bringing their quarrels to the arbitrament of a court of justice than the people of Canada. </para>

              <para>- I am altogether disinterested in making this suggestion - I do not hope to obtain a seat on the bench yet. In Ireland we have a population of nearly the same number as Australia, and we have seventeen or eighteen Supreme Court Judges. The lowest salary received is ?3,500, and the highest, the Lord Chancellor's, ?6,000. The salaries paid in Australia have always, in my humble opinion, been disgracefully low. We should have the bench in every State, and in every part of the world, composed of men who are the flower of the bar. You would not like to submit your case to a court where the person arguing the case to the bench was an abler and more experienced lawyer than the person before whom he went through the anomalous farce of bowing and scraping and acknowledging superiority. It is an anomaly to have a third or fourth rate practitioner making more at the practice of his profession than the Judge on the bench receives. That exists all over the States. </para>

              <para>- I maintain that you have free-trade so long as you do nothing to interfere with the freedom of trade, that is so long as you do nothing to limit or affect the quantity or quality of imports. I can readily conceive a Tariff, a very substantial revenue Tariff, that will answer that definition. If you impose duties on commodities that you must use but cannot produce locally then you do . not lessen by ?1 the exchange through the port, whilst at the same time you provide a means of revenue. </para>

              <para>- You do in the theoretical sense that people may use coffee or whisky instead of tea. I am not a very deep student of the subject, but I have tried as far as I could to form an intelligent opinion upon it. Let us not quarrel about words which may have a different connotation according to the view of the speaker ; let us talk about things themselves. What I approve of is a Tariff that aims at paying into the Treasury box every penny that comes out of the consumer's pocket. As long as you secure that what is paid by the consumer goes into the Treasury chest you have a revenue or, as I call, it, a free-trade Tariff. </para>

Because the two Houses had no High Court to settle their quarrels and to mark the demarcation between their authorities. If the Constitution of any of the States was to be interpreted by a High Court such as our own will be, then we would never find this extraordinary departure by a body from its privileges which is indicated by the curious compact that apparently was entered into between the two Houses in South Australia. </para>

              <para>- It has a very great deal to do with the Constitution. There are some differences. We in this Senate are representatives of the States ; we have a mandate from them uncontrolled by any other House. We come here not to eat humble pie or bend the knee . in any way to the House of Representatives. We are here in no way connected with the House of Representatives. We are a body of co-ordinate jurisdiction, representing States, and within the limits of the mandate from our States we have every particle as much power as they have in the House of Representatives. I think that we more nearly approximate in our position - I will look the matter up before I speak again- - to the powers that were held by the Roman Senate than to any other body to which we can be compared. That Senate was the most powerful that ever existed. </para>

              <para>- It is that party from among whom I heard an honorable senator say we were not going half fast enough ; that there was a tremendous lot of social legislation that we wanted to get through. That is the progressive party which would cover the ground so fast that it would not regard the scenery on either side. I think a Constitution should not be too rigid like that of the United States, nor too flexible like that of Switzerland. Ours, in my opinion, hits the happy medium ; it is sufficiently elastic to bend to the will of the people, and sufficiently rigid, if we keep it as it is, only to bend slowly. I will conclude by saying that this Constitution is at all events entitled to a fair and, I would add, to a lengthy and deliberate trial. That much, apart from all other considerations, is due to the industry and ability of those who framed it. After all, it is only the legal and written expression of a federation which gained practically our unanimous approval - a federation which, though full of complexities and adjustments, is in its essence simplicity itself. Our federation has been moulded by no external pressure ; it has been suggested by no common danger ; it has arisen from no diplomatic relations, from no national complications ; it has sprung spontaneously from the internal affections of the people themselves. That consideration alone should moderate all our proceedings. It should beget in us a spirit of toleration, and should teach us not to approach this Constitution with a carping and critical mind that might lead to its disintegration, but to extend our gaze to the vastness of the subject, and taking it in broadly and comprehensively - this mingled yarn of good and ill together - honestly ' strive to realize by it the high purposes of its authors. </para>

              <para>- I do not want particularly to save them. I do not think there is anything more for me to say except to make a short reference to the InterState Commission. No doubt -that is one of the most important matters the Government has to deal with, and the success of the commission will depend entirely upon the ability and integrity of the men chosen. A high order of talent is necessary for any man who wishes to perform the duties of a commissioner. The commissioners should be possessed of expert knowledge and administrative ability in regard to the best railway traffic management in Australia. It should have the knowledge of business men, and I believe that many members will agree that it would not be complete without the legal knowledge of a sound lawyer. No doubt it would be a proper tiling that the chairman should be a judge or barrister. I hope that the Government will see that the four large States mostly interested in railway and river competition are represented on the commission. If. that is done it will be more likely to give satisfaction to the country as a whole. I was going to say a few words on the matter of defence, but so many military men have dealt with the subject that I need not refer to it now. I will therefore conclude my remarks. </para>

              <para>-Well, whatever may have been the motive of it, let me say that I intend to support the Government so long as they bring in measures that are for the welfare of Australia as a whole, and that I am not going at this juncture to be led aside by a trick or subterfuge in respect to any support I am likely to give them. So long as they stand by the programme that they have submitted to this House ; so long as they show their earnestness with regard to those questions, there is no doubt they will have the support of honorable members ; but the moment they turn aside from the policy they have enunciated, the moment they show any vacillation or weakness, at that moment should terminate their career as a Government.

I suppose the land in question is not more than 2 acres in extent. It is bounded by Swanston-street, Elizabeth-street, Collins-street, and Little Collins-street. Fifty-seven years ago the sum obtained for the rental value of that land was only ?160 per annum. To-day, by the enormous rise in land values, there is obtained from it ?266,550 per annum. </para>

              <para>- That shows, at all events, that the people who get such princely incomes from our land should bear a share in our national taxation. With regard to the question of a white Australia, I am afraid honorable members must be getting tired of it. I will have no paltering so far as any vote that I can give upon the question is concerned. We are told that the time is inopportune ; that vested interests are at stake ; and it seems to me that while there are those in this Senate, as well as outside, who are prepared to assent to the principle of a white Australia, yet when they come to deal with the question they are not very strong upon it. When we consider the necessity of keeping this country for men of our own race and blood, when we remember the great issues that are at stake, and when we recall to mind the teachings of history, we ought to be very careful to see that we leave no loophole for inferior races throughout Australia. As far as I am concerned, and as far as it is legitimate within the four corners of our Constitution, I will do all that I can to keep them out. Upon this matter I have received, during the last few days, a statement from the pearl divers who are engaged in the pearl shelling industry in the northern part of Australia. After all, the kanaka trouble is only a very small portion of the whole matter, when we come to consider the alien question as it affects Australia. In our own State of Victoria, the census of ten years ago showed that there was something like 80,000 aliens, and when the one which has just been taken comes to be made up, we will find that we have had a very large increase. Coming back to one phase of this subject, I have a statement from the pearl shelters of the northern part of Australia. One of them writes :- </para>

            <para>The white men of great wealth who employ coloured aliens for pearl shelling found that the coloured men saved their earnings and bought boats of their own. The moneyed man found the coloured men, under those conditions, too strong a competitor for him, and had a law made, so far as Queensland shelling grounds go, that no coloured man was to work on his own account or own a boat. This law was made in December of 1898, and assented to by the Queen in 1899. </para>

            <para>Surely, if this was just and right, the white divers may claim the same right. If the moneyed man is to be protected, justice demands the working man to be protected. I pray that you will take up these pearl shell fisheries, for, unless we working men combine, we may be quite trodden under foot. The white pearl-sheller capitalist - in Queensland, at all events - wants to employ coloured men, but be protected against them working for themselves. It is time we had a share of this protection. Coloured labour should be abolished altogether from these fisheries after, say, seven years from now. The white sailors, sailmakers, and shipwrights have all been kept out of pearling industries. </para>

            <para>We European divers (that is users of the European diving dress) ask you respectfully to intercede on our behalf with the Parliament of Australia to grant us protection against the inroad of coloured Asiatic alien divers who are in the employ of European masters, diving in the waters of the northern coast of Australia, from Cooktown, Queensland, round to nearly Geraldton on the coast of Western Australia. These men sire employed to bring up pearl shell from the waters just referred to, and we are of course powerless to compete against them, worked as they are by very rich men. If the coloured divers were working on their own account we would feel then that in this industry, which at present scarcely gives any employment to white men at all, we might still compete ; but a European diver, with limited capital, working for himself with one boat has no chance whatever against the great number of coloured divers who are worked by moneyed men who can have relays of these men in their boats and tire us completely out. As it is, in this industry we think at least 350 divers using diving dresses, and all the implements of our trade, must be employed. They raise material worth very nearly a quarter of a million every .year. If any other trade than ours had to contend against such unfair competition we feel sure it would be removed ; but this is a long way distant, and so escapes attention. As to providing European divers, this is easily done; a man who likes the work learns it in three months without being taught at all. Asiatics have acquired this art, so can Europeans as they have done; but while European masters are allowed to employ aliens and unthinking subservient Malays we have no chance, and have already had to leave the field. We remember when there were many European divers working in this industry - they have been driven out - they cannot live iii the poor way the coloured men do working for their European masters. We respectfully pray that you will take up the cause of the European divers. </para>

              <para>- In one sense it has nothing to do with the Federal Government, and yet in another way it has, because the time will soon come when, if we desire to see the law, as we have it in some of the States, applied to the whole of Australia, the Federal Government must take up the question. I advocate that there should be a uniform factory law throughout Australia. There may be a difference of opinion with regard to this subject, but honorable members can see at once that if the law is not uniform throughout Australia the result must be that those persons who are in a better position must be brought down to the level of those who are in an inferior position. Therefore, I trust, as this question affects the great majority of the workers of Australia, the Government will remember that and legislate in the way I have suggested. </para>

              <para>- -I want to say a few words on the question of conciliation and compulsory arbitration. This, I think, will loom largely in the near future. It is one of those questions which, in other parts of the world, have engaged the attention of various Governments. I sincerely trust that, as we have been promised a Bill on this subject, the Government will at a very early date bring in a measure that will afford us scope for legislative action in this direction. Ten years ago the question of conciliation and compulsory arbitration was considered to be outside the realm of practical politics. There is no necessity this evening for me to enlarge on the disastrous strikes and locks-out that have occurred in various parts of Australia. We have had evidence in this State, as well as in the various States of the union, and we shall be compelled, sooner or later, to legislate in this particular direction. I sincerely trust that in any measure which the Government may bring forward, compulsory clauses will be inserted. I say emphatically, after giving a little study to this question, unless an Act of that description contains compulsory clauses, it will be worse than useless. We have had the successful experience of New Zealand on this all-important question. </para>

              <para>- Not with respect to conciliation, because that is the weak point in the New Zealand Act. The experience of New Zealand .has shown that it would have been far better if that portion of the Act had been eliminated, and that from the first, any demand that was made by organized bodies of workmen should have gone at once to the court of arbitration. If it goes at once to the court of arbitration you will have finality, and you will not have the time frittered away, as we find occurs under the New Zealand Act in the stages with respect to the conciliation proposals. Perhaps it is not known to some senators that we have on the statute-book of Victoria an Act dealing with this question. The absence of compulsory clauses makes the Act completely a dead letter, because you can only set the law in motion, when both parties to a dispute are prepared to bring it before a Court. If one party stands aloof and will not have arbitration then you have no finality in an industrial quarrel. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Bill to give relief to those that may be engaged in industrial struggles will contain compulsory clauses, that at any rate will give finality and settlement in these disastrous matters. I do not know that I have very much more to say. I hope that we shall adopt a business spirit in the Senate, and approach the various questions that will be submitted in such a way that the result 'will be that, at any rate so far as the Commonwealth Parliament is concerned, the great questions that demand a settlement will be settled in such a way as shall bring progress and peace to the people of this continent. </para>

If we were to reduce our stations - and we could do it except in the suburbs - we should save ?103,000 per annum, but we prefer to, pay that and give the accommodation to our producers and others. In the speech delivered by the Prime Minister at Maitland a good deal was said in reference to a uniform railway gauge. I fail to discover any reference to that question in the Governor-General's speech, although it is a matter of far more importance than either the railway required . by the Western Australians or that beloved by the South Australian representatives. It must come, and I would ask the representative of the Government to note this - not because I am any wiser than any other honorable member, except that I have had twenty years of railway experience- </para>

              <para>- I am afraid that commission would be composed of the wrong stamp of men. It is quite likely that the permanent heads of the Railway departments would be better able to judge. We are continually building rolling-stock in all the States. That rolling-stock, I have no hesitation in saying, could be devised in such a way that it could be altered to suit a uniform gauge.

In the event of war we should draft our recruits from the mercantile marine into our navy, and that is one reason why the subsidy should only be given to boats that are manned by our own countrymen. Here is a whole line of large steamers - the P. and O. Company's line - receiving from the Commonwealth ?36,000 ; or ?85,000 in all, the balance being paid by the Imperial Government. </para>

              <para>- I would rather give the companies which employ white men a much larger subsidy. Supposing Great Britain were entangled in a big war with one or two naval powers, a number of these vessels would be armed as fast cruisers. Then you would have to take these darkies out. If they were already manned with white men, that would be unnecessary. In 1896 there was a conference representing Australasia, which met and passed a certain resolution. This Postal and Telegraph Conference was composed of the political heads of the Postal departments of the seven colonies, with their respective deputies, so that the subject was well considered, no doubt. It met in Sydney on the 20th January, 1896, and passed the following resolution : - </para>

            <para>This conference, having considered the reply of the London office to the stipulation of the Hobart conference with regard to the manning of the mail boats by white instead of coloured labour, recognises fully the force of the reason given by the Imperial Government against insisting on the exclusion of coloured labour, viz. , the necessity of discriminating; between various classes of British subjects ; but in reply would respectfully point out that by some steam-ship companies the labour of the contributing colonies is excluded from employment, and an invidious preference given to the labour of countries which do not contribute to the maintenance of the service. No injustice would thus be done by the stipulation that the labour of the countries subsidizing the service only should be employed. And, therefore, this conference is of opinion that the mails to and from Australia and Groat Britain should be carried by ships manned with white crews only. </para>
