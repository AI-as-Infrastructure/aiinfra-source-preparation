                    <para>. - The amendment may involve a very large sum to the Commonwealth, although it may not involve very much to the individuals whose properties are concerned. I would draw the attention of honorable senators to what the provision really means, and in what way this interest becomes payable when the land is secured under clause 6. It becomes at once the property of the Commonwealth, and within 120 days of that time a claim must be made by the person claiming, and after a certain period therefrom the matter, if there is a dispute about it, goes into court and the compensation is settled. Clause 18 provides that where compensation is awarded the amount shall be paid to the party entitled thereto or to his agent duly authorized in that behalf, provided that the person must satisfy the Attorney-General that he has a title before receiving payment. The net result of the procedure is that when a man's land is taken he is entitled to make his claim as soon as possible. The sooner he makes his claim the sooner the processes are set in motion which result in the matter being brought before the court, and within a month after the question of compensation has been determined by the court the Government are bound to pay. As there may be some delay in paying, subclause (2) of this clause provides - </para>

                        <para>- I was just coming to that point. In similar enactments in some of the States a much larger amount of interest than the current rate is provided foi*. For instance, under the New South "Wales Act 6 per cent, interest runs during the whole of this time. Of course considering the ordinary price of money no man could have a better investment than 6 per cent, interest until the compensation money was paid over, and therefore there was always an inducement to keep the thing hanging over to make delays in regard to the preparation of evidence of title and in other ways. What we want to avoid is the holding out of an inducement to any delays of that kind. On the other hand, we must look at the matter from the point of view of the claimant. We may take it that he has sold his property to a person who can give him the best of all security - a gilt edged security. The rate of interest varies according to the value of the security. With a poor security one requires a larger interest; with a better security one can take a smaller interest. The best security one can possibly have is the security of the Government, and the only question is whether under all the circumstances it is not a fair thing to have the rate of interest placed at 3 per cent, during the time which will elapse from the taking of the land until the compensation is settled. That rate has been fixed because it is about what the Government debentures will bring net. </para>

                        <para>- With the price above par that does not give very much beyond 3 per cent. That is a fair test of what we ought to give, and I do not think we ought to give any more. . We ought to give as much as we give to the public creditor on bonds whatever it may amount to. AVe fixed the rate at 3 per cent., because we think- that is a very fair allowance. Besides that, we must remember that we are fixing this rate for a very long period. In the other States, when the rate of 6 per cent, was fixed, no doubt that was a fair market interest to allow at that time. </para>

                        <para>- The current mortgage rate changes from time to time. If the honorable and learned senator will look back for a number of years he will find that it was very much higher some years ago than it is now. We have no safety unless we stand to what the fair interest is on Government bonds. I think on that principle we ought to settle the rate. The interest which is charged on mortgages depends on a great many circumstances, as, for instance, the land of security, the kind of property, and the credit of the man himself. </para>

                    (Tasmania).^ My first impression when I read the clause was not the sort of impression which
                    has, but an impression that the Commonwealth was going to be unnecessarily lenient. The Minister has pointed out that the acquisition of the land by the Commonwealth from a private individual dates from the notification in the
                    In the case of an ordinary contract for sale - and this notification in the
                    may be put on exactly the same footing as the signing of an agreement for sale - no interest would be allowed immediately upon the signing of the agreement. In all ordinary practice at least one month would be allowed in which to complete the title and to tender the conveyance signed. The Commonwealth will offer the rate of 3 per cent, from the date of the notification in the
                    and it seems to me that in every case, practically, interest would be paid by the Commonwealth, although in any ordinary case of private contract no interest would be paid for at least a month after the signing of the agreement for sale.

                    <para>- I draw no distinction with regard to the rate of interest or the date from which it should begin between a sale under the* Bill and an ordinary contract sale between- two persons. Seeing that interest is bound to be paid to every person whose land is acquired for a certain time, I think the clause is very lenient in that it does not state that 3 per cent, would be paid at the expiration of one month after the acquisition of the land. The time probably will be short during which interest will have to be paid. If any person wants to obtain interest on money for a short period of three months he will find it extremely difficult in the Commonwealth .to get 3 per cent, anywhere. Of course he will not get 3 per cent, from any banks, where I believe the current rate is 3 per cent, for twelve months. It is not 3 per cent, for three months or six months. In comparison with the rate of interest offered by any of our institutions, 3 per cent, for a short period by the Commonwealth is very generous. For these reasons I think the provision is very generous to the public. </para>

                        <para>- Treasury Bills return 35/8 to the investor. There is another instance on this list where the percentage to the investor is less than 3¼ per cent., and in one case, where the loan is only for a short-dated period, the yield is 4 per cent. If honorable senators take the trouble to go through the quotations issued from time to time during the last two or three years, they will find that the percentage returned to the investor has been higher than 3 per cent., which is the rate given by the Government under this Bill. Let us look ahead. What are the probabilities ? Is there not a great probability that money will yield a higher rate, so far as Government debentures are concerned, than it does at the present time ? At any rate, it is not likely to fall below what it is at the present time. Why, then, should we seek to say to the man whose land we take from him voluntarily or involuntarily, that he shall receive Jess than he would get if he had invested in Government debentures ? </para>

                        <para>- I am taking the yield to the investor. For instance, there are two cases of 4 per cent, loans that have been issued by New South Wales. The prices at which they are sold to-day will realize 3½ per cent, to the investor on the amount given. There is one 4 per cent, stock selling at 106 buyer, latest sales at 106½. On the debenture stock the yield to the investor is 3½ per cent. Taking the Sydney quotations, it will be found that in no case do the Government debentures return less than 3½ per cent. on the amount paid by the buyer on his investment. I am sure these figures must convince honorable senators that we are making the interest rather too low, unless we can show that there will probably be a very great fall in the price of money in the future. If we take the trouble to consider the condition of affairs at the present time, and look to future probabilities, I think we shall find that it is likely that the interest on money, so far from falling below what it is now, will actually become higher. When we consider the engagements Great Britain has entered into - and Great Britain, after all, regulates the price of our money - the loans she will have to raise, and is raising, we may rest assured that, instead of interest becoming lower, it will probably become higher. I am only speaking of Government stock, which is the very best security you can get. If honorable senators consider the question of loaning money on mortgage, they will find that no man will lend a comparatively small sum at a less rate than 3 per cent. Small loans will realise 5, 5-J-, and 6 per cent., even on good suburban security around our cities. </para>

                        <para>- Of course. If it is for a long period, you can get interest at a lower rate than if you take the money for a short period ; in this particular case the interest is only to be paid for a short period. I say that you should take that into consideration in fixing the amount of interest to be paid. </para>

                        <para>- Why should a man be compelled to lend to the Government for three months? If I could find an investment where I could lend my money for three years, I should take it, but if not I should prefer to put it into Government stock ; and if I put it into the lowest priced Government stock on the market I could get 3 J per cent, at the present time. I think the Government might concede this small sum to the public. It would be a very reasonable concession, and it would not be difficult for the Government to find the additional amount of money required. </para>

                        <para>- It might be; but are we going to pass a Bill under which large areas of land will be resumed after five or six years have gone by ? The large resumptions will be in the early days of the Commonwealth, at a time when money is likely to be higher than it is now, and not a long way in the future, when, by some possibility, money may become cheaper in the market than it is to-day.. It has been said that if this becomes an important matter, Parliament can- alter the Act ; but my opinion is that unless we are asking for more than what is reasonable in the interests of the public and the Commonwealth, the Government may justly give way, to the extent of paying such a rate of interest as would be received by a man from investments in Government stock. It is only in the interests of fair play between the parties that I support the amendment. . I think if the honorable and learned senator in charge of the Bill had large sums to put out on mortgage, and found that he could only get 3 per cent., he would not loan his money in that way, but would secure investments that would give him up to 5 per cent., and that would be as safe as Government stock itself is. I therefore hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will see his way to increase the amount of interest, for, after all, we are only desirous of doing what is a fair thing between parties and the Common wealth. </para>

They both have drawn attention to the fact that sales under this Act are compulsory sales, and, therefore, some additional compensation ought to be given to the persons whose land is resumed. I wish to say that that sort of solace for wounded feelings is already provided for by the addition of the 10 per cent, margin.

                    (New South Wales). - Some question has been raised with regard to the date from which this, payment should take place, and the effect of it. The clause provides that a man is entitled to interest from the date of the acquisition of the land until the payment. Honorable senators will find that the date of the acquisition of the land is the time the notification appears in the
                    The notification appears in the
                    to-day, for instance, and it has the effect of vesting the whole property in the Government of the Commonwealth at once. The property may be one which has been improved. There may be tenants upon it, and a rental may be received in respect of it, possibly to the extent of 5, 6, 8, or 10 per cent, on the amount that is to be paid for it. The Government will be the persons entitled to receive those rents, and from the date of acquisition they will receive them. At a very moderate computation these rentals may be put down at 6 per cent., so that the Government will begetting 6 per cent, upon money for which they are only paying 3 per cent, to the person who is legally entitled to it. The case of the Rocks resumption, alluded to by
                    is a case in point. There lands were resumed more than eighteen months ago, and the Crown to-day is receiving, and has been receiving from the start, the whole of the rents, and has not attempted to pay interest or any remuneration to any individual concerned, unless he is prepared to go cap in hand and say that he is a beggar or a pauper, and cannot live without his rents or interest. Such a case may happen in connexion with these resumptions. There may be difficulties and technicalities in the way of an immediate settlement, brought about by no fault of the owner of the land, but through, perhaps, some fault in the nature of his title, which the Government will desire to have investigated and cleared up to ascertain who really is entitled to the money. The owner may be in this position.  His  land is resumed, the rents from it are being received by the Government, and he is told that at some future date he will receive 3 per cent., or about half, possibly, what the Government will have been receiving by way of rents from his property. A case like that would be a manifest hardship. It appears to me that the Government are not doing anything so wonderfully generous because the very moment the notice appears in the
                    the property is vested in the Government, and the owner is a trespasser if he goes on to it. Surely it is fair that he should be considered under circumstances like that. Now as to the debentures. If I ask a broker to buy debentures for me he will take them out of the Treasury, and I do not pay him a commission, because the Crown pays him. That, at any rate, is the practice in New South Wales. He gets £ per cent., I believe, from the Crown while the stock goes into the hands of the purchaser at the price paid by him.

                        <para>- I am pointing out that if I did buy them first-hand it would cost me nothing for commission, because the Crown pays the commission, and I would get a bigger return than I otherwise would. If a commission had to be paid in buying stock that might interfere with the rate of interest for one year ; .but if I am buying the stock for the purpose of an investment to be distributed over a number of years, the amount paid for commission would be infinitesimal. When we want to realize on stock we- have a marketable commodity as good as banknotes, because it will have its fixed price in the market, regulated by supply and demand, and that price can be got at any moment. The price may go down to a lower rate, and then one would lose, but on the other hand it might go up to a higher rate and then one would gain by it. </para>

We must remember that the owner of the land is the lender in this case. He cannot operate with the money he lends, and he must accept the rate of interest provided by the Bill. If an honorable senator goes to any one and says - "I want to borrow a certain sum. of money for three months as a matter of ordinary business," he will find that he will not get the amount at 3 per cent. He will have to pay much more than that for so short a period. </para>

                        <para>- .The Government have already paid him full value, and he has no right to claim interest on a sum, which it is alleged, they have taken from him. I do not see any need to pay any interest, except that the money might be kept in hand for an interminable period. The proposition that we are acquiring from a person, 100 sovereigns, and must pay him the current rate of interest, is not the correct one, because we have already taken into consideration that we are taking from* him the earning power of the money, and compensated him for that. For that reason I trust the Government will not give way. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - There is a very simple answer to the argument of the last speaker. The interest is not at all in the nature of compensation for the land taken. No matter whether 1 or 10 or 20 per cent, is added to the price of that land, the money is given for the land. The Bill provides that the value of the land shall be that which it had on the preceding 1st January. That may be a certain figure arrived at by the court, with 10 per cent, added, or whatever the Judge may think fit to add. On the ' 2nd January, or a month after, the man should be in a position to walk away with his money. Seeing that we cannot give him the money within that time, the question is what rate shall we pay him for the use of it. The 10 per cent, has absolutely nothing to do with that question. The ordinary private vendor would be able to take his money and go into some other business. Take the' case of a small farmer with a farm which is possibly only worth £500, but which, by the aid of his labour, gives him an income of £150. What position are we placing that man in if we resume his land and keep him for twelve months without his money, and give him such a paltry interest as 3 per cent. ? He is not able to go into any business. If he had to float a loan on his prospect of his obtaining payment from the Government to buy another farm, he would certainly have to pay much more than 3 per cent. Until he can get his money he is under considerable difficulty, because he can do nothing. Although he is the possessor of the farm until he is paid by the Government, lie is completely placed in hobbles. He certainly could go into the labour market, but if he had disposed of his farm privately he could have bought another farm and gone to work. The question is, what interest shall we pay for the forcible . use of his money during the time it is' retained
                    That is a matter entirely distinct from the question of what percentage, if any, is to be added to the value of the land.

                    (South Australia). - These cunning arguments almost go beyond me. But, even taking the case of this farmer, how would it be if a man who was making £150 out of a farm worth £500 -with the aid of his labour had been negotiating to sell that farm to
                    ? The negotiations might . go on for three months, and in anticipation of something happening he might do nothing. Even at the end of the period
                    might draw back and not buy the farm, and the man would lose all that time. Suppose; on the other hand, that
                    did complete the purchase of the farm and gave the money, it would be a considerable time before the farmer could put the £500 into anything where he could begin to exercise his labour with any chance ok success. But in the case of the Government, as soon as ever the notification is gazetted, the" sale is complete, because they take the land with all the improvements ; and the man knows that the only difficulty which stands in the way of a settlement is as to an agreement about the price. Then, with respect to the value, every consideration is given to the seller. An honorable senator has said that it is very unfair for the Government to agree to give a certain amount to a man for his land, and forcibly take it, and then only give him 3 per cent, interest on theamount.
                    put the thing very fairly in the case of sovereigns. But supposing it was a piece of improved land, and that the holder was getting 6 per cent, on the purchase money of that land. Does not every one know that whenever negotiations are entered into with respect to its value, the value of the improvements and everything else are taken into consideration ; and, instead of getting what he might have paid, say £500, he would very likely get £750 or £1,000 ; so that, instead of getting interest on £500 at 6 per cent., he would get 3 per cent, on £1,000. I contend that with all the provisions to compensate the individual for the loss of the land, his improvements, his goodwill, his sovereigns, and everything else, he is entitled to no interest at all. The only argument in favour of paying any .interest is that it will make the Government hurry up, and come to a settlement as soon as possible. The Government are treating the individual very generously in giving 3 per cent, from the time of the notice.

                    <para>- It appears to me that the matter of interest is one of degree. The Bill provides for the actual compulsory purchasing of . the land, and we ought to go on in a logical way and provide a fair interest. Those who will be chiefly concerned will be small capitalists. The big holder will not suffer. It is the small man I want to protect. We are putting him practically in a position of a forced sale against his will, and he has not had an opportunity to look round and invest his money in a concern in which he has been used to utilize his labour. We are turning him adrift for the time being, and we ought to -give him a fair and reasonable interest, and not treat him as if he had the money, and simply wanted to get something for it in the meantime. That is the crux of the question, and that is- the fairest way of looking at it. I hope that honorable senators will give that view of the case their fair consideration. The burden will be placed not on the big man, but on the small man. </para>

                        <para>- We are willing to pay him interest. There is plenty of discussion on what we are going to do, but if we follow the thing out logically that may be. That brings me really to the point I wish to submit. It is impossible to adjust these things to a nicety. When we take a man's land it may be that nothing can compensate him. But we have to do the best we can, in order to make what is commonly called a fair deal between him and the Government. Under ordinary circumstances, supposing this land were to be sold or acquired in a voluntary manner, the vendor has to make out his title, and until he does so he is not entitled to a farthing of purchase money, or anything for the time he has spent while he has been endeavouring to sell. </para>

                    <para>- Of course he does ; but that has nothing to do with what I am pointing out now. He has no right whatever to a farthing of money until he has satisfied the purchaser that he has a good title, and the conveyance is handed over. We put him in a different position here. Whatever his title may be, we say from the very date of notification, which we treat as a conveyance from the Government, " You shall have 3 per cent. interest, no matter how long it takes you to investigate the title" ; so that if that work takes eight, ten, or twelve months, instead of the owner being at that loss, the Government are at the loss. </para>

                        <para>- Of course they do if there are any rents and profits, but in the great bulk of the cases there are no rents and profits. What rents and profits are there out of a corner of land we snip off for a public building somewhere ? What rents and profits are there in a variety of cases where we take a suburban allotment for a post-office? In the great bulk of cases there are no rents and profits, but where there are, of course the Government take them over. We are dealing with these cases generally. We have to make a law which applies to the generality of cases. We cannot deal with individual cases. We have to do the best we can in laying down a general principle which will apply most fairly to all cases. The way in which we can deal mast fairly with all cases is this ; that although we give what may not under certain circumstances be a very high rate of interest, on the other hand we give a very great advantage in paying that interest while the owner is making out his title. If it takes him a long time to do it that is. his own fault, but he may make it out directly the compensation is ascertained. There is another view of it. The question of what is to be paid is not settled until after the agreement has been arrived at or the action has been tried, but we pay him interest dating back long before that has been ascertained. </para>

                    <para>- Let it be a matter of mutual agreement between the two parties. As this is n case of forcible resumption, is it not a fair thing that the State authorities should have a voice in regard to the method of payment as well as the Government resuming ? This is not a matter in which any great difference is likely to occur, but it seems to be rather an arbitrary arrangement that the federal authorities carrying out the compulsory resumption should also be the sole arbitrators in regard to the method of payment. </para>

                        <para>- We should have to give the value equivalent to the compensation whatever it might be. First of all, the basis on which the payment for compensation was to be made to the State would have to be determined. Then the payments to the State would have to be ' to that . value, in accordance with the provisions of this clause. Surely it would be a good transaction for the State to receive Commonwealth stock at its face value, because I take it that the Commonwealth stock would always bc higher in the market than its face value. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, that might affect the face value ; but, after all, the clause gives the State the right to get the cash at the end of the period. The State does not lose the money. Suppose it is a short-dated stock, which gives an investment for ten years. At the end of that time the persons who have taken I the debentures go to the Commonwealth Government and get cash for them. It is only a question of investment. The difficulty is to devise any machinery by which you can adequately provide for these matters, and I think that here, as in a good many other things, you. must leave it to the sense of fairness of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                    <para>- This is a matter that may to some extent affect the States, and, therefore, it should be debated in the Senate. The clause gives the Commonwealth, at the option of the Governor-General, that is to say, not at the option of the States, the right to pay for these lands in cash or in Commonwealth debentures at their face value. I think I am right in saying that that means par value. It is conceivable, that the Commonwealth may issue debentures at a discount, that is to say, debentures to the amount of £100 may be issued at £96 or £98. This clause provides that the States in accepting payment shall accept those debentures as being of the value of £100. </para>

                        <para>- I am going to point out that we have nothing to do with that. Instead of giving £500 cash, we give £500 in debentures. What does that mean ? Apart from the question of the market price, it means that in five, ten, twenty, or thirty years, whatever the term may be, the person to whom the debenture is given is entitled to take it to the Commonwealth and get cash for it, and in the meantime he gets 3 per cent, interest. So that, apart altogether from the question of the market value of the stock, we simply defer the payment of the compensation until the due date of the debenture, and in the meantime give interest at the rate of 3 per cent. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - For the very reason suggested by the Vice-President of the Executive Council in urging that the federal authorities should be left a large measure of liberty in this matter, - 1 suggest the elimination of the word " face." It may happen that at the time the federal authorities wish to pay compensation in bonds they may be issuing them at £95. As a matter of common honesty, I am sure they would refrain from attempting the payment of a State with depreciated currency, but if we eliminated this word "face," they could pay the compensation by giving a larger number of bonds than they would have to give if the bonds were issued at par.

On the other hand, supposing the Commonwealth bonds are at a premium, the Commonwealth should be in a position to. pa.y with the premium-quoted bond, but it could not be done under this Bill as it stands. The only way in which we could part with bonds under the second sub-clause would be when the bonds were actually at par. </para>

                        <para>- Of course it would give the Commonwealth Government more power, and I am sure no federal authority would attempt to pay with depreciated paper. If the bonds were at a discount, the federal authority would not pay with them, and on the other hand, assuming that they were at a premium, they would not attempt to pay with them because they could sell them in the open market and pay cash to the State. I submit to the Vice-President that it would be better to leave out the word "face," and then the federal authorities could make their own arrangements with the States when compensation had to be paid. </para>

                        <para>- I point out to the. Vice-President of the Executive Council that the real trouble in connexion with these two sub-clauses arises from the us of the words "at the option of the Governor-General." 'Hie option is not given to the State that is to receive the compensation, but to the Common wealth that is to pay it. This is really the greatest difficulty of this clause,, and I am not certain that if we left out the word " face " we would be acting in a fair way to the States. I cannot see why the option should be with the GovernorGeneral of the Commonwealth and not with, the States. The States would of course prefer to have -cash in compensation, and I cannot see any reason why we should force upon them against their will any other mode of payment. .! do not think that the option could be exercised by the States adversely to the Commonwealth if we altered the clause by giving the option to the State, and at the same time altered paragraph (&amp;). I think the clause might be wisely postponed, and though if amended in the way the honorable senator has suggested, it would largely meet the difficulties I have urged, a better amendment would probably be made if there were a postponement of the clause for its further consideration. </para>

Governor-General, and not with the States, for the reason that under paragraph (c) no State would object to hand over a portion of its debt, because that .would be an exchange of a less valuable fora more valuable asset. The amendment I have suggested would meet the whole difficulty, because the "market value" would be the value of the stock on the Stock Exchange. </para>

It provides only that the Federal Government may make payment by relieving the State of its liability for principal and interest in respect to an equivalent amount of any public debt that is already taken over. But supposing that a resumption took place to-day, not having token over any public debt, we could not pay in that way. The object of my amendment would be to enable the Government to operate by relieving the State of its liability in respect of any debt which we have taken over or may take over as a part of that operation. It is assumed in sub-clause (c) that we have taken over some part of the public debt.

                        <para>- We are not bound to take it. It is at the option of the Governor-General, and if it is not there we cannot take it. Supposing that a resumption took place to-morrow, and that it was desired by the Commonwealth to make payment by taking over a portion of the public debt, there is no provision by which it could be done. Sub-clause (c) can only be brought into operation after a portion of the public debt has been taken over. I would suggest that we insert after the word " may " in the sub-clause the words " or may not previously." </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out now why it is that the option should not be given to the State. We are dealing now with a matter which is of vital importance and concern to the finances of the Commonwealth in its early years. So long as we see that each State is fairly dealt with and fairly protected we must leave it to the Commonwealth to say in what way this payment shall be made. It may be convenient in some cases to pay cash ; but it may be impossible to pay cash except by going into the money markets of the world and perhaps raising money under disadvantageous circumstances. The Commonwealth ought not to be put. in that position. It ought to be in a position to arrange the whole of its financial policy in the most reasonable and advantageous way it can: Probably one of the most important matters of financial concern during the very early period of its existence will be to find out what it owes the different States in regards to all these properties. It may then have to raise a loan for the purpose of meeting the expenditure, and to pay by debentures, or by cash, as may best suit the circumstances of the Commonwealth. Because, after all, although we have to see that each State is fairly dealt with, at the same time we must remember that the people of Australia have given us the power to make laws for bringing the Constitution into operation, and for arranging for the payment of this compensation. We are bound to make those laws, with due regard not only to what is fair to the States, but what is possible, reasonable, and prudent as to the business of the Commonwealth. We cannot do that unless we make the Commonwealth the master of the situation in regard to the method of payment. Take care that they must be fair; take care that they must give value for what they take ; but as to the method, leave an option to the Commonwealth as to how it is to be done. </para>

                    <para>- At first sight there would appear to be a great deal of force in the arguments of Senators Clemons and Dobson - that by the Commonwealth taking this option, it might place some of the States in an awkward position. A State might be in want of cash, and might have land which otherwise it would sell for cash ; but under this provision the Commonwealth would be entitled to pay in debentures. It is true that the State might take these debentures into the market and sell at the market price, but there is this difficulty - that if a large number were thrown on the market suddenly, it would affect not only the value of those handed over to the State, but the value of those held by everyone else. It is just as well that we should try and think out what class of State assets are likely to be taken over. None of these are assets which the States could sell for cash, and therefore there is no harm on that score.The States certainly would not sell the post-offices, the public buildings, or the telegraphs. A State could not, therefore, be injured by having debentures handed to it in place of bricks and mortar. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- Every honorable senator will agree with me that it is just as undesirable, as it is impossible to resist the fair appeal made by
                    am prepared to accept in subclause (b) the alteration which he has offered - the substitution of the word " market " for the word " face." He asks us to recognise the position of the Commonwealth in this matter, and points out how desirable it is that it should be enabled by this Bill to pay the States by debentures and not by cash. We must consider how that will affect the States. The States have, in many cases, borrowed money at a higher rate than the Commonwealth certainly will pay. The option now being allowed will put some States in the position of having borrowed money, say at 4 per cent., and lending it by taking up debentures at3½ or 3 per cent. Although I am willing to accept the amendment I wish to point out, in fairness to my side of the question, that under the clause the Commonwealth will be able to put more than one State in that curious financial position. It will leave them borrowers of money at 4 per cent. and lenders at 3½ or 3 per cent. I am sure the Minister will recognise that there is some sound reasoning in my plea. I put it to him that, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, he can now with every graciousness consent to put in the words market value. I cannot see that acting on behalf of my own State or any other State I can urge anything further.

This opens up the whole question as to whether or not public lands, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, shall be sold or leased. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed but that it is probable that there will be a special Act dealing with the lands within the federal territory, I think it is desirable to mention this matter with a view, if necessary, to amending the clause, or at any rate with a view to directing the attention of the committee to the fact that by this clause we are asked to approve of the principle of the sale of Commonwealth land. I am strongly in favour of the retention by the Commonwealth of land passing into its possession, . but I am not prepared to redraft the whole of clause 50 now. </para>

                    <para>- Probably it has not occurred to some honorable senators who are not in favour of the sale of Government lands, that there are a number of pieces of land belonging to the post-office which are utterly useless for post-office purposes, and which the department would be only too glad to get quit of. The department could not possibly lease them, and the only possibility is to sell them. The Education department in Victoria is in the same position. There are pieces of land which have been reserved for post-office purposes but which are not wanted. It is better to get rid of them. I am entirely in favour of the leasing system with regard to the lands of the federal capital, but we should not tie the hands of the Federal Government by compelling them to retain idle and vacant pieces of land. Surely they should have power to dispose of them. </para>

                        <para>- I believe there is a large portion of land held on building leases, although some of it may have passed to the original holder. However, there is no use arguing the question in that way. If there is a small piece of land in any town or township that can be leased either as a building site or for any other purpose, it should be leased in preference to being offered for sale. If an individual bought it he would want to make some use of it, and if it was worth buying, it would be worth leasing. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there is any land that has no value for leasing purposes that would be of any value for sale. There may be a few feet of land adjacent to some person's property, and it might be of value to the individual to acquire that land. He might be prepared to buy it, and it might be of very little value to any one else ; but if so, it would be of just as much value to him to lease it, if he got it on fair terms, and he would probably get good terms from the Federal Government for the purpose of utilizing that land. In addition to that, the clause gives power to the Government to " otherwise dispose of" such land. The argument may be used that of course if the Government acquires land for the purpose of a post-office or for any other purpose in any part of the Commonwealth, and finds it is not suitable, they would have to get another site, and would consequently like to sell the land first bought. Would not the words "and dispose of " such land give the Government an opportunity of exchanging it? Or if it were found to be beneficial to the community it might be given to a corporate body for public purposes. But to say that the Government is to acquire land for any purpose whatever and then afterwards have the power to sell it, after what has transpired in days gone by with respect to State operations in that line of business, is an idea that I must oppose. </para>

We are dealing with an immense amount of land which we did not buy, but which we are forced to take over in connexion with the transferred services. In every one of the States we are bound to take over, and there is vested in us under the Constitution Act, the land upon which the business of the transferred services has been carried on. Does the honorable senator mean to say that for all time, no matter whether the land may become absolutely useless to the Commonwealth or not, the Government must go on holding more land than is necessary for its operations, simply because in the first days of its history it became possessed of the property ? </para>

                        <para>- If, as a matter of ordinary business, it would be useless and wasteful for the Government to hold certain land, why should they hold it ? It would be quite a different thing if we were starting upon a career of acquiring only such lands as we thought were necessary for Commonwealth purposes. It might be a very sound policy when taking land for public purposes in that way to provide that it should not be disposed of except by leasing.But when we are dealing with land which has been handed over, and upon which the transferred services are carried on, why should we be bound to confine our operations to the particular land where they have been carried on, and why, when other land has been acquired in other places for carrying on the same services, should we still keep the useless land in our hands? It may be said that the Government can lease that land. We all know, however, that, except in certain localities, the leasing of certain portions of land is an illusory thing so far as values are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I am making an exception. In crowded localities, in a city, perhaps, there are certain building sites which may be leased under advantageous circumstances. There might also be some sites immediately in the vicinity of a city where the Government might do the same thing. But as a general rule, where you can dispose of one piece of land advantageously in that way, there are hundreds of cases where you cannot do so. I object to have the hands of the Commonwealth tied in regard to lands which we do not want. I hope that in the future we shall be able to effect many savings in the carrying on of the transferred services. Those savings may result from moving public offices of different kinds from one place to another.If that takes place, why should we be compelled to hold on to land for which we have no further use? The principle of the non-alienation of the public estate is an admirable one. It is a principle which ought to be and will be carried out in its entirety with regard to land which the Commonwealth purchases. But it would be a mistake to carry it out in cases where, as under this Bill, we have an immense amount of property placed upon our hands, a great deal of which may become useless. It is not right in the early days of the Commonwealth to tie the hands of the Government by compelling it to hold on to that laud under conditions which may probably involve in many cases a dead loss, instead of enabling the Government to carry on the business as an ordinary individual would, and when they have no further use for land to sell it and confine their operations to laud which is necessary. Let me put one illustration, which, I think, will make the matter clear. Take the case of fortifications. There is a large area of land in all the States which is occupied for purposes of fortifications, and which has come over to the Commonwealth with the Defence departments of the States. These lands may not always be wanted. The needs of the Commonwealth with regard to fortifications may change. New guns and armaments, and fresh military inventions of other kinds, may compel the Government to leave the sites of the present fortifications and other places where similar operations are carried on. Why should we keep on our hands land which was useful enough at one time, but which is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was acquired? Where this principle can be carried out with benefit to the Commonwealth, it will be carried out; that is, in connexion with the federal territory. But it would be riding the principle to death to attempt to carry it out by forcing us to keep land upon our hands which it may be in the best interests of the Commonwealth to get rid of, in order to enable us the better to carry on our business. </para>

                        <para>- They may have to do so in connexion with the building of the federal capital. Then take the case of an old Customs-house on a wharf which is not in a good situation, or the case of an old post-office in a township. The piece of land on which the old Customs-house or the old post-office stands may become useless in consequence of the erection of new buildings elsewhere. Probably some person would be willing to buy the whole place for the sake of the material on which it is built, .sud may find it profitable to erect a new building on the land. But if we are to hamper the purchaser by giving him only a 99 years'' lease, he may not be disposed to take it. Where you can get a dozen purchasers you might not be able to get a single lessee. This amendment would compel the Commonwealth Government to hold land which it does not want, and which it would sooner turn into sovereigns and pay into the Treasury. I shall oppose the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I am one of those who are of opinion that it is not in the public interest, either of the Commonwealth or the States, to alienate any public lands. We have been told by honorable senators that it is inadvisable to alienate any public land within the area secured for the federal capital.. If that is correct, surely we can logically apply the same rule to land owned by the Commonwealth throughout the States, lt has been said that the Commonwealth will have certain strip's of land which will have no value whatever, but which it could sell at a high price. That is a contradiction in terms. What constitutes the value of- land is its re weneuearni ng capacity. </para>

                        <para>- It may be tin odd corner, but if it is useful to somebody, that is what constitutes its value. If the Government can sell that land for £1,000, the reason will be that the land is wanted for occupation, and has some revenue - earning capacity. Why cannot the Government be the landlord of that ground as well as any private individual? If a private individual buys land, and makes a profit out of it, why cannot the Government make a profit out of it? The Government should make a greater profit out of it, for the simple reason that the Government can borrow money for the purpose of securing the land at a lower rate than any private individual. An illustration lias been given, of land used for fortifications. It has been suggested that if the fortifications are removed the land is useless to the Commonwealth for Government purposes. It may be useless for the purposes of erecting public works or buildings, but I still maintain that the land is just as valuable to the Commonwealth as it can be to any private individual. If it is useful for anything, say for mining, the Commonwealth can extract the minerals from it or work it just as well as any private individual. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is a very great mistake that the States have alienated any land at all. They ought to be the ground landlords of the whole territory; but land has been alienated, and the Commonwealth should not continue the practice. I cannot understand honorable senators saying that it is absolutely advisable that not a single inch of the land acquired for the federal capital should be alienated, when they will not apply the same principle to land held by the Commonwealth throughout the States. It is quite wrong to say that there are certain properties that would be of no use to the Commonwealth, because they must be of the same value at least to the Commonwealth as they are to any private individual. </para>

                <para>SenatorDRAKE. - It comes to very much the same thing. The honorable senator says that, supposing there is land now in possession of the Commonwealth which is not required, we should lease it, and play- the part of landlord in the States. That would be very undesirable. I think, on the contrary, that it is a very good principle that the Commonwealth should not acquire any more land in the States than we actually require ' to carry on our operations. That is the correct principle.' There is a very clear distinction between the ownership of land by the Commonwealth in the States, and the acquisition of land by the Commonwealth for the purposes chiefly of the federal capital, because, where the federal capital is there will be the Federal Government to administer it. All the land there will be the property of the Federal Government, and will occupy the same position with regard to the Federal Government as unalienated land in the different States occupies with regard to the States' Governments. The Commonwealth Government should restrict itself in the States, simply to the occupation of the pieces of land actually required to carry on its operations. Look what an absurdity the honorable senator's suggestion would lead to. Fortifications have been mentioned. Supposing there is a piece of land on which a fort has been erected on the bank of a river, and it afterwards becomes necessary to shift the fort to the other side of the river, which may be a more commanding position, is the Commonwealth for all time to retain the ownership of that piece of land which it has ceased to want ? The same thing applies with regard to the post-office. Our post-office business is carried on in little bits of shops in the streets of some towns. We have, perhaps, a quarter of an acre of land with a shop on it, in which the business of the post-office is carried on. By-and-by it will become desirable to erect a larger post-office, and that will render the place at present occupied entirely unnecessary. Is the Commonwealth of Australia for all time to stick to that little bit of land no matter what it may be worth ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but the honorable senator does not see my point. It is not the business of the Commonwealth to be dealing in land. The only justification for ' the Commonwealth owning land within a State at all is that it is necessary to carry on the work of the Commonwealth Government, and as soon as that necessity ceases to exist, the land should go back to the State or to individuals. If there is any question between individual ownership and State ownership, the difficulty can be got over by the State acquiring the land from the Commonwealth. This is not a question to my mind as between private and State ownership of land, but as to whether land in a State should be in the possession of the Commonwealth Government or not, and I say again that it is entirely undesirable that the Commonwealth should retain any more land in the State than is absolutely necessary to carry on the business of the Government. </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General has expressed pretty nearly what I intended to say. We want to preserve the Constitution, and many of us want to preserve the rights of the States at the same time.' There are some, however, who would like to trespass upon them more or less, by seeking under the Constitution - which they think may give them the opportunity - to interfere; with rights which are purely local, and with which we, as a Commonwealth, were never intended to have anything to do. The Postmaster-General said truly, that it is Commonwealth territory in connexion with which it is at our absolute discretion to say whether we will indulge in the fads of some honorable senators by not selling land. That is a matter which may be discussed hereafter. 1 am not going to discuss it at the present moment, or to say whether T agree with it or not, though at present my inclination is not to agree with it. The Postmaster-General has no right to acquire any land from a State except that which is necessary for his business. If he asks more than is necessary - he is invading the rights of the States in taking it; but it is necessary in carrying on his business to take some land, and he must go no further than is required. If he finds he has taken land which is not necessary for his purpose, what is he to do with it? Is he to be the holder of a number of little bits of territory in the States, held under laws different to those of the States ? It might be land that could be sold when he took it, and why should he hold it on different terms? This is quite apart from the question as to whether it would be more beneficial to sell or lease. I leave out of consideration absolutely the pounds, shillings, and pence question as to what he is going to earn in the management of the thing. Are we, who assert the </para>

The matter is absolutely insignificant in detail, but it may be important in principle. We are the protectors of the States quite as much us of the Commonwealth, and we should not seek to bring pressure to bear on the States in the matter of legislation which is peculiarly within their jurisdiction. I will be no party to the Commonwealth being used for any such purpose. That is not what I came here for. I came for the purpose of protecting the Commonwealth to the bitter end, and for the purpose of protecting my State to precisely the same degree. I say that the only chance of order and good government throughout is by understanding the principles of the Constitution and insisting upon every right the Commonwealth has got, and not by making it a means of bringing pressure to bear on the States on account of our particular fads in respect of matters which are within their jurisdiction, and not subjects for us to decide at all. I entirely agree with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Therefore the land would have a value as leasehold land, and could be disposed of. It would only be in exceptional cases where we would not be able to lease. Take the case of a large area not sui bible for building purposes, which has been reserved for the purpose of fortifications. If it is not close to a settled part and has no value as building land or farming land, if it cannot be leased for either purpose what will be its . selling value? It will be practically nothing. Therefore, the Commonwealth would not benefit if it had power to sell that land ; it would practically have to give it away. Really, if the land has not a leasing value, the only drawback is that it has to remain in the hands of the Government. There is another method of disposing of land, and that is the method of exchange. The land which has no leasing value may . possibly be exchanged with a State Government for land which may be useful for Commonwealth services. The principle we aim at is that of retaining the land in the hands of the whole people, and an exchange to the State Government would accomplish that ' object as well as leasing to private persons. If the Government cannot see their way to accept the amendment, I think we ought; to have a. provision that in case of a sale it shall be sold to the State Government and not to a private individual. </para>

                        <para>- I think this is the time to take exception to such a proposal. I did not know until I saw the amendment that the Minister intended to- raise the question before we reached clause 19. I call attention to it now so that we may at ones decide whether the Postmaster-General - or if he likes to put it, the Cabinet - shall have the -absolute power to decide what the postal rates shall be, and to commit the whole of the Commonwealth to those rates. It may be said that in clause 19 provision is made for the Order in Council to be laid before both Chambers, and that unless either House takes exception to it, it then becomes law. We know perfectly well what happens when Orders in Council and regulations are laid upon the table of a House. They are hardly ever seen, and it does appear to me to be most unwise to trust to some honorable member of either House, having the good luck to come across these regulations, and then to move that the House do not agree with them. What happens in such a case ? The safeguards that necessarily follow the introduction of a Bill are absent. If any honorable senator, takes exception to a regulation, it simply means that each honorable senator can only speak once. I feel that I am justified in calling the very serious attention of the Senate to what, to me, is an innovation on what has been the established practice . in dealing with postal matters. Do not let us leave it in the hands of any Minister to pass regulations changing the whole of our postal arrangements, trusting to honorable senators dropping across those regulations when laid on the table of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- This matter was fully discussed at an earlier stage in the Bill. It was considered on the second reading, and it was also fully discussed on clause 19. That clause, as amended, seems to meet with the approbation of the Senate. I have had clause 2 re-drafted in the belief that the Senate is still of the same opinion as when we adopted clause 19. I am quite willing, however, to accept a discussion and to test the matter on this clause. The practice in regard to the fixing of rates has been different in the several States. It is quite true that in Victoria it is necessary to have an Act of Parliament to alter a postal rate. Hence the necessity . ' recently for the passing of an Act in Victoria reducing the postal rate from twopence to one penny. In New South Wales the rates can be altered by an Order in Council. In Queensland an Act of Parliament is required. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the committee to reconsider its decision, substituting the word " shall " for the word " may " in the first line. The clause now provides that the proprietor, printer, or publisher of any newspaper shall in such time and such form become registered. The reasons which were given for the change appeared to be good and sound, but when we consider that we have not power to insist on a newspaper being registered unless it wants to use the Post office, it will be seen that it is absolutely necessary to restore the word "may," otherwise we shall be exercising a right which we have no claim to do.

It was originally fixed at 24 hours, but it was altered to twelve hours. Twelve hours would be sufficient in a great many cases, but it would hardly be sufficient in the case of vessels clearing for foreign ports, and seeing that there is no special time mentioned for this notice to be given, it is clear that the provision could be complied with by the vessel giving a notice at 7 o'clock in the evening to go at 7 o'clock next morning. The notice might be running through the night, and it would be impossible for the postal authorities to arrange to put their mail bags on board. Under these circumstances I move - . . </para>

                    <para>- I understand that this provision deals with coasting vessels. Supposing that a coasting vessel were putting into port for provisions . and going on again, it would necessitate a detention of probably ten hours, when a stay of a couple of hours would be sufficient, in order to comply with this rather drastic provision. I do not like the provision at all, but I would suggest to the Minister that if he desires to retain it he should leave the six hours' notice as it is, as being perhaps a fair compromise between the convenience of his department and the convenience of the ship-owner. </para>

                        was the provision which caused a great deal of trouble to the committee. It was asked with a great deal of force what right the Postmaster-General had to give a licence to any private person to cross a road by a wire. It is perfectly clear to me that the department has a right to run a wire along a street, and if we can do that we interfere with private persons. I therefore think it would be better to omit the proviso and insert a new one ; so that instead of saying that we confer a right upon any person to cross a road, we say that nothing in this Act shall prevent them. I move -

                        <para>- Yes ; we simply receive the fee for waiving the right which we think we have to prevent such a person from carrying his line across the road. If we had one of our own lines running along the roadway we could certainly interfere and regulate the manner in which a privately owned wire should be carried across ours. All that we say in this case is that we believe - if we like to exercise our powers -that we could interfere and prevent a man from running his line across a road, but that we will not do so. We receive a small fee for waiving that right. </para>

That must be distinctly understood. The Postmaster-General would have a perfect right to prevent the owner of such a line from carrying it across a road, or even from erecting a telegraph line, except on his own property, under our own special law, which gives the monopoly to the postal department. We cannot give a right to a private individual to carry a line across a road, although we can take the right ourselves. Private individuals who are going to construct these telegraph lines must therefore remember that there are other authorities whose- consent they must obtain, before they exercise the privilege given them under this clause. </para>

                    <para>- Before the honorable senator moves his amendment, there is another matter to which I should like to refer. I am not at all satisfied with the statement made by the Postmaster-General as to the meaning of the second sub-clause in paragraph («). Power is given to the Governor-General to make regulations, prescribing the fees, rates, and dues to be received for any conversation on any telephone line, or in any telephone exchange, or any private telephone line. The word "any " practically means all. It may be the intention of the Postal authorities to limit this provision to lines, such as those mentioned by the Postmaster-General ; but with considerable knowledge of the extent to which regulations are worked in my own State, I should fear to seethe sub-clause passed in that form. If the Postmaster-General only desires to have the power to charge in the cases he has referred to, I would suggest to him that he should make that intention a little clearer, otherwise ' some one may discover in the sub-clause a justification for attempting to make charges in regard to other lines. </para>

I think we should leave all purely administrative matters to the Postmaster-General, who is the responsible Minister. </para>

                    <para>- When the Bill was under discussion before, I pointed out that under this clause power was taken . by the Postmaster-General to inflict fines for neglect of duty or irregularity in the conduct of business. I pointed out also that the Public Service Bill was then before another place, and that in that Bill full power was taken to deal with all the officers of the public service. All the officers of the post-office are officers of the public service, and in , the Public Service Bill any breach of discipline is to be dealt with by the commissioner. I therefore felt that it was not necessary for the Postmaster-General under this clause to take to himself the power to inflict punishment, because it would be overriding the Public Service Bill, and practically providing two sets of punishments for the same class of officers. Since then we have had- the Public Service Bill brought up to the Senate, and under clause 46 of that Bill, there is full provision made for fines to be imposed, not by the political head of the department, but by the permanent head of the department, as has been the case, I believe, in many of the States. In other clauses there is provision made that where an officer is guilty of any wilful disobedience or disregard of lawful orders, negligence and carelessness, and so on, the permanent head of the department may reprimand him or suspend him for a time ; and it is, moreover, at his discretion to inflict a fine not exceeding £5, though, as at first introduced in another place, the Bill permitted a fine of £10. The Public Service Bill, as we now have it, places it within the power of the permanent head of the department to maintain the discipline of the department where necessary by the infliction of a fine up to £5 for various offences, and if anything more serious occurs it is reported to the Minister, who may authorize the matter to be sent on for consideration by the Public Service Commissioner. There are full provisions made for carrying out the powers given in the Public Service Bill. It seems to me undesirable, having this Bill before us, which will no doubt become law, that we should at the same time introduce into this Post and Telegraph Bill a special clause dealing specially with the officers of one department. Even if we pass this clause and the Public Service Bill is passed subsequently to it, I venture to say that the Public Service Bill will prevail. The last Act passed will certainly prevail. It therefore appears ' to me that the proper course for the Senate to take is to strike out clause 92 altogether, and leave the officers of the Post-office department to be dealt with under the Public Service Bill. </para>

                <para>Service Bill it is worthy of consideration whether the power of fining should rest with the Minister or with the Deputy Postmaster-General in each of the States. From one point of view, I think it is desirable that the power should rest with the Postmaster-General, because we should then get something like uniformity ; whereas, if we put the fining into the hands of the Deputy Postmasters-General, the way in which it will be exercised will depend to a very great extent upon the view which a particular man takes. One man may be inclined to be very severe, and another to be very lenient. </para>

                        <para>- The provision of the Public Service Bill gives the power of fining to the Deputy Postmasters-General. In the Victorian Postal Act previous to federation there was, I think, the peculiar anomaly that the Postmaster-General could' not inflict a fine, but he could remit one. The power, I think, is at present in Victoria in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General, and the Minister can remit a fine as soon as the deputy inflicts it. Under the Public Service Bill the Postmaster-General, the Ministerial head of the department, is out of it altogether, and has no power either to fine or to remit a fine. It is generally admitted that there must be some means of punishing men for small offences without going to the extreme length of dismissing or reducing them, and if there is to be such a power it is for the committee to decide whether it shall rest with the Ministerial head or with the permanent head of the department. </para>

                    (South Australia). It would be better to leave to the Deputy Postmaster-General power to inflict a fine up to £5. If it is necessary that something more than that should be done - that an officer should be dismissed or should be prosecuted, the power should be vested in the Postmaster-General. This clause does not provide for anything of that sort, but says that the Postmaster-General shall have power to fine. I think the Postmaster-General must see that in his own interests it would be better to leave that power with the Deputy Postmasters-General, who will be conversant in the various States with the irregularity or breach of discipline calling for a fine.

                    <para>- In practice it will ultimately be found that it -will be the Deputy Postmasters General who will levy the fine. Take, for instance, the case of . some small offence committed in Western- Australia, how is the Postmaster-General, located in Melbourne, to determine the fine in such a case? It would be done nominally by him under this clause, but to all intents and purposes it would practically be done by the Deputy Postmaster-General in Western Australia. On that ground I see no objection to leaving the clause, as the practice will be in uniformity with the provision in the Public Service Bill. </para>

                    S ARGOOD.This clause has been recommitted in consequence of my having called attention to the fact that there is no provision made for an appeal. It creates a number of crimes and misdemeanours, and, apparently, there is no provision for an appeal. The Minister promised to consider the point and say whether it was necessary to insert a special appeal clause. I am one of those who think that no man should be tried and sentenced without some right of appeal.

                    (New South Wales).This clause proceeds to take away a right which is given by a previous clause to owners of private wires. Clause 77 gives the right, without any authority, to a man to use telegraph lines. If it gives him an authority what is clause 124 wanted for? It is either intended to allow the owner of an existing line to continue to use it or the possessor of certain property to erect a line within that property and use it without any application to the Minister or it is not.

                        <para>- Clause 77 does not apply to the proviso at all, and clause 124 refers to persons who offend against what it is stated that persons shall not do under clause 77. It is not stated that they shall not maintain and use telegraph lines for private purposes. It is stared that they shall not use them for purposes other than the proviso sets forth, and clause 124 says that persons who do things which they are not authorized to do, shall be punished. I think it is quite unnecessary to have any amendment. Clause 124 begins with the words - "Any person who without the authority of the Postmaster-General sets up or maintains," that is, any person who is unauthorized, and the Postmaster-General can authorize under clause 77. </para>

                    (New South Wales).The authority in clause 77 is given by the Bill. It may be held that it is necessary to make application to the Minister, in spite of the authority given in clause 77, otherwise he would offend against clause . 124, because he would not be in possession of the authority which clause 77 says is necessary. It has to be noticed that clause 124 calls on parsons to pay such charges as the -Minister may levy. Clauses 77 and 77a clearly exempt a person from any liability of that kind

                    (Western Australia). - Reading clauses 77 and 77a, what is provided is that the Postmaster-General shall have the exclusive privilege of putting up any public telegraph line and transmitting messages thereon, provided always that it is not to apply to certain private lines which are referred to. Clause 77a says that he may, on such conditions as he deems fit, authorize any person to greet and maintain telegraph lines within the Commonwealth, that is that he can authorize them to erect and maintain telegraph lines which are outside the proviso which is specially made. Clause 124 then comes and exactly fits in with clause 77a. It says that if such lines as a person cannot erect by virtue of the proviso, and which he can only do by reason of the authorization of the Postmaster-General are erected he shall suffer a certain penalty. It seems to me that nothing could be logically clearer than the reading of the three clauses.

                    (New South Wales).If the clause really said what the last speaker has declared it does say, there could be no objection to it. But it does not. Clauses 77, 77a, and 78 provide that, while the Postmaster-General has the exclusive privilege of erecting telegraph lines, there are exemptions in favour of certain individuals. Clause 124 does not provide a penalty for those who erect telegraph lines contrary to clause 77, but goes on to say that persons to whom clause 77 has exempted shall apply to the Postmaster-General. That is ray point. I have no objection to a clause providing a penalty for those who erect and maintain telegraph lines illegitimately, but what I object to is that those who erect them under clause 77 shall have to apply to the Postmaster-General.

Clause
                    says that the Postmaster-General may, on such conditions as he deems proper, authorize persons to " use the same." What is meant by "the same" ? The things that cannot be erected under this Bill, under the exemption. Therefore you have to read clauses 77, 77a, and 124 with the proviso, which merely says that those who come within the proviso shall not erect telegraph lines at all within the meaning of this measure.

                    (Tasmania). - I think the Postmaster-General must have seen what is fairly obvious by this time, that clause 77 refers to land of which a man may be proprietor or occupier. The land of which he can be proprietor or occupier is also referred to distinctly in clause 124 in a contradictory manner when it deals with Crown lands. It is obvious to me that a man may be the occupier of Crown lands, and so far as the words " or on any Crown lands " are concerned, they seem to me to be contradictory of clause 77 in so much as a man . may be the occupier of Crown lands.

They say that under clause 77a they cannot undertake to do any repairing or maintaining without the authority of the Postmaster-General. I must confess that the clause reads like that. I am sure that is not what the Postmaster-General mean's. I hope he will make a note of the point.

                    KEATING (Tasmania).- When the Bill was previously in committee the Postmaster-General promised to give consideration to such cases as that of the Municipal Council of Launceston, who, under statutory powers conferred upon them by the Parliament of Tasmania, have erected a system of electric lighting for that city. I do not think that the honorable senator has gone far enough in his proposed amendment. What I propose for the consideration of the committee is that as an amendment upon the amendment that has been moved there be inserted after the words "injuriously affected thereby" the following words -
                </para>

                        <para>-I use the word "person" advisedly, because it would cover any body politic, such as a city corporation, under our Acts Interpretation Act I do not intend to necessarily restrict the operations of the amendment to any particular body, such as a municipal council, because in many instances inland towns have been lit - as is the case in New South Wales - by electrical authorities, the powers connected with which were originally vested in individual person's. But those persons have assigned, their rights to a company for the purpose of exercising those rights in the public interest. Therefore, I use the word "person" to cover the case of any body politic or any local authority. I do not see that the adoption of my amendment can defeat the object the Postmaster-General intends to give effect to by his own amendment. The amendment of the honorable gentleman only refers to cases where the original wires have been erected prior to the erection of the telegraph line. In the case I am more particularly acquainted with, the city from which I come - Launceston - the telegraph wires were erected years before; but the authority to convey electric power for lighting purposes was conferred upon the Corporation by statute, together with such restrictions as would prevent the exercise of the power proving prejudicial to the State, which was conducting the Telegraph department in the interests of the people. I think I can convince the Postmaster-General, by reference to the statute under which the Launceston Corporation exercises its powers, that the Postal department has been amply protected, and that in the discharge of its duties it would be in no way prejudicially affected. I think the honorable senator will find, if he takes the amendment as I have suggested it, that it would be better than making it a new sub-clause. </para>

I am told that they will affect the whole of the wires of the city of Melbourne, and as I have said before it would be monstrously unfair to penalize any body which had erected lines in accordance with the law.

                        <para>- I am only using the word as a layman. The question whether these wires are put up prior to or subsequent to the erection of lines by the Commonwealth should not affect the matter at all. The whole question is, whether they have been put up lawfully. If they have, the Postmaster-General must agree with me, that it would be exceedingly unfair to throw the cost on the parties. If the Postmaster-General does something which places his line in jeopardy he ought to pay for it. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the words " with the consent of," which appear in the amendment, are unnecessary. It would be quite sufficient to say " where such electric lines or works have been lawfully constructed prior to," and so on. Supposing that a line can be lawfully constructed with the consent of the Postmaster-General, and that that consent has been obtained, then the line is lawfully constructed. It seems to me that . if the Postmaster-General were to adopt the suggestion I have made he would cover the whole thing. </para>

                    Sargood has mentioned a case in this State, and I know of several in New South Wales where municipal councils have constructed electric lighting works.

As a matter of fact the electric lighting lines in Launceston were not constructed prior to the erection of the State wires. They were erected, however, under statutory power, which provided carefully " and fully - against any possible injury to the telegraph lines of the State of Tasmania. I cannot see why the Postmaster-General should insist upon the use of words which introduce a qualification that must inflict an indirect injustice, and a qualification for which, under no circumstances, can I see any justification. I would urge the honorable and learned senator to remove the two words I have referred to. They create a limitation, or they would not be there. If they do that the Postmaster-General must also admit that they may give rise to an injustice. As a matter of fact we who represent Tasmania assure the honorable and learned senator that they may do considerable injustice in that State if they are permitted to remain.

The State of Tasmania by direct legislation has given the Postmaster-General all' the protection he asks for, and if he consents to insert in the clause the word " lawfully," he will secure his department, while at the same time he will prevent our rights from being imperilled.

I do submit, with all respect, that if the honorable and learned senator inserts the word "lawfully" he makes ample provision for his own department. At the same time he will satisfy us. If we are both satisfied then what is the objection. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - If I am wrong in my interpretation of the amendment, I hope the Postmaster-General will tell me% The first 'thing is to get a clear understanding of what is intended. I should take it that the clause means this. Where certain electric wires are put up by persons other than the Postmaster-General in accordance .with the law, then if the Postmaster-General puts up public wires afterwards he shall compensate the persons who are injured by anything he has to do in the the erection of those public wires. But if the Postmaster-General puts up wires for the public convenience first, and then individuals who want to erect lines for their own private purposes come along, they shall not be paid compensation. If the Postmaster - General substitutes " lawfully " for the words contained in paragraphs
                    and
                    then I shall have no fault to find with the latter part of the clause. The latter part says that the Postmaster-General shall give compensation when wires have been put up prior to those owned by the department, in case the person who has put up those wires is put to loss without any warning on the part of the department. When the Postmaster-General erects his wires first the private individual who comes long afterwards will get no compensation, because he should have opened his eyes and seen that the public wires were already there. I would simply suggest to the Postmaster-General the substitution of the word "lawfully" for the words contained in paragraphs
                    and (6). Those words are exhaustive of what would be " lawful." I think it would be better to use the more general term. If the Minister considers that private lines can only be lawful when they are put up with the consent of the Postmaster-General or a Deputy Postmaster- General, or the Postmaster-General of a State before the transfer of a department, it is right to put those words in, but if there are other cases in which they might be lawfully erected then we should use the general term. Certainly the Postmaster-General will have no objection to using the more general term if really all that he means is contained
                    paragraphs
                    and
                    I am not with
                    in his objection to the use of the words "prior to." I do not see
                    reason why a person should get compensation when he comes along after public wires have been erected and puts up his own.

                    (Tasmania). - So foi: as substituting the word "lawfully" for the words "with the consent of," and also for the words contained in paragraphs
                    and
                    I am perfectly in accord with, those who have given expression to the necessity for such a course. At the same time I cannot agree with the Postmaster-General that there is strong necessity for the retention of the words "prior to." Some of the authorities in Launceston who have erected these electric wires for the purpose either of: conducting power or light have done so under direct statutory authority conferred on them. Some of these lines may have been erected ten or twelve years. They were erected in compliance with the stringent, provisions of statutes, imposing on their owners obligations which necessitated their safeguarding the interests of the Postal department. If they have carried out those provisions rigidly and strictly, and have had ten or twelve years' use of the wires,, then I say that they had an already existing vested right, when the department was transferred from the State to the Commonwealth, which the Postmaster-General should recognise. Take the instance to which I have already referred. The Postmaster-General has taken over the administration of the Telegraph departments of the several States, and amongst them the Telegraph department of the State of Tasmania. If the Telegraph department of that State has recognised that the erection of certain wires in the past have not -in any way prejudicially affected the wires under their control, surely the Postmaster-General should take over the property of the Telegraph department of Tasmania, subject to the conditions existing at present.

                        <para>- And as laid down in the statutes. It is precisely for that reason that I ask for the elimination of the words "prior to" from the amendment. At the present time certain persons in the State of Tasmania, have satisfied the authorities of the State, and have complied with the conditions laid down in the Act empowering them to erect certain wires. The same thing will apply in the case of persons in other States of the Commonwealth, and I think the Postmaster-General should take things over as they are, subject to' the existing liabilities, and carrying whatever advantages the department may have at the present time. Certainly the position in Tasmania is that these wires could not be shifted by the State department without recognising the vested rights already in existence, inasmuch as those who have erected the wires have absolutely complied with the conditions of the statute. It was hardly correct to say that the Postmaster-General or the Deputy Postmaster-General in the State of Tasmania had consented to the erection of these wires. I find that it is only in certain cases that it is necessary for this body to notify the department, within a certain period, of their intention to erect wires in any direction, and if the Postmaster-General thinks fit he can then take action. If he takes no action at all, can it be said that by his silence or inaction he has given the consent which is referred to here? I contend that these bodies, by virtue of the statutory provisions under which they have constructed their works, have acquired, and will continue to acquire as the years go on, vested rights which should not be interfered with, simply because of the transference of the different departments to the control of one person. I am prepared to suggest an amendment, leaving out the words - " With the consent of," and paragraphs (a) and (b), and inserting the word "lawfully " after the word " been," so that the amendment would read - " Where such electric lines or works have been lawfully constructed," and so on. </para>

When the matter was previously before the committee I quoted for honorable senators the practice adopted in Great Britain. In a case where the wires, of a corporation have been put up before the telegraph line, and the telegraph line is injuriously affected by those wires, it is a fair thing that we should pay the cost of shifting them.

                    (Tasmania).- This question is now in a serious position, because I can assure the Postmaster-General that if he insists upon these words " prior to " being inserted in- the clause, he will have to face a direct, collision between this Act of the Commonwealth and an enactment of the Parliament of Tasmania. I assure him that the Parliament of Tasmania has directly legislated in a manner that is opposed to this clause with regard to the rights of certain corporations to erect electric works and wires, and that those works were not erected prior to the erection of the telegraph lines which the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth has taken over. This clause, if amended, as now proposed, will be in direct antagonism to the Tasmanian legislation. I do not want to speak at any length now upon the constitutional aspects, and I ask the Postmaster-General to let us know what he proposes to do.

I see that as used here the words "prior to" will have a very much wider effect than I understood was to be the case. I understood that the reference was to any line constructed prior to telegraph lines erected by the Commonwealth, but not to lines taken over by the Commonwealth, which is a very different thing. If it is to affect all lines taken over by the Postmaster-General it seems to me to be an injustice.

                    (New South Wales). - I spoke just now in favour of the retention of the words "prior to," but looking back through the Bill it appears to me that they are quite unnecessary. The Postmaster-General maintains that lines which maybe erected now should be removed without any claim, for compensation where they interfere with telegraph lines, and if the honorable senator does maintain that, I am with him. I point out that they would not be lawfully constructed because they would be an offence against clause 136 of this Bill, which states that no electrical works shall be carried out whereby any telegraph line of the Postmaster-General is or may be injuriously affected. We have only to deal with the lines already constructed, and we have to legalize their construction. Clause 136 appears to me to give ample protection to the postal authorities in the case of any works which may be constructed from this time forward. That being the case, I am now inclined to agree to the suggestion that the words- " prior to " should be omitted.

                    -said in reference to lines being put up by private persons subsequently. They are not protected by clause 136, because, if they do happen injuriously to affect a public line, they are put up unlawfully. The Postmaster-General is taking over the public telegraph lines of all the States. It may have been that sul&gt; sequently to the erection of those public lines, certain persons may have put up private lines authorized by Act of Parliament. That is the case in Tasmania.

That is really the question. I think the . private right ought to subserve to the public convenience, and J cannot see that the great hardship would be done, which is apparently contemplated by Senators Clemons and Keating. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- According to the definition clause, telegraph line covers telephone line, and in most of the instances which have been referred to, and which are covered by this clause, it will be the telephone rather than the telegraph lines of the Minister, which are likely to be injuriously affected. As we all know many of these wires are carried along side by side through the streets ; numbers of them possibly may have been erected before the private wire was put up, and, perhaps, a far greater number of them may have been erected after the private wire was put up. We have that peculiar position to face. I think the amendment will save the rights of those who have acted under statutory authority, and it will also preserve the
                    not only of those particular persons, but of the several States with respect to those particular persons in connexion with the authorities which were vested in them. I ask that the Postmaster-General will recognise that in taking over the departments of the several States, he took them over exactly as they stood, not only in themselves, but with regard to the individuals of that community. I do not think that honorable senators should consider, simply because illustrations have been used here having reference to existing rights in Tasmania, that this amendment is proposed merely in the interests of those particular persons. There are also others who are interested in a provision of this character. The city of

                        <para>- The Commonwealth is dealing with what exists now, and with lines to be erected in the future. Supposing that you have the lines existing, or supposing that you have not the lines existing, and that after your lines are created the Commonwealth erects some line which is in conflict with it; it has to pay you, but if your line is erected subsequently to that line no State shall have authority to give you power to construct a line which is destructive of a Commonwealth line. I think the provision is entirely right. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - If the clause means what
                    Downer states,' I am entirely with him, but it must be borne in mind that the Postmaster General has already taken over a number of lines and that some of these private lines have been erected since those lines were put up. As I understood the clause it was to apply to all lines to be erected subsequently to the passing of the Bill, and if words are put in to that effect I think we shall all be content, but with all due deference to the last speaker I do not think that it reads in that way.

                        <para>- Lawfully, by virtue of a private Act of Parliament.. I acted as counsel for the promoters of the private line. I think nobody will deny that if the particular private line I am speaking of were put up after this Bill becomes law, and it then had to be removed, the promoters would have to pay. All the Postmaster-General asks is that he should be put in the same position in reference to the State lines he takes over in regard to private lines already erected as he is in at the present moment in reference to private lines put up hereafter. In. Western Australia it was considered a very great grievance that the lines of the public authority having control of the telegraph system should have been injuriously affected by the private lines. Nothing was done in that case; but I think it should be in the power of the Postmaster-General to say to these people - "Though your lines were put up before this Bill became law, you arc in exactly the same position as if you put up the lines after I was clothed with the authority. I give you notice by this Act that you put them up at your own risk inasmuch as if you interfere with public property you take the consequences ; and it is not because the State of "Western Australia has not hitherto asked you to remove those lines, that the Postmaster-General of the Commonwealth on taking over the work should be precluded from the same power of removing, at your expense, that the State of Western Australia would have had if it had chosen to exercise the right." </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I should like to point out to the Committee that it is quite obvious to us who are arguing this matter in reference to a case that we know well, that at the present time the telegraph lines in Launceston are not being injuriously affected by the electric lighting lines. In that respect we feel confident that this Bill will not hurt us even if the words complained of are left in ; because ample provision has been made by legislative enactment to prevent any injury. The Postmaster-General may ask - " Why, then, are you making this fuss
                    I will tell him.

                        <para>- It seems to me that the honorable senator who has just sat down misapprehends the point. I understand now that he is supposing that if there' has been a certain line of telegraph erected before some other wires were put up, it would bo held that those wires were put up after the telegraph line was' constructed. The case, however, is as follows : - The department puts up a telegraph line. We find that it is injuriously affected by some other wire. The only question that will arise is - did we have our telegraph wire there before the private wire was put up ? If so, the private wire must be removed at the cost of the owner; but if that wire were there' before the telegraph line was erected, the removal must be at the cost of the department. </para>
