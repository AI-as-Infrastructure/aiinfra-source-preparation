                        <para>- I desire to ask you, sir, whether in view of the probability of late sittings being held during the session, it is your intention to arrange for the attendants not to be kept here throughout, as is done in another place ; that is whether you will arrange for a relay of attendants in the chamber ? </para>

                            <para>- May I be permitted sir, to call your attention to the absence of ventilation in the chamber. The question of kanaka labour was well ventilated yesterday, but I doubt whether the chamber was. I know that some honorable senators find the atmosphere very oppressive, and I do not see much opportunity for securing that ventilation which is certainly needful if we are to have late sittings. </para>

                        <para>- I shall have to consult the Executive with regard to the provision for late sittings. If arrangements have to be made for late sittings, other messengers will have to be appointed, I presume. To secure proper ventilation would necessitate enormous alterations at very large expense. If the ventilation of the chamber is defective, and honorable senators wish to remove the defects, the Senate should take action, as I have no funds and no power. </para>

                    <para>- I certainly understood from the Postmaster-General last night that he was most anxious to get rid of the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, and that he insisted on terminating the committee stage for that purpose. If the Immigration Restriction Bill has been hung up, it is not the fault of the Senate, but of the Government. Apparently the object is to deal with the Immigration Restriction Bill when there is a large attendance of senators, and if possible to deal with the Pacific Island Labourers Bill when we are tired out, as was the case yesterday. Even if it were legitimate to push through such a Bill in the small hours of the morning on one occasion, I venture with great respect to say that it is not legitimate to do it a second time. I hope the motion will be withdrawn. </para>

                    <para>- I should prefer that the Government went on with the Pacific Island Labourers Bill this afternoon. I am aware that there have been threats to delay the passage of the measure ; but the Government must recognise that the majority of honorable senators are prepared to assist them in every possible way. </para>

                    <para>. - I moved the motion in the ordinary way because it appeared to me that it would be more convenient in the arrangement of business to take the Immigration Restriction Bill and leave the Pacific Island Labourers Bill until the first named measure had been passed through commiteed. But although the Postmaster-General made no promise to go on with the latter Bill to-day, I find that there has been some misunderstanding about it. Rather than that there should be any feeling that the Senate has not been fairly treated, I will withdraw the motion. But I venture to express the hope that as there has been a full discussion already honorable senators will not think it necessary to interfere with the carrying out of the programme which the Government have in view, and that is to get the Immigration Restriction Bill finished - at all events as far as concerns the committee stage -by to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- I feel myself in a position of considerable difficulty in relation to this important clause. It is a serious pity that clause 8 in its present form appears in the Bill at all. It certainly was not in the Bill up to a late hour yesterday, and it is a blot in our legislation on the subject. Until my attention was directed to it I was not aware that the clause had been altered and made so mischievous. The original provision was that any kanakas in Queensland who had been out of employment for a space of one month, prior to 1906, might be brought before a magistrate and ordered- to be returned to the islands from which they came. From the point of view of the policy of the Bill, that was not unreasonable, but it is altogether an unreasonable thing to provide that the court shall simply order a 'kanaka to be deported without specifying where he is to be deported to, or what is to be the ultimate fate of this poor unfortunate victim of this sentence of banishment - a sentence of banishment in respect of the mere fact of his innocent presence, so far as he is concerned, in the country to which he has been brought. Really, a more inhuman provision could not be conceived. It is all very well to say that the Executive Government has control, but what discretion has the magistrate? I should be perfectly agreeable if we gave a discretion to the court, and introduced a limitation as to the places to which these unfortunate people could be sent. It is discretionary with the policeman to bring a man before the court, but the court has no discretion whatever. There might be a thousand reasons why the kanaka should not be deported, but the court could not take them into consideration. The court could exercise no modifying discretion whatever; its sole power is imperatively to make an order that the kanaka shall be deported. It would have been perfectly competent to provide that the islander should be returned to the island from which he came, "if possible," or, if not, to some definite series of islands within certain limited degrees of latitude. We are dealing here with a provision which is to apply to 4,000 kanakas - to speak of them alone - who have been in Queensland for five or six years, and who are, so to speak, acclimatized, who have become a accustomed to our civilization and who have £28,000 in the savings bank. </para>

                        <para>- I know that is what we are doing. It will be a monstrous thing if this clause remains as it appears in the Bill ; it will be a blot, for which we will all be sorry, upon the first volume of the statute - book of this Commonwealth. I hope it will be modified, and that we shall indicate the place to which these people are to be expatriated - because it is not repatriation ; they are not to be sent back to their original home ; it is expatriation from their adopted home without any other place being indicated to which they are to go. I say we are treating them under this provision worse than brute beasts. It is like sending cattle that have innocently trespassed on our lands out on to the barren roads. We would not treat a dumb animal in such a manner as this clause proposes to empower the authorities to treat these kanakas. Between starvation and massacre the choice is perhaps not very great, but we in passing this Bill should certainly exercise those feelings of humanity of which we so proudly boast, and should seek to make a provision of which we shall not be ashamed hereafter, when it makes its appearance on our statute-book. </para>

I was not aware then of the way in which clause 8 had been altered. I now look upon it as a most dreadful clause. I was quite willing to allow the kanakas to go back under the clause as it stood when I left the chamber last evening, but I arn totally against the clause in its present mutilated form. "We might have the most perfect confidence in Government, Judges, and officers, but surely it is our duty to prevent the possibility of a gross injustice being done to our fellow creatures. I know that some of these kanakas have been in Australia for over twenty years. I know one in Melbourne who has been in the employment of a bank manager for over 22 years. </para>

I am beginning to lose confidence, and to think that they are inclined bo submit to a. temporary power for ulterior purposes. I do not know what may happen. I suppose w'e cannot alter the Bill. I protest loudly and emphatically at such a clause being placed on the statute-book. I am amazed to find any human being agreeing to the enactment of such a provision. Do honorable senators wish to treat human beings worse than dogs? Surely that is not statesmanship. I could not support a Government capable of doing this thing; Thank God I am independent of all Governments. This clause- was amended in a thin committee. </para>

                    <para>- I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that he should agree to this request. In the State Parliament, with which I was connected so long, the practice was not to bring forward amendments after the usual hour of sitting passed. This is not the first occasion upon which the Government have snatched a majority by what I consider are not fair means. I have supported the Government, and I intend to do so ; but I certainly cannot countenance the action of the Government in taking advantage of even a minority. All proposed amendments to be moved ought to be printed, and honorable senators would then be able to see the drift of the Government proposals. To say that they left the Senate before the adjournment is not exactly an answer to the complaint made by honorable senators on the other side. They went away because they believed that the provisions of the Bill, as printed, would be adhered to. That was my own opinion, and although I am not prepared to say that I would not have accepted the amendment - probably I would - I think the committee should have had an opportunity of discussing it. I would urge the Postmaster-General to allow these two clauses to be recommitted on that ground. A strong Government should not attempt to snatch a majority in a way that any section of the Senate might characterize as unfair. </para>

                        <para>- The clause as amended leaves it open to the Governor-General in Council to send each one of these kanakas back to the place whence he came, if it be ascertained, but it removed the restriction which previously existed. Let honorable senators consider how injuriously that restriction might have operated. In many cases we are told that the islands have been . depopulated. Are we to be bound to deport a kanaka to a place from which his people and tribe have disappeared? Or are we to bc bound to take him to a place occupied by his own or some other tribe that may be hostile to him ? Is it not much better that we should have an opportunity of consulting the views and wishes of the kanaka himself ? </para>

                        <para>- How can the amendment suggested make it more workable? It will only be a restriction under which he must be sent to the place from which he came. It is far better to leave it open to the Governor-General in Council, when if a kanaka desire to be returned to the place from which he came he "can be returned there, and if he desires to be sent to some other island or to some other part of the same island, the Governor-General in Council can direct his deportation accordingly. The amendment made last night is entirely in favour of the kanaka as making his deportation a process calculated to be more advantageous to him than it would be under the clause as it stood before. </para>

                        <para>- I do not call it "banishment." Honorable senators can call it by any term the}' like, but it brings us back to this : That we must have the power to send the kanakas away from Australia, or they must remain here. Honorable senators must make up their minds to accept one position or the other. If there is to be no power of deportation the kanakas will have the right to remain in Australia for all time, and I think that would be a most deplorable thing. There have been great mistakes in connexion with this matter, and it is generally regretted that the kanakas ever came here. There is a general feeling in Australia that at whatever cost these mistakes of the past must be repaired. The only way in which they can be repaired is by passing some provision of this kind for the deportation of the kanaka. If honorable senators agree with me on these points, what can be the advantage of going into committee. The Senate can decide now whether the amendment made last night is of such a character that we should reverse it. I think the amendment is an improvement on the Bill as it stood, and there would be no advantage whatever in going into committee to reconsider it. I am bound to oppose the amendment. </para>

                        <para>.- I think I am justified in referring to these two remarkable instances of chickens coming home to roost with very great celerity. There will be just as much trouble over this clause. If the Minister refuses to correct the blunder which was made very hastily, and at a late hour, the clause will not find its way on to the statute-book. The time which has been occupied this afternoon with this discussion will have been wasted, because the matter will be dealt with elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>.- The Postmaster-General should remember that mere stubbornness does not represent strength, nor sulkiness determination. In resisting this reasonable demand, he is taking up an attitude that will not help him in the future. His influence here is the influence that comes of courtesy and a friendly dealing with public business. In a Chamber whose numerical strength is small he would consult the speedy transaction of business by meeting considerate applications with willingness, and not by taking up an attitude of dogged persistency, obstinacy, and refusal to comply with demands that have been reduced to the smallest possible point. I tried to word this amendment so as to exclude even the possibility of dealing with the dates in the Bill. I might just as well have asked the Senate to recommit the whole Bill. I could have moved for recommittal of the whole Bill, and discussed every line of it. If I had desired to occupy the time of the Senate I could have spoken on the Bill for hours. </para>

These places are : Brisbane, 243 ; Townsville, 24 ;Rockhampton, 195 ; Bundaberg, 30. This give a total of 492 for the whole of Queensland. </para>

                    <para>- I am referring to the many misstatements which have been made on both sides. No doubt they have been made with the best intentions ; but can any one assert for one moment that the evidence is not conflicting ? Those of us who have no interest in the industry desire only to get at the facts. Every honor able senator has, I hope, the sense of justice that I claim for myself, but if any honorable senator votes against my motion, I shall doubt whether he has an evenly-balanced mind ora sense of proportion. I intend to conclude by reading a few lines from the petition presented to the Senate by the Premier of Queensland. This gentleman is speaking on behalf of his State. The people of the State are dumb before him, and no one dares to move a vote of want of confidence in him. It is idle for us to say that the four or five honorable senators from that State who occupy seats in the labour corner represent the views of the people there upon this question. </para>

My information was taken from the report of the officer in charge of the Queensland Labour Bureau and Relief department for 1900. Let us see what the officer in charge of that department in the Cardwell district has to say in this report. At page 5 the following passage will be found - </para>

                <para>I see by your amendment in the Senate on the 29th November, that you would be in favour of kanakas over five years' residence in the colony remaining. I may be out of order in writing to you on the great question of the day. I would ask you to accept the cause as my apology. The South Sea Island "Boys" have now formed themselves into an association, and about 1,000 of them have given their names to a petition which is not yet formulated in its entirety. The work of obtaining names, &amp;c, is proceeding. One of their claims is that they may be allowed to remain in the State, and not be forced back to their islands where their friends are dead, and perhaps the whole of their tribe slaughtered, and they, too, would meet with the same fate. The "boys" do not wish to be considered slaves, but are quite satisfied with their conditions, and claim that they are the first coloured race that came to Queensland, and that they were brought here under British rule, and also when they were engaged by the Government agent, they were given to understand that they would be free after their first term of engagement was up. This is proved by the large number of " boys " in the State, now ranging from 34 years to 3. Hundreds of " boys" are here more than twenty years, also a few natives, one 28, another 15,andsoon.The"boys" also state in the order of things, they being the first to come should be last to go of the coloured races. There is not a featherweight of truth in the statement that white women cannot walk the streets for them. It is a cruel libel on the innocent who cannot defend themselves. </para>

But the letter shows that a petition is being improperly signed, and is to be presented for the purpose of influencing the Senate. I think every elector has a right to approach the Senate by petition in a proper manner. But what weight are we to attach to a petition which is signed before it is formulated ? What weight can we attach to the statements of honorable senators that they are in favour of stopping this traffic, when all their efforts are directed to delay the Bill, in order that it may be defeated ? </para>

                        <para>- There are none in the Cairns cane-fields who do not use kanakas. That statement cannot honestly be contradicted, because it is taken from an official source. It only shows the necessity for an inquiry. Are honorable senators afraid of an inquiry ? If not, why do they object to this motion ? An inquiry is asked for by the Premier and people of Queensland, by municipal councils, and various institutions. If an inquiry is refused the State of Queensland will have good reason to take umbrage at the action of this Parliament, especially as the measure has been forced on with such undue haste. There was no necessity to legislate during this session. To launch the Bill in the first few weeks of the life of the first Parliament was a gross injustice. A man has no heart to speak when he knows that anything he may say or do will be of no avail. The numbers are up, and nothing that may be said will convince honorable senators. There can be nothing wrong if the truth is as stated by senators opposite, in granting an inquiry. If they are satisfied that their statements are true, the inquiry will justify them, whilst at the same .time the Queensland people will be pleased. Is the Senate going to decline to listen to the prayers of the petitions that have been presented? Surely the petition of 1,000 kanakas is entitled to some consideration. </para>

We cannot complain because their petition has been written out for them by some one else. It is not everybody who can properly formulate a petition to Parliament. I hope that the Senate will not refuse the reasonable request which is made. I heartily support the amendment, and if an inquiry is held, and the evidence is in favour of a Bill of this description, I promise to vote for it. </para>

                    <para>Distinguished visitors to Childers - Mistress Fanny and Master Jimmy Nicole - made things (black) hum here last Saturday and Sunday. Fanny is a funny old frau; at various dates in her career - and I sometimes think at one and the same time - she has been Theosophist, Calathumpian, Spiritualist, Lemurian, Christian scientist, Plymouth rook, Ante-deluvian, Sadducee, Pharisee, and a - well, always a dreary traveller and general nuisance. The whirligig of time has wrought many queer changes in the career of Fanny and Jimmy : from a Lord knows what to hashhouse keeper, swankey seller, horse doctor, and now kanaka agitator. </para>

                    <para>- For my own part I wish to distinctly deny the charge which has been made that certain honorable senators seek to obstruct the course of legislation in this matter. I have not conferred with any honorable senator on the subject. When I left the chamber last night I did not know what was going to be done, nor did I learn what had happened until I read the newspapers this morning. I have always held the opinion that this is a matter of very great importance, requiring to be dealt with in the most earnest manner. I think it would be a fair and proper thing to ask the Postmaster-General to reply to the statement made in Brisbane that he has broken faith with the Philp Government. </para>

                        <para>Kato was willing to admit that, from a material point of view, there wa3 no very great grievance of which Japan could complain. The actual immigration was very small, and the class of Japanese who chiefly desired to enter the Australasian colonies were exempted by special provision from the prohibitions of the colonial Bills. But the point which had caused a painful- feeling in Japan was not that the operation of the prohibition would be such as to exclude a certain number of Japanese from immigrating into Australasia, but that Japan should be spoken of in formal documents, such as the colonial Acts, as if the Japanese were on the same level of morality and civilization as Chinese, or other less advanced populations of Asia. . . M. Kato maintained that the provision in the Act passed by the colony of Natal that immigrants should write out a certificate in some European language would practically effect the object of the colonies, as only educated Japanese would be able to pass the test, and of these very few would wish to emigrate. This result, he added, would even more certainly be obtained with regard to other Asiatic countries where general education is less advanced than in Japan, and frauds could be prevented by more or less frequent changes in the certificate. </para>

Disqualification by educational tests, such as arc embodied in the immigration laws of various colonies, is not a measure to which the Government of Japan or any other Government can take exception in behalf of its subjects ; and if the particular tests in these laws are not regarded as sufficiently stringent there is no reason why more stringent and effective ones of a similar character should not be adopted. </para>

In 1897 we agreed with our colonies that a certain form of legislation, which was not then deemed to be offensive to you, and which you were willing to accept, could be adopted. We practically entered into an arrangement with our colonies that that should be the form of legislation for carrying out this object. Whatever you may think, we shall stand by that arrangement, and if they send home a measure on those lines we will assent to it."

                        <para>- I do not think there is any other inference to be drawn from the despatches. ' If the honorable senator is so careful of the honour of the British Government that he wishes to go further than they do, I can understand his position, but I cannot understand how any man who realises that there must be some legislation restricting the immigration of Asiatics, can refuse to accept the educational test, knowing perfectly well that the only alternative to that is the test of the colour line, which has been hinted at already, and which was unsuccessfully proposed in another Chamber. I refer to this because I am afraid that those who are really anxious to see this measure carried into practical affect, for the securing of a white Australia, have not fully realised the position. </para>

                    <para>- I have been somewhat embarrassed in connexion with the speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, which, certainly to a large extent, has been a second-reading speech. While it is quite true that a considerable amount of latitude must be permitted to the leader of the Senate, yet I feel that it will be very difficult to prevent other honorable senators from dealing with the various matters to which he has referred, if he goes into them fully. I would therefore urge him to confine his remarks to the amendment. </para>

                <para>In my opinion, the better educated these people are the more undesirable citizens of Australia they most undoubtedly will be. It is in the interests of the capitalistic class that these people should be permitted to enter, but against the interests of the 2-1 j3 working classes. As the large majority of the people of Australia are workers, they would be foolish if they permitted Asiatic subjects of the King of England, or of the Mikado of Japan, or of the Emperor or Empress of China to enter. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think so. I do not impute motives. It has been said to-night that certain honorable senators have banded together in relation to this measure. I have not been asked by any honorable senator how I am going to vote upon this amendment or upon the Bill generally, and I know of no plotting or scheming in connexion with the matter. I have listened to the debate and formed my own conclusions, and. I shall take the course which, in my humble judgement, will be the proper one for me to follow as the representative of those who have sent me here. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator distinctly declared - and I took down his words - that the result of moving the amendment would be that when the words were excised we should refuse to insert the other words proposed. Then the Opposition would be triumphant, said the honorable and learned senator, in that dramatic manner of his. </para>

We are sent here by the voice of Australia for the purpose of providing by legislation for the exclusion of coloured aliens. </para>

                        <para>- I said before that we were for a white Australia, and that any one who wished an exception to be made, as the- Government wished to make an exception in dealing with the kanakas, should give reasons in favour of it. The policy of this country is the policy of a white Australia. Every one of us is substantially pledged to that policy. If it is to be followed out, it means that we should put upon our statute - book a declaration that the colour which we desire to protect Australia from is the only foundation for the exclusion of aliens. That is what I favour. Then it is said that we must not do it, because, first of all, Mi-. Chamberlain would not like it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not morbidly sensitive in any way, but surely it is a gross imputation upon the sincerity of the conduct of an honorable senator to say that he has adopted a particular course of action because he does not care whether the Bill passes or not. I say it is distinctly offensive. It is an imputation on my sincerity in the course I am pursuing, and I distinctly take exception to it. It is not a matter of what is reasonable, but whether the remark is offensive to me or not. If it is offensive to me, it ought to be withdrawn, and I call upon you to direct that the expression be 'withdrawn. </para>

                        <para>- He may be a good man, but I utterly differ from my honorable and learned friend. I am ashamed of the arguments he has used. He has not tackled the subject. He has simply tried to skim over the surface, He has given a few surface arguments in favour of an amendment which he must know will embarrass the Imperial Government and which he does know will embarrass the Commonwealth Government. </para>
