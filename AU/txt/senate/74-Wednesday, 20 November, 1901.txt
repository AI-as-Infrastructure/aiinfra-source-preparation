Much reliance is not, however, placed on such, but, as stated above, the packages and contents themselves a. re carefully examined and duty assessed by the officers.

(5) The information supplied is "that such bus been the case," but it may be mentioned in regard to this question and No. 6, that the matter relates to the administration of State law only, and does not come within the scope of the Department of Trade and Customs at present.

                    <para>. - I think it advisable, if the Senate is to express an opinion upon this matter, that action should not be taken now. Of course, sir, the action which you have suggested would have the effect of creating a precedent which might have far-reaching consequences. It is desirable that honorable senators should have an opportunity of considering the matter in all its bearings before the Senate departs from the established usage in all British Parliaments, that a House of Parliament can be approached only by petition. </para>

                    <para>- Although this is an absolutely novel procedure, I think it would be wise for the Senate at all times] to leave itself open to receive a communication from a State Government, because, sir, as you pointed out, its position is entirely distinct in certain respects from that of the Upper House in the old country or in a State. The Senate is peculiarly constituted, inasmuch as it represents the States directly. Therefore it should be open at all times to receive any suggestions or any views which a State may desire to submit, always provided that those views are presented by the duly recognised authorities or representatives of the State. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Whatever the views of the State Government may be, so long as the question is one on which the State is interested - and it would be only on a great public matter that a State would attempt to make its views known to the Senate - it is only reasonable that its communication should be received. Of course, I am aware that a State can make its views known through its representatives. But at the same time there is a recognised authority in the State - the Government of the day. If it makes a mistake in the views which it puts before a body like the Senate it will be amenable not only to the members of its Legislature, but to the people of the State it represents. I am rather sorry that the Postmaster-General should have considered it necessary to take exception to the action suggested by you, sir, on the present occasion. </para>

                        <para>- It is a document written by the Prime Minister of Queensland. It is addressed to "The honorable the President and Members of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia." It is a statement made by the Premier of Queensland, as representing that State, in reference to a Bill which is now before the Commonwealth Parliament. The Premier of Queensland admits that the procedure that he wishes to see adopted is novel. For the reasons I have already given, I have thought that it would be convenient and proper to allow the communication to be read. But of course it is a matter for the Senate to decide. I do not in any way. desire to take the Senate unawares. I want the Senate to have an opportunity of considering the question in all its bearings, and as a whole, and not in relation to this particular Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It is a communication, and it is signed on behalf of the State of Queensland. That is a marvellous thing. What right has the Premier of Queensland to sign such a document on behalf of the whole State? Before we come to a conclusion on a matter like this, we should be very careful not to form a dangerous precedent. Possibly I shall have something further to say on the matter when I have seen the contents of the document, which I presume we shall be allowed to read? </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not propose to make them exactly similar, because we have had a discussion previously upon the Appropriation Bill, when we substantially agreed that this would be the proper form of expression to use. We agreed then, I think, that the proper form was not that the Senate is " willing to vote " a sum, but that the Senate is willing to give " parliamentary sanction " to the vote. </para>

                    <para>The estimate of revenue for the coming financial year amounts to £20,900, or £5,325 over that of the present year. The principal items in which an increase is expected are - Customs, £700 ; land sales, £1,660 ; gold-field receipts, £800 ; and the sales of the new issue of the postage stamps, £500. </para>
                    <para>The only difficult items to estimate are the two relating to lands and surveys. I may state that the Chief Government Surveyor's original estimate was much larger, but the Executive Council did not consider it well to calculate on too high a problematical amount, and reduced it to the figures given above. A good deal will of course depend on whether the Government of New South Wales will withdraw its opposition to the application of the Hall Sound Company for the . 100,000 acres of land for agricultural purposes. </para>
                    <para>The company have officially informed me that unless the objection to it, of which the New South Wales Government gave Your Excellency's Government notice last year, on the first intimation of the application, is allowed to lapse, they will withdraw at once altogether from any further enterprise in the possession ; while, should their application be successful, they will be prepared to invest a large amount of capital and proceed at once with their enterprise. In the interests, therefore, of the financial administration of the possession, I should be glad to know at an early date whether there is any likelihood of the opposition to the company's application being withdrawn. I fear that otherwise, not only shall we lose the first bona fide chance of material agricultural development which has occurred since I have been in the possession, but that others who may be intending to undertake similar enterprises will be discouraged and withdraw from them. </para>

                    <para>The figures for the expenditure for the first quarter of the coming financial year - £8,851 5s. - are based on the present year's estimates, with certain additions, viz., (1) the inclusion, as directed, of the present survey staff; (2) the appointments made and approved during the present year ; (3) certain small increments to the salaries of subordinate officers, in no case exceeding £25, which had been promised to them from the first of July ; and (4) certain items under constabulary, gaols, &amp;c, which are found to be insufficient for present actual requirements. With these exceptions, and the provision for the 4 per cent interest on the special survey loan of £3,000 made by the Queensland Government towards the end of last year, and the cost of the new postage stamps, the figures for 1900-I have been adhered to as strictly as possible, in accordance with what I stated in my telegraphic request for authority to pass the Temporary Appropriation Ordinance, although I was not at the time aware that the one-fourth of the total of the last Estimates, to which I intended to confine myself, except for the survey staff, would have to be exceeded. </para>

                        <para>- No; it will be made good by the contributing States. I desire now to refer to the negotiations that have taken place between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. When the affairs of the States were taken over by the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth incurred a certain amount of responsibility to carry out agreements which the States had undertaken. Therefore a certain amount of responsibility in connexion with New Guinea immediately devolved upon the Commonwealth. The principal question that appears to me to have arisen was as to what form the future government of the dependency should take - whether an agreement similar to that in existence before with regard to the three contributing States should be entered into by the Commonwealth; or whether British New Guinea should be accepted by the Commonwealth as a territory. </para>

                <para>Referring to your telegram of loth August, His Majesty's Government quite prepared to approve British New Guinea being placed under Commonwealth Government, but much regret impossible to ask Imperial Parliament for Imperial contribution towards expenses of Administration. Please obtain from Governor of Queensland my despatch, British New Guinea, No. 23, of 8th June, 1898, which explains. </para>

                    <para>In dealing with these questions, it must not be forgotten that British New Guinea was annexed only in response to the unanimous demand of Australia, and on the understanding that the Australian colonies would pay for the administration of the new dependency, which was to be to all intends and purposes an Australian possession. </para>
                    <para>It is true that Her Majesty's Government have since materially contributed to the expense of the administration of the dependence, but each year it is becoming more difficult for them to induce the House of Commons to vote money for the administration of a possession in which the taxpayer of the United Kingdom has ' so little direct commercial interest ; it is felt that the time has come when the grant-in-aid which has been made for so many years should cease. </para>
                    <para>Now, in the case of British New Guinea, it is. practically certain that if the possession is to be developed, it will be by Australian capital and. enterprise. What trade it at present does - amounting to less than £40,000 a year - is carried on with Australia. Experience in Fiji shows that the only enterprises which have been successful on a scale worth mentioning have been those of Australian companies or individuals, and it is unlikely that the fate of New Guinea will be different. The Australians are practically on the spot, and they have unlimited command of capital. The Australian, living in a sub-, tropical country, takes more kindly to tropical, life and work than the native of the United Kingdom. Similarly, the trade of Fiji is wholly with Australia ; and although, no doubt, some part of it is in goods from this country, or for export to this country, there is not, and probably never will be, any direct trade between the United Kingdom and Fiji. The distance is too great, and there is a sufficient market in Australia both to buy in and to sell in. </para>
                    <para>The interest of the English exporter, therefore, in the Pacific market, is only indirect. It is part of the market of his Australian customer, and it is on the Australian intermediary that he must rely for the exploitation of that market. It is too small to make it worth his while to establish a direct trade, especially when he might thereby offend a large and influential supporter. </para>

If desired Such powers would include appointment of all officers from Lieutenant-Governor downwards on occurrence of vacancies. His Majesty's Government most earnestly hope that in the interests of British New Guinea, and of Australia itself, with which the possession is so closely connected as natural dependency, your Government will either take over administration at once, or will come to some temporary understanding with Government of Queensland for carrying on administration, pending arrangement of details, in order that immediate embarrassment of British New Guinea may be relieved. </para>

                    <para>The Commonwealth Government express the hope that the Secretary of State before he finally refuses to ask the Imperial Parliament to contribute a sum towards the maintenance of the possession, may give his kind consideration to the difficulties of the Commonwealth, in undertaking anything more than the minimum of necessary expenditure, owing to the incidence and pressure of sections 87, 89, and 93 of the Constitution, which were inserted to prevent the finances of the States from suffering during the transition period. These, while they provide security to 21 s 2 the revenues of the States, must greatly increase the caution of the Commonwealth in the undertaking of new enterprises, which involve any considerable expenditure. </para>
                    <para>Although three of the States have borne the expense of the administration in equal proportions since the discontinuance of the Imperial contribution, yet if that expense be now undertaken by the Commonwealth it must be regarded as new, and not as transferred expenditure - it not having been incurred in connexion with any of the transferred departments. </para>
                    <para>The three States which formerly contributed are very anxious that the Commonwealth should relieve them of the burden they have hitherto borne ; but it appears to be difficult, under the Constitution, for the Commonwealth Government to undertake the administration of the possession, except as a territory of the Commonwealth. Such a course will involve the Government in the liability to greater expenditure than has hitherto been necessitated. </para>
                    <para>If, owing to financial obstacles, the Commonwealth were now compelled to decline the task of supervising the affairs of the possession, it is practically certain that the three States hitherto contributors would also decline any further expense or responsibility ; and it does not seem to your Excellency's Ministers that they should be forced to make a choice between the entire burden of the administration, and the leaving of the possession in a helpless position. </para>
                    <para>One of these results must ensue if His Majesty's Government is not prepared to co-operate, in some degree, in initiating the new order of things. </para>
                    <para>If the Commonwealth found itself compelled to decline to accept the burden, the whole of it would probably fall upon His Majesty's Government, if Imperial interests are to be maintained ; and while your Ministers are most unwilling that this should be the case, they think that, in view of such a possibility, they may venture to ask His Majesty's Government to reconsider the question. </para>

                    <para>I would remind your Ministers that, as was pointed out in the fourth paragraph of my despatch to the Governor of Queensland, No. 23, of the 8th June, 1898, British New Guinea was annexed only in response to the unanimous demands of Australia, and on the understanding that the Australian colonies would pay for the administration of the new dependency, which was to be to all intents and purposes an Australian  possession. </para>
                    <para>I also pointed out in that despatch that the bulk of the trade of the dependency was with Australia, and that this will almost certainly continue to be the case. In answer, your Ministers observe that a large part of the profits of such trade must accrue to British manufacturers and exporters, whose interest is none the less real because it is conducted by Australian intermediaries. It is undoubtedly true that some profit will accrue to the British manufacturer and exporter ; but since the total value of the imports into the possession, including specie, amounted in 1899-1900 only to about £72,000, and of these imports a considerable quantity wore articles which were, in all probability, originally produced in Australia, it can hardly be contended that the profits accruing to this country will amount to anything like the sum of £7,000 a year, which it is suggested that the United Kingdom should contribute towards the support of the dependency. </para>
                    <para>But quite apart from the question of the actual profit accruing to this country from trade with British New Guinea, His Majesty's Government cannot admit the general proposition that they are in equity bound to contribute to the expense of the local administration of any part of His Majesty's dominions with which the United Kingdom has commercial relations. </para>
                    <para>Your Ministers will, I cannot doubt, on reflection readily agree that the admission of such a principle would burden the Imperial Exchequer with indefinite liabilities, and commit His Majesty's Government to contributing, if asked, to the support of the local government in every part of the British Empire. </para>
                    <para>Your Ministers draw attention to the financial difficulties which the Commonwealth Government will have to face during the next few years owing to the provisions of sections 87, 89, and 93 of the Constitution Act, and the consequent necessity of keeping down expenditure to a minimum. His Majesty's Government appreciate the position of your Government in this respect ; but, on the other hand, they have in mind the abnormally heavy war charges which at the present time the mother country is called upon to bear, and, having regard to the powers of taxation possessed by the Commonwealth Government and the resources at its disposal, they cannot believe that the addition to the expenditure of £7,000 a year will cause any serious embarrassment. An increase of less than one-sixtieth in the annual Customs and Excise revenue from New South Wales alone would produce £28,000, and three quarters of this sum would not be required by your Government to meet the additional expenditure, and would be returned to the taxpayers through the medium of the finances of their respective States. </para>
                    <para>For these reasons, His Majesty's Government much regret that they cannot accept the arguments urged in your telegram of the 14th inst. , and they see no sufficient reason to justify them in inviting Parliament to make any grant towards the expenses of the administration of British New Guinea. </para>

                    <para>- The question that has been raised by the motion of the Postmaster-General seems to me to be both urgent and difficult. The urgency of it is indicated by the second paragraph, and I do not think that any honorable senator will have any doubt as to the difficulty if he carefully considers paragraph 1. If I were inclined to find any fault with the Government with regard to their management of the New Guinea question, I should say that they had delayed the matter too long. With regard to paragraph 2 of the motion, which asks the Commonwealth Parliament to give its sanction to the appropriation of £20,000 a year from the 1st July last, it is very desirable and necessary that that should be done, Ignoring the example of the Postmaster-General, I shall assume that most honorable senators have read the correspondence which has been circulated. If they have failed to read it, they certainly have omitted to peruse a document which is very interesting; and if they have read it they will see that the present Administrator of New Guinea, who seems to be a very able man, has been tried almost to the verge of distraction and despair by the delay in connection with the settlement of this matter. It is obvious that the needs of the Administrator are very urgent indeed. The mere fact that he has had to get cheques for £700 guaranteed by the Government of Queensland because his account had been overdrawn to that extent, is sufficient indication of the straits he is in. We should, therefore, have no hesitation in passing the necessary measures for relieving him from his financial embarrassments. With regard to the term of five years, which is an ominous term so far as one Bill is concerned, it has an obvious and distinct reference to the Constitution. Five years is the period of the operation of the bookkeeping section. In spit of some objections that honorable senators might urge as to the term, I feel that if we are to vote money at all - and of that I have no doubt whatever - we should, at least, be prepared to vote the sum of £20,000 for the next five years. I should not be in favour of voting the money for any less term. Seeing that we have to face the question, and that the bookkeeping sections are what we all know them to be, a resolution that the £20,000 a year shall be granted for five years appears to me to be justifiable. When we come to paragraph 1, we have to consider a matter of very great importance. Only the other day in this Chamber it was pointed out that for the first time in our history we were dealing with legislation of an international character. It may safely be said that this is the first occasion on which the Senate has been called upon to initiate something like a foreign policy. It is also obvious that in initiating that foreign policy, if we follow the lines indicated by the Government - and I do not say that I am disposed to object to them - we shall initiate a foreign policy which will mean an expansion of our empire, if we may apply that term to the Commonwealth. At any rate, this is certainly a policy of expansion. It might be argued that all the advantages the Commonwealth would derive from the acquisition of British New Guinea would still accrue to us if the territory were entirely under the control of the Imperial Government. I agree with that view. I further say that I should have to take some time to consider whether or not that would be the more desirable solution of the question. But the correspondence shows that there is no such option open to us. It is perfectly evident to every one who reads the correspondence that the attitude of the Imperial Government on this matter is fixed and settled, and that it has decided that it will no longer administer, directly or indirectly, completely or partially, the territory of British New Guinea. Therefore, we have no option. New Guinea has to be administered either by the Commonwealth, or by one or more of the States under the circumstances that have been existing in the past. Out of that administration very large questions will arise in the future ; and perhaps it is worth while, seeing that this motion more or less commits the Senate - as it is intended to do - to the approval of this foreign policy, that we should, even at this early stage, consider what such policy indicates to us. I say at once that this matter will become much more important, and will show very much greater prominence when we come to consider - as some day we shall have to do - our contribution to the navy and to Imperial defence generally. Because it is obvious that as we are going to acquire this additional territory we may have to undertake the responsibility of protecting it. The protection that Australia herself gets is largely that of the British Navy, and I feel that when we come to consider our contributions to the Imperial Navy, we shall have to take seriously into consideration the expansion of our foreign policy in connection with the acquisition of New Guinea and possibly also of other islands in the Pacific. I regard this as merely a step. Our expansion is going to be a matter of very serious importance to us. We cannot hope to escape with the small contribution to the Imperial navy that we have hitherto had to pay. The acquisition of New Guinea alone will have a serious effect upon the subject; and, obviously, if we acquire, as possibly we may do, other islands in the Pacific, it cannot possibly escape our very careful consideration. Therefore, we shall have to face very much greater difficulties in the future than we have before us now. Another aspect of this expansion of our foreign policy is, of course, in relation to the measures passed with regard to our own affairs. When we consider the Bills we have lately had before us, we cannot help feeling that we ought to take into account what may possibly be the effect upon the Commonwealth of acquiring so large an extent of tropical country as is represented by British New Guinea. I can clearly see ahead of us some very large and serious questions in that respect. It is obvious that sugar may be grown in British New Guinea. It is certain that there is an enormous supply of black labour there. The population has been given as between 300,000 and 350,000 inhabitants. There are further considerations arising out of another Bill which is coming before us, namely, that embodying the Tariff. We shall have seriously to consider the operation of the Tariff with regard to the new territory we are proposing to acquire, and whether, when New Guinea becomes a Commonwealth territory, it is to be affected by the Tariff just as the States of the Commonwealth are affected. I may remind the Senate of the fact, that allied with this question, there is also that of the acquisition of the Northern Territory of South Australia. I put it to the Senate with every confidence that the acquisition of the Northern Territory is on exactly the same footing with regard to the Tariff as the acquisition of New Guinea. The mere fact that that territory is within our continent does not, in any way, differentiate its position from the position of New Guinea, which is separated from us by the sea. Both territories will be affected by a Tariff. I instance these difficulties because they occurred to me directly I heard of this question. There is one other aspect of the subject, that of the administration of New Guinea. It may be suggested that the Australian Commonwealth should find the necessary money, £20,000 a year, and allow Great Britain to administrate the territory. I do not consider it in any way desirable that Great Britain should administer New Guinea, and that we should pay the £20,000 a year. I wish honorable senators clearly to understand that I do not imagine for one moment that this Commonwealth, mighty and powerful as it is, and this Parliament, proud of it as we sometimes are - even to the verge of conceit - can better administer New Guinea than Great Britain could. The reason that might be urged for the administration of British New Guinea by the Imperial Government is that if the Imperial Government did administer the territory - no matter whether we found the funds or not - Great Britain would be responsible for it defence in the case of international complications arising. If the only condition of securing for British New Guinea the defence and protection of Great Britain, were to leave the administration of it in the hands of Great Britain, I should not be in favour of the Commonwealth undertaking the task ; because I am not anxious to see the Commonwealth of Australia start out upon a large and expensive scheme of naval as well as of military defence. We are not in a position yet, at any rate, to do that. But we can rely with the utmost confidence upon this fact - that if we do acquire British New Guinea and administer it, the onus which is upon the British Government of protecting this Commonwealth, must also be on the Imperial Government of protecting our territory. I have no doubt whatever, that if international complications should arise - and it is quite possible that they will arise, seeing that New Guinea is divided at present between three nations - we should look to Great Britain with every certainty to give us that naval assistance which we should expect from her in regard to this continent, if there were any danger of attack from any foreign power. For that reason, I should oppose the handing over of the administration of </para>

I would point out to the Postmaster-General that neither in its original form nor in the form in which it has been put before the Senate, could the motion give the Government the authority they want. The Government are going to do something which is slightly unconstitutional ; but I do not think it is possible for them to avoid the difficulty, and I do not intend to offer any opposition. </para>

                        <para>- I would ask the Postmaster-General to make his meaning clear. If he wants this motion to be carried he will have to be careful - I am speaking now as the candid friend - otherwise I do not believe it will be carried in its present form. I can scarcely believe that honorable senators who are in full sympathy with the policy of foreign expansion will consent to bind themselves to pass a Bill before they have even seen it. I shall probably be in favour of the Bill myself, for I support the acquisition of this territory, and hope that a Bill will be brought down which we shall be able to carry ; but it is another thing to pledge ourselves now to accept a Bill for the acquisition of British New Guinea. A Bill cannot be spoken of in that comprehensive way. The details of a Bill are what determine us in giving our consent to it; and to agree blindly to a Bill before we see it, seems to me to be more than can be expected of us. I propose that we express our ready willingness - if honorable senators like to put it in that way - to consider a measure for the acceptance of British New Guinea as a territory. I shall vote for the granting of £20,000 for a period of five years without the slightest hesitation ; but if we are to be asked to agree to pass a Bill, it should be in terms that will not commit us hopelessly. I speak in no spirit of opposition ; but the wording of the paragraph does not appeal to me. </para>

                        <para>- We shall spend the money, regardless of the way in which this motion is framed. There is undoubtedly a question involved in the alteration of the wording. I prefer to hear what honorable senators have to say upon the matter, and do not feel inclined to pursue the question any further. I recognise that this means the initiation of a foreign policy and possible international complications, but my own opinion is that we are placed in a position which demands immediate action. There is no time for hesitation as to whether this policy is desirable or not, and putting the thing briefly, I believe that our chief chance of safety and success lies in acting not only with promptitude, but with confidence and boldness. </para>

                    <para>I would remind your Ministers that as was pointed out in the fourth paragraph of my despatch to the Governor of Queensland, No. 23 of the 8th June, 1898, British New Guinea was annexed only in response to the unanimous demand of Australia and on the understanding that the Australian Colonies would pay for the administration of the new dependency which was to be to all intents and purposes an Australian possession. </para>

                        <para>- The sugar-planters that some honorable senators are doing their level best to drive out of Australia may, in self-defence, go up there. With regard to the so-called land syndicates, it is quite true that one formed in Great Britain applied for over 200,000 acres. They sent out surveyors and had surveys made, and when their proposals were refused, they wanted their preliminary expenses refunded to them. I do not know anything about the rights and wrongs of the matter, but I believe the Government acted wisely in declining to refund their expenses. With regard to the Hall Sound Company, I probably know more about it than some honorable senators present. There has been nothing in connexion with that company from start to finish that has not been perfectly straightforward. My impression is that if they are refused the freehold of the land for which they applied they will be willing to take it up upon, leasehold, but, of course, they will want, some security that they shall have some return on the money they spend. Some persons, think it is a sin to buy an acre of land nowadays, and, personally, I should like to seethe land legislation of New Guinea conducted on the leasing principle. But if leases are granted, they should be for 50* years or more, because if leases for only paltry terms are granted, we cannot expect people to undertake an expenditure of thousands of pounds. I hope that in this, matter we shall not adopt the miserable: views which some persons nowadays enunciate. I am so anxious to see th&amp; business of the country go on, that I shall not intrude upon the time of the Senate: further than to say that I am cordially with the Government in the action they have taken, and I only wish they had taken it. months ago. </para>

                    <para>- I shall not detain the Senate at any great length.. If this was an original proposal that Australia should have anything to do with New Guinea, I think I should be found voting against it. I submit that we have enough territory within our coastline to keep us occupied for the next century. I am not one of those who are so very much enamoured of foreign expansion, and the necessity for a great navy and for placing ourselves upon a high military pedestal. If we go along the lines of peace we will, I think, do very much more good for our day and generation. I, of course, am bound in. the interests of the State I represent, to vote for this motion. I can hardly see how we can avoid taking over British New Guinea, but I do hope that when the Government bring in a Bill to govern that territory it will be a comprehensive measure, and will have for its main object the proper treatment of some 300,000 natives who are there. "What is going on in New Guinea at the present time appears to me to be very much like what took place in the early history of Australia. The missionaries have gone there with the very best of intentions, and they have been followed by traders. Some of these traders are very greedy and grasping persons, and are doing their level best in the first place to avail themselves of all native labour, and if in availing themselves of that labour they kill off a few hundred thousand, it does not appear to matter very much to them. </para>

                <para>The number of native labourers employed throughout the past year has exceeded the previous year by more than one-half. The general tone and contentment of the natives employed has not been as satisfactory as it might have been. From what I have been told, and from what I have seen myself, most of the employers not only wish for the cheapest labour on the face of the earth, but they expect the natives to be bound on the expiration of their services to buy goods from them out of the small sum they receive for their labour, at a price that will enable the seller to make at least 200 per cent, profit. One person stated in the office, at Daru, when it was refused to sign on natives to be paid off at the place they were going to work at, that he thought it a shame that they could not get half of the wages paid back, if not all, in this fashion. These methods of dealing are resorted to by those employers who are living on their wits, and who only make enough from one year's end to another to exist on. The chief complaints made by the natives are insufficient food and bad accommodation. The employers complain that the natives are lazy, sulky, and obstinate. 21 t 2 </para>
                <para>Over 50 natives came to Daru and complained of their food supply. The same natives had on three occasions deserted on the ground of insufficient food. They were advised to return to their employer. Their answer was - "No, we will all go to gaol first. We get food there." The employer was questioned as to the food supply, and he stated that when rice only was supplied it was 1 lb. per day per man. He was asked if he could work in the open air for twelve months on lib. of rice per day. '* No," said he, "lam not a nigger." When sago was supplied, two bundles only were given to over 60 men - about 45 lb. per day - at a cost to the employer of about 6d. at the outside. The place of employment was inspected and the natives' statements were found to be perfectly true. For there could be seen hundreds of palms cut down in scrub by the labourers for food, and they were driven to stealing sago palms the property of the surrounding tribes. The wages of these natives was 5s. per month. Referring to the complaints by the employers of the laziness and obstinacy of the natives, this, no doubt, is a good deal due to the above treatment, to the lack of proper supervision and attention, and to the natives not understanding the orders given to them. </para>

                        <para>- This statement was made without contradiction or limitation. If we are to develop the northern part of Queensland, if we are to take over the Northern Territory and develop it, we shall have to consider what We shall do with these 350,000 black subjects of ours. I would point out to my honorable friends in the Labour corner who hope that the laws under which we take over the territory will be broad and comprehensive, that it is quite probable that they will be broad and comprehensive, but I hope that they will be more statesmanlike, more based on humanity than some of the legislation which has passed through this Chamber. We hardly know what will be done about the question of the kanakas, and sugar growing, and the development of a land which is hardly fit for a white man to work in, and when it will be admitted that the time has arrived for us to engraft on our legislation those broad and comprehensive views which I hope will find favour with my brother senators. The use of the phrase " a territory " in the motion seems to imply that we are thinking of the territories of the United States, which, I presume, under their Constitution, have certain constitutional rights. It has yet to be considered - and a very great question it is - what constitutional rights, if any, we shall give, in the first instance, to these 350,000 black people and 500 white people. I prefer the words " part of the territory of the Commonwealth," to the words " a territory." </para>

                    <para>- Important though this subject is, I do not wish to prolong the debate ; and I rise simply to point out a departure in the drawing of this motion from the method usually adopted in this Chamber. In each of the paragraphs of the motion the word " House " is used. In other motions proposed in this Chamber we have always referred to " the Senate." There are, I think, four notices of motion upon the business paper at the present time, and the word " House " is not used in either of them. The word " Senate " is always used. I suppose the word " House " is used here because the motion is copied from the resolution passed last night by the House of Representatives. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think the committee should hurriedly agree to this amendment. When this Bill left this Chamber we decided clearly that the question of costs in all of these cases should be left to the Judge presiding, and that is in accordance with the ordinary rule of every court of law. What is attempted here is to make some arbitrary distinction. Personally, I always view with considerable suspicion any attempt to fix a thing in an arbitrary way. The old argument might be adduced, that if one-third is right, possibly one-fourth or one-half would be right. As the clause left us, it was, in my opinion, completely satisfactory in leaving it to the Judge to decide whether costs should abide the verdict or not. Unless the Postmaster-General can give the committee some strong reason, and I cannot imagine any, why we should resort to this arbitrary rule, I intend to oppose the amendment, and I suggest that the committee should disagree to it. </para>

                        <para>- The clause as we sent it away provided that, unless the Judge otherwise directed, if the claimant received a sum equal to or less than the amount of the Government valuation, he would have to pay the costs. . This provides for a fixed rule with regard to a case where a claimant recovers very much less than the valuation and it fixes the amount at one-third. It is desirable that there should be some limit. It is a question for discussion whether one-third is the right amount to fix. The amendment really does not vary the clause, but it puts a limitation to the discretion of the Judge, so that where the amount recovered by the claimant is one-third less, he must pay the costs, and the Judge has no discretion to give the costs against the Crown, or to make an order that each side shall pay its costs. It is perfectly clear that the object of the amendment is to put a check on extravagant demands. </para>

                        <para>- In this case the Crown valuation is the amount offered to the claimant. Consequently it does not matter what is the standard of value. Take a property where the Crown valuation is £300. If the claimant likes to take that sum there is an end of the matter ; but if he says, " I think I can get more than £300," and goes to law, and the Court only awards him £200, he has to pay the costs. He goes to law at his own risk. He is offered, in the first instance, £300, for his property. It is his own fault if he goes to law, and thereby gets less than he was at first offered. This proposal puts a a certain amount of limitation on the discretion, of the Judge. The fixing of the amount at one-third is a matter for the committee to consider, but it appears to me that if there is no provision of the kind litigation will be encouraged by claimants hoping that they will get a great deal more than they were in the first instance offered by the Crown. </para>

                    <para>- I have had no experience in the other States, but in South Australia our experience has been that arbitrations always go against the Government. So far as the Government are concerned, arbitration has been found a most unsatisfactory way of settling disputes relating to the value of land. Originally we conducted all matters relating to the taking of land for railway purposes under the law of England, known as the Land Clauses Consolidation Act, and there was power to decide the question by arbitration or to go to the Supreme Court. So badly was the Government hit, however, that we found it necessary to bring in a special Bill to prevent arbitration in the future. "We provided with satisfactory results, not only to the Government, but also to the fair claimant, that a Judge of the Supreme Court should try these cases. "We did not give the right for a jury to try them, because we found that when a question went before a jury, they were unanimously against the Government. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that he has the option of going to arbitration, he cannot complain if the conditions with regard to costs are more severe than if he went to the court. He can go to the court, whether the amount is above or below £1,000, but if the amount is above £1,000, he must go to the court, and being compelled to go in that case, it is right that his interest should be carefully considered with regard to costs. I think the provisions with regard to costs here is entirely consistent with the other amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I shall oppose the amendment for the reasons mentioned by Senators Playford and Keating. Prom my own experience, I can indorse and confirm almost the whole of what has been said by those honorable senators. If the Crown, or a railway company, tries to do what is fair in taking land, the claimant tries to get an arbitrator, or an umpire, who will bolster up the value of the land, and secure to him an over-valuation of his property. Apart from that, I think- the amendment spoils the symmetry of the Bill. The </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry to say I shall have to support the Government in this matter. At the same time I am going to give them the benefit of the objection I take to the phraseology of the clause. I think that the effort being made throughout this Bill to effect the determination of the rights of the parties by hanging the question of costs over their heads, is entirely contrary to the spirit in which costs are given to either party. The true history of costs is really very simple. Whoever goes wrongfully to invoke the assistance of a tribunal has to pay the costs. I therefore objected to any arbitrary figure in the case of the prior amendment, because I thought the matter should be determined in the ordinary way. But we are told here that the costs of and incident to the arbitration, as settled by the arbitrators, must be borne by the Minister, unless the sum awarded by the arbitrator is the same or a less sum than was offered by the Minister, in which case each party is to bear his own costs incidental to the arbitration. What are the costs incidental to the arbitration ? If the draftsmen of this clause had ever been in court themselves, and if they understood or appreciated the interests of lawyers, they would see that in this fine discrimination they are making they are only establishing a fruitful source of litigation and piling up costs, which is the very thing they should desire to avoid. Then we are told that the costs of the arbitrators should be borne by the parties in equal proportions. Under some circumstances each party is to pay his own costs, under other circumstances the Government is to pay the whole costs, and under other circumstances the claimant is to pay them himself. Why not make a simple ordinary rule putting the two suggested amendments together? Where the amount is less than £1,000 the person might have the option of arbitration. If the arbitrator finds for less than the valuation he should pay the costs. If it is more than £1,000 he must go direct to the court, and if the court finds for less than the amount offered he must pay the costs, and in both cases a discretion might be given to the Judge or the arbitrator to vary this rule for special circumstances. Surely that would be a simple way of dealing with it. But this long-winded verbose " tiddlywinking " phraseology will lead to endless complications, and instead of preventing persons going to court it may make them say " our claim may be no good, but we will box up the costs in some way and make something out of them." I most reluctantly support the Government, because at all events the two clauses are very consistent in being so opposed to the ordinary rational rule as to costs. </para>

                        <para>- There is not a large number of honorable senators who will say that. You can have lawyers in an arbitration case, but you are not bound to have them. This clause is really in the interests of the smaller man, to whom the valuation of his property is probably a great deal more than it is to a wealthy man, from whom £10,000 or £20,000 worth is taken; and he ought to be given the fullest possible facility of getting a determination arrived at on his claim, in whatever court he may think fit to approach. If it will suit him to go to the High Court, he will not attempt to go to arbitration; but if he desires that it should be referred to arbitration, by all means let him have the power to go. Sub-clause (2) is the provision which would probably be availed of by persons who desired to have their cases dealt with by arbitration. A District or County Court Judge, a police stipendiary, or special magistrate are the men who, by reason of their positions, in nine cases out of ten, would be employed by the parties to a dispute. The Minister would be prepared to accept one of these men at any time, and the probability is that nine men out of ten would say - " We shall have this matter settled by a District Court Judge, or a police magistrate, and we believe that we can get it settled expeditiously and cheaply. It is my intention to support the Government in regard to this clause, because I honestly believe that it is the best course in the interests of the smaller man, who can least afford to pay for expensive litigation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think there need be very much fear that the Minister will not make a fair choice. If the claimant cannot agree to that, then he must do without his money till he can. Probably the Minister would name two or three men, and give the claimant his choice of any one of them for appointment as arbitrator. Except in some extraordinary circumstances, it is not likely that a Minister of the Crown would do anything unfair in a matter of this kind. The money does not come out of his pocket, or it might be different. We may be quite sure that he will act fairly and honestly as between the parties, leaning as he should do towards the claimant, where the land has been taken compulsorily. If the Minister will not accept the amendment I have suggested, I shall have to vote against the amendment made by another place. </para>

                        <para>- I think I was right in saying that this amendment is consequential upon the last, because the difficulty that became apparent in the discussion of the Bill was as to how we should deal with the transferred property taken over under section 85 of the Constitution, and supposed to be worth some £10,000,000 or more. A conference has taken place between the Premiers, and at their request the whole matter has been postponed for further consideration. We still have a Bill which is urgently required, because we have no provision at the present time for acquiring land which may be necessary for public purposes. In connexion with the Post and Telegraph department, for instance, sites are required in a number of States for Post-offices, and we have no means whatever of acquiring land for the purpose. We ask to be supplied with that means by this Bill, and we take out of the Bill all reference to the transferred property. The amendment with which we are now dealing, simply says that the provisions of the Bill shall not apply to the property transferred under section 85 of the Constitution. It is, of course, a matter which must be dealt with by agreement with the Premiers of the States, and we have consented to leave it open for further consideration. In the meantime, however, we require the Bill to be passed into law in order that we may have the power of acquiring property where it may be necessary for Commonwealth purposes. </para>

                    <para>- I do not regard this amendment as consequential upon the omission of clause 45 . Still I think there is a fair contention put forward on the part of the Government for the insertion of a provision of this character, as I take it, the Government, of the Commonwealth are by no means satisfied to have the mode of payments specified in clause 44 applied to any lands vested in them by virtue of section 85 of the Constitution. Having had a conference with the Premiers of the various States, and finding that they were strongly opposed to the provisions of clauses 45 and 47, they agreed, as I understand it, without giving up their own contention as to the desirability of such clauses being in the Bill, that the' properties transferred should be removed from the operation of this Bill entirely. If we had to deal with the question of payment for the transferred properties, so far as I can see at the present time, I should be prepared to give my adhesion to the mode provided for in clause 44. The Government having seen fit to propose compensation under the provisions of clauses 45 and 47, an entirely different mode of payment, I think it is a matter of expediency that we should leave these transferred properties absolutely excluded from the operation of this Bill. </para>

                    <para>When any department of the public service of the State is transferred to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth shall compensate the State by the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section ; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be mode by The Parliament. </para>

                <para>First of all we wish to see if it is not possible to arrive at some agreement by means of which this compensation may be paid. It may be that it will have to be embodied in an Act of Parliament ultimately, and I assume that the Government would not attempt to lay down the rule under which compensation should be made, and pledge the State to payment of compensation without consulting Parliament. Taking the whole of the circumstances into consideration, I think the wise course to adopt is the course now proposed by the Government, and to allow the question of compensation for the transferred properties to take- the form of a special Act of Parliament, after ascertaining whether it is not possible to do it in such a way as will meet with the acceptance of the representatives of the individual States. </para>
