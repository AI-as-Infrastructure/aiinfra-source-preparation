                            <para>- If the words - "unless the contrary be proved " are not inserted in this clause, it may make the principal responsible for declarations made by persons who are not authorized to make them. It is rather serious to hold a man responsible for a declaration made without his knowledge or consent, although it may have been made by his agent. I suggest, therefore, that after the word " held " the words " unless the contrary be proved " be inserted. This would throw the onus of proof that the declaration was made without the knowledge or consent of the principal, upon him. The principal would still be liable unless it was shown that the declaration was made without his knowledge and consent. </para>

                            <para>- I think the committee will see that it is necessary that the clause should remain as it is if they reflect what the position really is. In the ordinary transaction of Customs business, for the convenience of the owner of goods, an agent or employe is' allowed, to make declarations and do a variety of things which it would be impossible for the owner of the goods to do himself. Honorable senators who are aware of the multiplicity of detailed transactions that have to be gone through in Customs business know that it would be impossible for any owner of goods in a large way to attend personally to matters at the Custom-house. Therefore, he sends a duly credited agent or employe, or engages an ordinary Customhouse agent to do these things for him. In the course of business the agent or employe1 perhaps makes a certain declaration. It is quite obvious that if after a declaration had been made the owner were to be allowed to escape the consequences of that declaration by showing that it was not authorized, we should be opening the door to a tremendous amount of evasion of Custom-house regulations, and it would be quite impossible to secure the collection of the revenue. When a false declaration was made, the owner would be able to say - " There has been a mistake ; I know nothing about it. I have a thousand affairs to attend to, and this is only one of them, and my agent has made the wrong declaration under a misapprehension." There is no hardship in making the principal Liable for what his agent declares. What has been done is for 'the benefit of the principal, and is done in the ordinary course of business. The clause will have the effect of making owners liable for what is done by the agents they employ to act for them. </para>

                                <para>- The ordinary law of principal and agent applies to this case as to any other. If a man is an agent, appointed for particular duties or a particular purpose, and goes outside his employment with regard to such action, he is not an agent. The use of the words " any agent " perfectly safeguards the employer, because it must be shown that the person making the declaration is an agent, and he must, of course, be an agent authorized expressly or impliedly. I want to protect the Customs against the possibility of confusion arising from the use of the words " the agent," under which it might be argued that there could be only one agent lawfully authorized. I have consented to an amendment omitting the words " employe or," because they are implied by reference to clause 173, but I cannot go any further than that. </para>

                                <para>- I will refer to that in a moment. Clause 175 refers to the liability of persons appointed as agents for any infringements of the law they may make in the name of the principal. They are to be liable just as if they were the principals themselves. Then clause 176 is necessary for the protection of the Customs, to make sure that the principal is also liable. But he ought to be liable only for the act of an agent so lawfully authorized, that is to say, " the agent." Then I am asked, what are we to do in the case of two or three agents if we use the words "the agent." We have just dealt with an Acts Interpretation Bill, under which words used in the singular are to be interpreted to apply equally in , the plural, and that will get over that difficulty altogether. </para>

It may be two or three agents, or only one ; but if we say " the agent " we shall be referring to the agents indicated by by clauses 173, 174, and 175, and shall have homogenous and uniform legislation upon the subject. It is clear to me that there must have been some other object in the use of the word "employe," and we want only to refer to the agent defined by the previous clauses. </para>

                            <para>- I think there is very little in the discussion. " Any agent " means any agent authorized as aforesaid, and I feel confident that no court, construing the Bill, would ever say that " any agent " in this clause meant any other class of agent -than that referred to in clause 173. What 'difference does it make to the Minister to use the words " the agent " when they will have the same force as "any agent?" If two or- more are employed, the Acts Interpretation Bill, as has been pointed out, will enable us to catch all of them. </para>

I have very little doubt, as a lawyer, that " any " used in this clause would be construed to mean, any agent appointed " under the previous clause, and to use the word " the " would, in my opinion, put. the clause in a more satisfactory way. </para>

                                <para>- No; but what honorable senators want is that there should be responsibility only in the case of an agent appointed in a particular way' under clause 173. It ought not to be limited in that way. If the Custom-house, for its own purposes, choose to allow the owner to act under clause 173, an agency is created in that way. But if in some other way, perhaps not complying with that clause, a principal, chooses to send a person to make a declaration for him, so as to get the benefit of it, why should he not be responsible for it also? I cannot understand the object in trying to protect a man from the act of his own agent. I consented to the omission of the word "employe" because there might be some doubt whether it might not mean any employe, whether authorized or not ; but now that it is quite clear that the person who makes the declaration . must be the agent - that is, the person authorized - what does it matter whether he is authorized under clause 173 or in any other way? </para>

There may be cases of prohibited goods, in respect to which lie does not want to make himself liable, and he does not send an agent to make himself liable. What is the Custom-house to do in those circumstances ? Is it not to open the goods ? Under ordinary circumstances I admit that the owner or the agent is present, and we may be well assured that the Customs authorities will take care that the owner or the agent is always there when the goods are opened. That is the ordinary practice, and I want this power to provide for an extraordinary case. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to draw the attention of the committee to the use of the word " officer " in the clause without any limitation or statement as to his position. Under the interpretation clause the word " officer" includes all persons employed in the service of the Customs. Therefore, any Customs employe, male or female, can do anything which it is put in the power of any officer to do under this clause. I make these remarks in order that the committee may see its way later on to have a proper definition of the term " officer." </para>

                            <para>- I see no objection to the withdrawal of the amendment if the "Vice-President of the Executive Council is so anxious to stick to the wording of the Bill, but I would point out that the clause says that if any officer of Customs shall have reasonable cause to suspect, certain consequences shall ensue, and then goes on to say that instead of the consequences following, the officer "may" detain and search the suspect. It seems to me to be utterly absurd in framing a Bill which is being put forth as an effort of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia that we should allow a clause worded as this is to pass.However, it is only a question of a verbal alteration. The result will be the same, so far as the purpose of the clause is concerned, whether the amendment is agreed to or not. I shall not, therefore, press the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator will see that under clause 219 a ship becomes forfeited for a variety of causes. A ship used in smuggling, for instance, may be forfeited. When the things happen that are indicated in that clause, the ship becomes forfeited. Then the clause before the committee provides that any officer may seize any forfeited ship or any goods which he has reasonable cause to believe are forfeited. That is to say, if the Offence which forfeits a ship or goods has been clearly committed, the officer may seize them as forfeited goods. If he has a reasonable cause to suspect that the offence has been committed, he seizes the goods. If there were not this power, the power of forfeiture would be of no use, since there is not much use in being able to forfeit a ship unless there is also power to prevent her from sailing away. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection whatever to the first part of the clause, but it seems to me that to permit an officer to seize a ship which it is reasonable to believe may be forfeited, is going a bit too far. The forfeiture of a ship is an action to be taken after certain preliminaries have been observed. It is not a question of suspicion, but of facts. There is no reason why we should empower an officer to seize a ship merely because he has reason to suspect that" something has been done. The fact should be capable of demonstration. I submit that the last part of the clause might very well come out, unless there is a reason, which I cannot divine, why it should remain. </para>

                                <para>- No ; the offence would have to be proved afterwards. The mere fact that the thing has been done would enable the ship or the goods to be forfeited. We are giving this power to an officer, so that if he has reasonable ground to believe that certain goods have been smuggled, he may seize them. If a seizure is made, the officer must justify his conduct on the grounds that there has been smuggling, or that some other offence has been committed. Or if there is reasonable cause to believe that there has been smuggling, the officer has to act to the best of his judgment and seize the goods. If it should turn out afterwards that there has been smuggling, the officer is justified in his action, and if he has had reasonable cause to suspect, it is right to give him the power conferred by this clause. Under these circumstances we require to have both powers : in the same way as it is necessary to give a constable power to arrest if an offence is committed in his presence, or where he has a suspicion that a felony has been committed. We could never get officers to act unless we protected them in this way. </para>

Although it is very important to the persons concerned,still, after the forfeiture has once taken place, and there is the right of sale, the carrying out of the sale is a simple matter enough ; and I presume that all that will be necessary will be that the sale shall take place under such circumstances as will secure the best value for the Government. Any one who knows anything of the working of Customs Acts will bear me out that, in these days, when the old style of smuggling has disappeared, the forfeiture of a ship is a thing that very seldom takes place. It is, however, necessary that we should retain the power. </para>

                                <para>- This is one of those matters in which we must give a large power to be exercised at the discretion of an officer when it is necessary. In the case which my honorable colleague put, unless the officer has the power of immediate arrest, it will be impossible for him to sheet home the offence against the lascar who has smuggled . cigars in his possession. In the Crimes Act of New South Wales power is given to a policeman to arrest without warrant, and why should not that power be given to a Customs officer to be exercised in cases where he has reasonable cause to believe that offences have been committed against the Customs Act? If honorable senators will look at the next clause they will see that the power is carefully safeguarded. It provides that on demand the officer must give a statement in writing of the' reasons for which the arrest is made, and, therefore, there is not the slightest probability that it will be exercised lightly, or in any case except where it is absolutely necessary. It has been admitted by honorable senators that there are cases in which it is desirable that such a power should be given. Unless it can be shown how it can be given to apply in those cases where honorable senators think it would be justifiable without making it generally applicable, a case has been made out for the clause as it </para>

                            <para>- The difficulty would be got over if the Government would accept the section of the Victorian Act. I understand it refers to the more serious offences that may be committed. We could get over the difficulty by specifying the offences which must be committed before power is given to an officer to arrest a man. What we want is to prevent a man being arrested "for any trumpery offence. Under this clause a man may be taken before a justice of the peace, who then has two courses open to him. Either he may send him to gaol or he may admit him to bail. Even if the man has committed only such an offence as failing to bring his ship to for boarding, or has not brought his ship to the mooring place as quickly as possible, he may be arrested. Again, a man may be. arrested because he has not arranged his goods properly, or has not paid certain dues, or has not provided sufficient lights, or has not provided proper accommodation for the Customs officer. </para>

                            <para>- I certainly was unware, when we began the discussion of this Bill, that it was intended by some clauses in it to repeal the provisions of Magna Charta, the Habeas Corpus Act, and every other foundation of British liberty, for the purpose of protecting the Customs, but that is exactly what this clause does. For the purpose of Customs administration it enables any officer of the Customs or any member of the police force to arrest, not anybody who has been guilty, but anybody whom the officer may suspect to have been guilty of an offence under the Customs Act. A more monstrous and Draconian provision was never inserted in any Act of Parliament. I would give the Customs all reasonable power for the prevention of smuggling, but I would not give them power to arrest any person coming as a passenger of a ship. A Customs officer might arrest a person whom he did not like or who might not give a satisfactory answer to questions put to him. I agree that there should be stringent provisions for the prevention of smuggling, but this clause goes altogether too far. If we are to repeal Magna Charta let us do it, but do not let us introduce such a proposal by a sort of side wind for the purpose of making stringent the Customs Act. To sweep away, by a clause such as this, the foundation upon which the immunity of persons from arrest now stands, is an infringement of the rights of the subject, lt seems to me that clause 188, which contains the powers given by the "Victorian Act, is sufficient. If it were necessary to enlarge that provision no one would object,, because we are all agreed that every possible power must be put in the hands of the Customs authorities to safeguard the revenue. But it should not be within the option of a Customs officer to exercise such powers of arrest as are proposed to be given. </para>

I hope they will see their way either to adopt the Victorian section or to limit the clause in the way that has been suggested by defining the offences for which arrest may take place, or by confining it to smuggling. If one .of these courses were adopted, the difficulty would be overcome. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite admit that this power would never be exercised except in serious cases ; but they object to have such large powers, left for possible application to trivial offences. Inasmuch as it was never intended that the clause should apply to trivial offences, and as it would be absolutely of no value as applied to trivial offences, I have no objection to amending the clause in the form in which we really wish to have the power exercised - that is, for preventing smuggling. We do not desire anything more than that. It must be remembered that the clause will' be exercised by responsible officers, under proper official control. But, inasmuch as the Government will secure all the power they require for the protection of the revenue by making the amendment suggested, we may save time if I state at once that I am going to consent to it. Therefore, 'if the honorable senator will pardon the application of the American story to himself," though I do not wish to deprive the committee of the pleasure of hearing his "speech, I hope he will reserve it for another occasion. It will be found that the word "smuggling" is defined in the interpretation clause in this way- </para>

                            <para>- While this clause was being discussed, I wrote the word " smuggling " on the margin of my Bill, thinking that that would meet the wishes of honorable senators; but when. I came to look back to clause 1 88,I thought that that clause would cover it, and that there is therefore no necessity for this clause at all. I feel even now that there is no necessity for this clause, if it is intended that smuggling only shall be dealt with under it, because that is already dealt with under clause 188. I agree with the arguments advanced in opposition to the insertion of the words " contrary to the provisions of the Act," because that would seem to imply that people may smuggle if they can do so in accordance with the provisions of the Act. </para>

                                <para>- At any rate, the words "on demand" should be struck out. In the typical case of the lascar, I do not think we could attribute to the person arrested the knowledge that he could make a demand for a written statement of the reason for his arrest, and probably 999 persons out of 1,000, if so many were arrested, would not know that it was necessary to make this demand. It is only fair that at the earliest possible moment the person who is arrested should have an authoritative statement in writing of the reason for his arrest. I move - </para>

Is that the sort of legislation we want ? </para>

                                <para>- What is the value of the provision unless it can be enforced? However, as there seems to be a strong objection to putting a penalty on a Customs officer under any circumstances, we might allow this matter to pass, now that the provision under which a man can be arrested is for smuggling alone. He would know at once that he had been so arrested. That being the case, and as there is such a strong objection to the amendment, the honorable senator will perhaps consent not to press it, but will leave it to the officer to do his duty. If he fails in this respect, he should suffer a more severe penalty than a mere reprimand. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the amendment will be withdrawn, because it is an attempt to put into the Customs Bill what should be in the Public Service Bill. If any servants of the Commonwealth neglect their duty, we can provide a remedy in the Public Service Bill. That is the measure in which to impose penalties for lapses of duty. </para>

The clause is very drastic, but that is absolutely necessary in order to protect the Customs. I am not quite sure whether the words " all books and documents " go quite far enough. The interpretation clause simply says that " documents include books." Does the .word cover correspondence and telegrams? </para>

The principal Custom-house officials will have a very large number of officers under them. A person may come into court with a complaint that upon a certain day, so many months ago, he was improperly treated by a Customs officer. Where? notice is giving in writing, the Custom-house officials get an opportunity to make inquiries, and to find out the particular officer who was in charge on the occasion, referred to in the complaint. They are able to find out all the circumstances, and direct their proof to meet the case brought against them. A complaint may be made that on a certain day something took place, but months afterwards it may be impossible to identify the particular transaction,' and to ascertain whether a particular officer was in charge at the time or not ; but this proposal would place it in the. hands of any plaintiff to bring forward a claim when it would be impossible for the department to bring evidence to meet it. </para>

It is very necessary in such cases that notice should be provided for so that the Custom-house officials may have an opportunity to make necessary inquiries. The clause as it stands puts the department and the plaintiff in what is simply a fair position, and it is better to have the rights of the parties settled definitely once and for all. If the law is not complied with, the verdict should be with the defendant, and if it has been complied with the case for the plaintiff can go on on its merits. To adopt the amendment suggested might compel the Government or the officer complained of to prefer to pay an unjust claim to taking up time with it any longer. </para>

                                <para>- No ; my proposal is only to enable an action to be proceeded with, notwithstanding that notice has not been given. An action may have been commenced within the six months, and it may turn out that no notice, or no notice conformable to the Act, has been given. Then the Judge cam say, "Here is a clear mistake," and he may allow the action to proceed, notwithstanding that the proper notice has not been given. If the Judge considers that there is a reasonable excuse for such want of notice, the proposal leaves it absolutely within his power to dispense with it. We can surely trust a Judge of the High Court with a power like this. I am convinced that no Judge would allow the notice required by statute to be dispensed with unless he was satisfied that there were very strong reasons to justify the waiving of the notice. </para>

                                <para>- No. If it could be shown to the court that a man had slept on his rights for five months, the Judge would not grant the order. In an enormous territory like ours there must be Customs officers here, there, and everywhere in remote parts, and it may be a long time before the man can communicate with the centre and obtain' advice, so that it is only reasonable to give a wide margin in the event of any mistake happening. If the Government like to say that they will extend the time to twelve months, the reason for this proposal would be removed at once. This power could only be brought into force in the event of the Judge being satisfied that a man had not slept on his rights. </para>

                                <para>- I must oppose this amendment, and I shall give my reasons- very shortly. What is the object of these clauses with which we are now dealing? It is. to protect the officer who has the administration of the measure. The officer is carrying out his duties day by day, dealing with hundreds of cases and. hundreds of persons, probably, in a busy place. Why do we want to protect the officer, and why do we treat him in a different way from that in which we treat an ordinary individual ? For the reason that he lias a multiplicity of transactions with the public, and deals with an enormous number of persona -in the course of a day : and, if his attention is not directed ' to the circumstances immediately after the event, it is very likely that he may not be able to meet the charges made against him. lt can be easily understood that if we definitely lay down in this Bill that there shall be six. months' notice of any action, the officer will know what he is about; but, if this provision is added, it means that the case may be. brought up some considerable time afterwards, when the whole of the circumstances may have gone out of the officer's memory. In other words, this proviso means; that instead of settling the rights of the parties definitely in the Statute, we shall leave it to the Judge to decide whether there ought or ought not to be a notice. If this is done .we simply fritter away the protection given by the Bill for the purpose of enabling officers to do their duty. The officers have no interest in the matter except to do their duty. They make no profit out of it. If' an officer in doing his duty knows that if a complaint is to be made against him it must be made within six months,. and that there* must be definite- notice of what the complaint -is, and that the- action can only be on that cause of complaint, his position is well defined. But if this proviso is allowed to stand, a person cao. bring his action many months afterwards -without giving notice at all, because the person making, the complaint can go to the court, for an extension of time. That means a multiplication of legal proceedings, and enables persons to sleep on their rights, instead of looking. into, the -law and understanding what their rights are, and acting accordingly. The Employers' Liability Act is quoted in justification of this proposal. </para>

I have quoted this case as an instance in which it was recognised by the Chief Justice and by the jury that justice was on the side of the plaintiffs, and yet they lost the case because of the delay of a day which occurred in consequence of protracted negotiations between the traders on the one side and the Ministry on the other. </para>

If that protection is not given, the clause ought to be altered. </para>

                        <para>Commonwealth Act is to establish a uniform Tariff ; but what we shall have to do in the first instance is to establish, by Act of authority, a uniform Tariff. A Tariff will have to be brought down which will ultimately be uniform, but in the meantime its incidence will be the enforcing of the highest Tariff in each one of the States. I have, therefore, taken the view throughout that it matters very little whether the clause be carried or not ; because, without being in the confidence of the Government, or knowing their views, I think it absolutely necessary for the prevention of fraud on the new Tariff, to have an act of authority which it will be absolutely impossible for us to legislatively provide for, but which it will be quite possible for us to subsequently ratify. I think the clause is some protection, and all the protection we can give, and I support it for what it is worth. </para>

                            <para>- We can readily understand the object of the Government in inserting the clause. We cannot blind our eyes to the fact that we shall be put in the position of having a Tariff that is not uniform ; but, whether it will be necessary to collect both State and Commonwealth Tariffs, is another question. On that there seems a difference of opinion, but we can readily forecast what the Government will do under, a provision of that character. They will collect on the proposed Tariff where that is the higher of the two," and where the State Tariff is the higher, they will collect the State Tariff under the State laws as they exist to-day, and, no doubt, when the Tariff has been finally dealt with, will refund any moneys over-collected. We must recognise the fact that we shall be labouring under the same trouble as now, that of the Inter-State duties, which we want to see abolished as early as possible. </para>

The Government will collect duties on the borders of the States, as well as on the borders of the Commonwealth. The clause proposes that nothing shall be done until after the close of the session, but we have no assurance as to how long the session is going to last. We are required to have a session each year, but I was member of a Legislature in which a session lasted 13 months. We must bear in mind, therefore, that we are possibly suspending a person's cause of action for some indefinite period. I admit at once that there is a necessity for doing something, and I am not prepared to propose anything more satisfactory than the course suggested by the Government. But I want the committee to realize what the effect will be if they pass the clause as it stands. </para>

                                <para>- I have no doubt whatever that this clause will give all the necessary protection. The clause has been considered with exceeding care. As honorable senators no doubt are aware, Other methods were suggested at first of dealing with thisquestion,andfinally, after a great deal of consideration, this has been determined upon as the best method of getting over the difficulty that must arise in dealing with the uniform Tariff. It will be observed that the protection is for anything done in the collection of the revenue in respect of "any Tariff or Tariff alterations." Even if it is proposed to collect the State duty where it is highest, or the uniform duty where that is highest, this clause clearly protects the Customs officers. The proposal simply means that it being necessary to do certain things for the collection of the revenue, what is done for that purpose is protected. I can assure honorable senators that this clause, in the opinion of the Government, will carry out the object we aim at. </para>

The best legal opinion has been taken upon it, and that opinion is that the clause will not fully carry out what is intended. I do not think there can be any doubt that for a time two duties will have to be collected, namely, the existing duties, which we may call the State duties, and the duties under the Tariff brought in by the Commonwealth Government. The proposal I have to submit to the Minister, as the result of a legal opinion which has been taken, is that the clause should be slightly altered, so as to read as follows : - </para>

                                <para>- I understand that the objection is-that while the protection is given to the officer for collecting under a Tariff which is not yet altered by law, no. protection is given to him for the collection of duty under a Tariff under existing Acts. Well, it is absolutely unnecessary to give the officer any such protection. I will assume that there goes on the collection of a uniform Tariff which is not yet authorized by law. The officer wants protection for that. Suppose, at the same time, that there goes on in certain cases the collection of duties under the existing Tariffs. That is legal. The existing Tariff Acts are not repealed, and the Commonwealth is now collecting duties under them, and will be collecting duties under them until they are expressly or impliedly repealed. The mere fact of collecting duties upon some other basis, which may be in addition to these, and which are not authorized by law, does not render illegal the collection of duties authorized by the existing Tariffs. I have not the slightest doubt that that is the position, and for that reason we have found it necessary to provide for the protection of the officers with respect to what they do in the collection of duties imposed by the Tariff which is not yet authorized by Parliament. With regard to anything "done under existing statutes, no such protection is needed. With regard to the question of collecting uniform duties at the same time as the State duties, does the collection of those duties render nugatory or invalid the existing Acts ? I have no doubt it does not, and therefore no protection is necessary in the collection of duties under existing Acts. Under the circumstances, I hope the committee will see that there is no need to go beyond what we have done already to secure the protection of the officers. As to what the protection of the officers is, we have not taken away the right of action against an officer ; we have only postponed it under certain conditions. If the party who makes the complaint thinks fit, he may make an application foi1 security against the officer, and if the officer does not give security, the action may go on at once. If the officer does give security, the action is postponed until after the end of the session in which the Tariff is proposed. I have thought it well to state my view, and it is the view of the Government, that the -protection here given to the officer is ample. </para>

Their desire is the same as ours, to afford protection to the officer in the collection of duties under a uniform Tariff or any alteration of the Tariff, not necessarily in this session of the Commonwealth Parliament, but in any session of the Commonwealth Parliament. If the Government are satisfied that this clause, as framed, will carry that into effect, I think my honorable friends may be satisfied to let it rest there. As it is, the clause is enormously extensive. It says - </para>

                            <para>- I point out that what happened in New South Wales might form a reason why the words "or otherwise " should be put in. In New South Wales the court was applied to for a mandamus compelling the Collector of Customs to give up goods without any duty, and the court refused to exercise its discretion, leaning in the direction of protecting the revenue. I think, therefore, the clause is quite right in dealing with any proceeding by action " or otherwise," which may include such a mandamus. With regard to the remarks of </para>

                        <para>Senators Clemons and Sargood, I always understood that the difficulty was that, the moment the Federal Tariff was laid upon the table, although at nine o'clock the following morning we might begin to collect the duties imposed by virtue of an Executive minute, it would not be such an imposition as is mentioned in the Constitution Act, and therefore would not bring about Inter-State free-trade. It is because that would not be legal imposition of duty that we need the clause to protect the officers, for the Federal Tariff, being collected under those circumstances, would not, as we all admit, be a legal imposition of the Tariff. </para>

What I rose to say was that my honorable and learned friend must not assume that he is right in saying that everybody admits that the collection by Executive minute of the Tariff which may be imposed will not be an imposition of the Tariff within the meaning of our Constitution. I do not admit that it will not be such an imposition. On the contrary, there is a very great deal to be said in favour of the collection of the Tariff by Executive authority being held to be an imposition of the Tariff for the purposes of our Constitution, so as to enable Inter-State free-trade to come simultaneously into operation. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to propose certain amendments, which will bring the clause more into agreement with the provisions in the English law. In England an Act was passed in 1890, which very considerably mitigated the harshness of the forfeiture provisions. When this Bill was in the other House the Minister of Trade and Customs expressed his intention of putting in some provisions in accordance with the English Act, but he did not do so. That Act made very important alterations. In the first place,, it limited total forfeiture to vessels of under 250 tons burden; and then with regard to offences connected with ships exceeding 250 tons burden, the penalty was limited to a fine of £50, with power, if the commissioners were not satisfied that it was an adequate penalty, to bring the ship into court with a view to a fine of not exceeding £500 being inflicted. </para>

The power exists in England and in all the States. It is quite true that it is not very often exercised, but when it has to be exercised, it does seem to me that it is just as fairly exercisable in regard to a ship of 500 tons or 1,000 tons, as it is in regard to a ship of 250 tons. </para>

                        <para>It is obvious that on a large boat it will be practically impossible for the owners to make it quite certain that some felonious person on board shall not commit the offences laid down in the Bill, while, in the case of a small boat of 250 tons register and under, it is obvious to all of us that the owner or master would be much more in control of the boat and of every one on her. I can quite understand why the distinction has been drawn. It has been held in a rough sort of way that in the case of a boat of small tonnage the owner or master ought to be held to be in entire control of what is going on. But when you get to a boat of 10,000 tens, it seems to me a monstrous tiling that there should be forfeiture, at any rate, for an offence under sub-clause (4). If the clause were enforced literally, with all the powers it contains, it would be possible to forfeit to His Majesty a boat of 10,000 tons worth £500,000, because some passenger, or if you like some of the crew, threw some goods overboard to prevent seizure by the Customs. A power of this sort seems to be monstrous. I cannot see that you have any right to impose a penalty of £500,000 because that happens. Yet the clause provides for a penalty of at least £500,000. There are plenty of ships whose value can easily be assessed at such a sum, and if an offence is committed by somebody on board over whom, perhaps, neither the captain nor any officer has any immediate control, to mulct the owner in a penalty of that sort seems to me an utterly preposterous proceeding. If there was no other provision to object to, I should offer the most strenuous objection I could to sub-clause (4). </para>

                                <para>- My honorable friend goes much beyond that. The scheme of the clause is that it provides that certain ships which are used in certain ways shall be forfeited to His Majesty. The governing words at the beginning of the clause, which the honorable senator wishes to amend, apply to the whole of the six paragraphs. The English Act only applies to one, namely, paragraph 4. As to that, the English Act provides that no ship shall be liable to be forfeited on account of goods being thrown overboard unless such ship shall be of not more than 250 tons burden. I am quite willing to consent to an amendment limiting paragraph 4, so that any ship of not more than 200 tons reputed tonnage may be forfeited. The reason for that, as pointed out by </para>

According to SenatorClemons' argument, if a man were a blackguard, as long he was eighteen or twenty stone in weight it would be all right, but if he were a seven or eight stone blackguard he should be punished as heavily as possible. </para>

                        <para>SenatorMcGREG OR. - It is neither greater nor less. If any vessel is to be forfeited for one of the offences mentioned, in this clause, the principle should apply all round. As far as I am concerned my vote will always go to give the same leniency tattle big rogue as the little one, and if a small vessel is to be forfeited for one of these offences the same punishment should be meted out to a large vessel. A vessel of 10,000 tons has ten times the capacity for fraud as a vessel of a thousand tons, and certainly ought to be under the same liability. I hope the Vice-President of the Executive Council will stick to the clause as it stands. </para>

                                <para>- If we are to act upon the principle that a man should be punished according to the enormity of his offence, it should apply when we are dealing with the forfeiture of ships. The forfeiture of a ship worth £100,000 is a very much more severe penalty than the forfeiture of a, ship worth only £1,000. </para>

                        <para>SenatorPULSFORD (New South Wales). - -I should be quite satisfied if I understood that the clause would be made to agree substantially with the existing law of the United Kingdom. That would satisfy me. I do not say that our provision should be exactly the same as the English section, but it should be substantially like. </para>

                                <para>-Iam quite willing to make an amendment bringing paragraph 4 into substantial agreement with the English law. I cannot accept the honorable senator's amendment, and I have given good reasons why. I am willing to accept an amendment of sub-clause (4) restricting the forfeiture to the case of a ship of not more than 250 tons, but I cannot go any. further than that. It would be hard upon the owners of a ship, whether large or small, to make them responsible for throwing over- board by passengers ; but in the case of a ship of the size stated, it is much more likely that the master or officers would be connected in an attempt to evade justice. That is an amendment which has been promised by ray honorable colleague in the other House. </para>

I do not think there is a very great deal of difference, but I tell the honorable senator now that it would not be the same. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose I must consent to the adjournment now, but I must point out that we are adjourning continually at a very early hour, and are getting through comparatively little work. I want to get the Bill finished this week. I have promised the recommittal of some clauses, and there are some new clauses to be proposed. The discussion upon the remaining clauses will take some time, and I would like to be in a position to have the whole of the Bill dealt with, subject to the final recommittal, by to-morrow night. If honorable senators will promise to assist me to do that, by sitting as late as may be necessary, and confining their speeches within as short a limit as possible, I shall have no objection to adjourning now-. I hope 1 may appeal to the Senate to so facilitate business that we may be able to get this Bill through, and sent do wai. to the other House this week. If it depended upon me entirely, this- Bill would' have been out of this House long ago, and I must ask my honorable friends opposite to help me in the conduct of public business by shortening, discussion us much as possible, and enabling us to deal finally with the Bill this week. Under the circumstances, I am willing that the Chairman should now report, progress. </para>
