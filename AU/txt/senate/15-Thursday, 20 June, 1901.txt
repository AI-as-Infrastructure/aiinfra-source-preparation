                        <para>-Col. NEILD. - I beg to ask the Postmaster-General, without notice, if he will lay on the table of the Senate tomorrow the proposed agreement between the Government of Victoria and the Commonwealth Government with reference to the occupancy of Parliament buildings, in which we are now met? I ask the question because I see that the proposed agreement has been laid before the State Houses of Parliament, and therefore I assume that it is available. </para>

                            <para>- If the contention of the Government is right, if they are right in including this item, the Senate can suggest an alteration. But what position does that put us in? Suppose we object 'to £10,000 being spent in New South Wales. We might strike out the item ; but then we should have to sacrifice the whole Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Or any other items. There is, I think, with regard to this item, a clear-cut distinction. I do not for one moment want to bring about any difficulty with the House of Representatives, but I do want to make clear what is the position of the senators representing the smaller States. I am certain that no one here desires to bring about a collision with the House of Representatives, but I think that in this Bill itself we have some evidence, slight though it may be, that the members of the House of Representatives are not quite prepared to give us that which we believe to be our rights. </para>

                            <para>- -Very .well, sir. Even in this Bill itself there is some evidence that we will require to assert ovir position. I hope that I am endeavouring to do so in a respectful way. I personally think that it is not necessary for us to ask the House of Representatives to give us any concession whatever. All that we are entitled to, all that we want, is our right as senators, and if we get that, then, whether we like it or not, whether it be consistent with our view of the law or not, we ought, and we must, be satisfied with it. I simply wish to place the view that I have formed in this matter before the Senate, and to suggest that, particularly to those smaller States, it is of very great importance indeed that the power over the purse, which, in a limited sense, the Senate lias been given, should be preserved to the utmost. </para>

                        <para>. - I must congratulate the honorable and learned senator upon the admirable way in which he has stated his case. I am very pleased that he has taken the course of fixing upon one particular item in this Bill. Of course it will be open for me, if I choose to do so, to fix upon any other item in the Bill and See how his argument 'will apply to it. I quite agree with the honorable and learned senator also that it is perfectly right that we in the Senate should see that the rights of this Chamber are always preserved. We have this advantage, I think, that having a written Constitution, those rights are absolutely fixed, and I think, therefore, that we cannot be placed at any disadvantage, even if on some occasion the exact line of demarcation between the rights of the two Chambers is not preserved, simply because it could not create a precedent, and would in no case bind either House on any future occasion. I will say this at the outset, that we should bear in mind in discussing this matter that the other branch ' of the Legislature has behaved, I think, very well towards this Chamber up to the present. We had a Bill sent up which, as was pointed out, was defective in some respects. That Bill was sent back to the other House with a respectful message. As soon as the defect was pointed out to the Government, they took steps to introduce another Bill. The House of .Representatives assented to that Bill at once, and sent it back to the Senate. </para>

                        took this ground, I think, that the ordinary annual service meant simply moneys appropriated for services which had already been sanctioned by Parliament. If that were so, we could not have any Appropriation Bill at all here yet, because as we are commencing the Commonwealth there is not a single item in the Bill that has been included in a Supply Bill before.

                            <para>- In the ordinary course there will be a certain sum appearing one year for a particular purpose, and in another year there will be an entirely different sum put down for quite a different purpose. These items at any rate constitute the expenditure required for carrying on the services of the Government, and if the rule were to hold good, that in every case an amount which was required for some particular service or an item that had not occurred before was to go down in a separate Bill, nearly all the amounts appearing in the Estimates with the exception of the salaries of the civil servants would have to be put in a separate Bill. Now, I think I can show by illustrations that the honorable senator's contention could not be realty upheld. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have shown, by reference to what takes place in Great Britain, what the exceptions are and what particular votes it would be necessary to have placed in separate Bills because they involve questions of policy. I contend, however, that these items which have been referred to here are required to carry on the Government, and I repeat that the amount is entirely irrelevant. If it is necessary to put an item of £40,000 in a separate Appropriation Bill we should have to put an item of £4 in a separate Bill if it came under the same rule. </para>

I., of Bryce's. book, honorable senators will find the statement I am about to read, and they will see that Chief Justice Marshall, though trained in the interpretation of statutes by those rigid technical rules to which I have referred, brought to bear upon the interpretation of the Constitution of tha United States of America, not only a. high degree of legal and judicial knowledge, but also the ripened judgment and wider capacity of the statesman. This is. what Bryce says - </para>

                        <para>The cases which will arise as to the construction of these general words cannot be foreseen till they do arise. When they do arise the generality of the words leaves open to the interpreting Judges a far wider field than is afforded by ordinary statutes, which, since they treat of one particular subject, contain enactments comparatively minute and precise. Hence, although the duty of a court is only to interpret, the considerations affecting interpretation are more numerous than in the case of ordinary statutes, more delicate, larger in their reach and scope. They sometimes need the exercise, not merely of legal acumen and judicial fairness, but of a comprehension of the nature and methods of government, which one does not demand from the European Judge, who walks in the narrow path traced for him by ordinary statutes. It is therefore hardly an exaggeration to say that the American Constitution, as it now stands, with mass of fringing decisions which explain it, is a far more complete and finished instrument than it was when it came fire-new from the hands of the Convention. It is not merely their work; but -the work of the Judges, and most of all of one man, the great Chief Justice Marshall. </para>

Now, I am of the opinion that the other place has no anxiety or desire whatever to encroach upon the rights of the Senate, and I am equally certain that the Senate has no desire or anxiety to . encroach upon the rights of the other Chamber. Therefore, we are placed in this position, that we are now struggling to ascertain exactly what our respective rights are, and whatever they are they certainly should be maintained. </para>

Well, now, I think it is most definitely laid down, as far as the .Constitution is concerned, that so far as public works and new works are concerned, we have the right of dealing with the Bills in a co-ordinate capacity with the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- Because the Constitution confines us to the ordinary annual services of the year, and the construction of new works would not come within the ordinary annual services. It was because of the great difficulty I felt in this matter that I intimated as I did to the Senate last week that there were some two or three items in this Supply Bill which certainly were on the border line. The two items which arrested my attention at once were the £10,000 for the opening of Parliament, and the £43,000 for the military display. </para>

I was exceedingly anxious on this point, because at this juncture we have to realize that -we are creating a precedent, and we cannot let items of an extraordinary nature pass at least without some comment, because, if we do, there will be a possibility of encroachments being made unwittingly upon our rights which may lead to greater and greater encroachments as appropriation 'Bills come up. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend will bear in mind what I have said ; that I urge that this Bill may be passed, but that as there are items in it arresting our attention, and as similar items will from time to time recur, we should have some common understanding with the other House as to what items might and might not be included in Bills of this character. I would .urge this upon the serious consideration of the Senate, because I am -sure it is -the individual desire of every honorable senator that we should avoid struggles. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend is always interesting and nice, but sometimes he is a little bit annoying. That is very seldom,' however, because the honorable senator is so agreeable in manner that one cannot be angry with him. No doubt under a very strict reading of the Constitution it may appear that there is perhaps a slight irregularity in dealing with this matter in the way proposed. No doubt if a huge amount of money was to be spent it might cause the Senate to make a suggestion, but we would not do so in trivial matters. </para>

                            <para>- The distinction there would be this. The building of an entirely new Parliament House would not be within the "ordinary annual services" any more than the building of a new private house would be within the annual upkeep of one's house. Such sums as are appropriate and necessary to keep up Parliament House, to beautify it a little, to do something with the object of seeing that the various offices in it are made comfortable, to build another office - all this would come within the category of the maintenance of Parliament, and therefore would be ordinary annual expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt that as long as we have our rights projected in print under this Constitution they cannot be destroyed by any precedent, but they can be seriously hampered, because a precedent will always be taken advantage of by those who know it is wrong, but who can turn it to their own ends, or by those who, being incapable, or not having the time or the energy to study the question, will accept that as right which has been done by their predecessors. If we, at the opening of our Parliament, neglect to scrupulously differentiate our position from that of the other House, it will be much more difficult for us to assert our rights hereafter. I think there is every excuse for us being captious and critical at this stage in everything we do. Remarks are floating about in the press - I know I should not have mentioned that - but remarks are going about that we are merely spoiling for a fight in the Senate. All those who have at heart the spirit of the Constitution must know, however, that if our federal union is to work smoothly at all it can only be done by making the two Houses run as nearly as possible abreast. Having regard to the way in which the Constitution is drafted, our only chance of coining up to our proper position side by side with the House of Representative is by taking advantage of every elastic element in the Constitution ' to stretch forward our rights. There are many such elastic elements, and, if we lose no opportunity of asserting what we believe to be our rights, we shall establish a group of precedents and customs such as are in the British constitution, that will, so far as the </para>

                            <para>- We are at the beginning of our career and we are anxious, especially those who are associated with the smaller States, to have our position clearly defined, particularly on financial matters. We can see, as has already been .pointed out, that in the other House the smaller States are completely out-numbered, and that this is the place where the powers and' privileges and rights of the States must be conserved. I think, therefore, that at this early stage we are entitled to discuss matters in such a way as to lead us to a fair and just consideration of our ' position. Now, I am very grateful to Senator Ewing for having raised this question,, and I think we ought to know at this stage what is understood by " the ordinary annual services of the Government." I understand the Government to be practically the executive committee of both Houses of Parliament, to whom we have delegated certain powers, and to whom we have given certain rights in connexion with the management and.con.trol of the various departments. In order to cany out their duties they must incur certain expenditure, which must recur annually. The services rendered will be annual services, and we need not enter into very serious discussion of these matters, because they may be disposed of as fair ordinary expenditure. The Government practically present to us a statement of what it costs them to manage the departments for the year in the ordinary way, including the payment of salaries and so forth and if we attempted to amend or alter their statements we should very materially interfere with the practical management of our executive committee, because the wages must be paid, as has been already agreed upon. But when it comes to a matter which is not usual - and the Government may, perhaps, for -some self-glorification incur a large expenditure - we should have that expenditure brought before us as a- separate item, and not have it included amongst the ordinary items that must be passed,-' so that we may pay our accounts as honest people. This special item may be one involving, a matter of policy, and we must have the right to challenge, or. even to refuse to pay, if we consider the expenditure has been unnecessarily incurred. Therefore it is quite clear that if this Senate is to have any control whatever over the expenditure, and the right to review any unusual items, they must be presented to us under special Bills, and not in the ordinary Supply or Appropriation BUI. In such. case we can deal with the actions of our executive committee; and can condemn them, or otherwise, according to the way in which we think they have conducted the affairs of1 the Commonwealth. Some honorable senator has suggested that practically a new post-office might be built, and the money expended set down as an item of ordinary annual expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. I quite agree with honorable senators who have stated that we are dealing now with a matter of principle, and not with the question of amount, because it does not matter whether the amount is a farthing- or £100,000. The question is whether we are right in contending that all things out of the ordinary way should be submitted to us under separate Appropriation- Bills, so that we may have an opportunity of expressing our opinion as to whether the expenditure has been justifiably incurred- or not. We do not desire to interfere with the expenditure necessary for the carrying on of what may be- termed our household, affairs, but we have a right to call the Government to account for- any extraordinary items of expenditure. I know it is said that this Senate cannot make or unmake Ministries, but we can take up such a position that we can compel them to retire unless they carry out the wishes of. this Senate, as well as those of the other House. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable and learned friend is quite right. As I- began by saying, one has only to think of one's own ordinary concerns. The frugal man maps out his expenditure, and desires to make it go as far as he can j but he always takes it as a matter of course that there will be other items that he cannot foresee but which will have to be taken into consideration. If we are going to assert our rights upon matters of this kind, I fancy we shall he likely to get into trouble. Let me give another example. We live under a Constitution at the head of which is a King. I hope that the King will come to see us some day or other. Could it be said, if His Majesty choose to come and visit us, that the expenditure in connexion with his visit would be extraordinary expenditure? </para>

                            <para>- Does the honorable senator think that any expenditure of that kind would be an extraordinary expenditure? If so, I disagree entirely with his view. I say that our Constitution consists, among other things, of a King, and if the King came to visit us, the expenditure in connexion with the visit of His Majesty would not be extraordinary expenditure. It might occur extraordinarily seldom, but when it did occur it would be expenditure within the very lines of the Constitution, and would be ordinary expenditure. </para>

                            <para>- That section was put into the Constitution Act very cautiously. It was inserted to prevent tucking on to the Appropriation Bill items or Bills which had no special relation to the subject. I. say that I never stood up for our rights more strongly than I am doing now, when I stand up for the rights of both Houses and for the rights of the Constitution. There is no tacking here at all. It is "ordinary " expenditure in the best sense of the word. We can only expect to maintain our rights, which, I am prepared to assert on every opportunity, by being just and true to the rights of the other branch, of the Legislature. </para>

                        <para>- The ordinary expenditure, the expenditure absolutely necessary to keeping all the services in going condition. Take the case of a private railway company for instance. We know the general manager of a railway company has authority to pay the wages of the men who are engaged in carrying on the business of the railway, but if any extraordinary works are necessary, such as the purchase of new locomotives, the purchase of new rolling-stock, or the extension of lines, the directors have to be consulted. The power of the general manager goes no further than the ordinary expenditure incurred in carrying on the usual business of the company. Now that is our contention with regard to the Commonwealth. We say that the power of the House of Representatives ends with the ordinary annual services. I was very much amused by the way several honorable senators dealt with this question. They seem to think that this expenditure of about £140,000- it was about £140,000, although it is set down at £43,000 in the Estimates - falls under the heading of ordinary annual expenditure, while the erection of a post-office, they contend, would not. Well, I say that if the contention of honorable senators is correct, the House of Representatives could vote a million sterling for the erection of a post-office in Melbourne. They could do so with the assistance of members of the House of Representatives for New South Wales, and they could claim that the expenditure was necessary to the conduct of the business of the post-office. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I wish to point out to the honorable senator that no work is permanent. If we are to believe the geologists the earth itself is not permanent. We cannot therefore talk about permanence. I know that honorable senators will use every endeavour to get out of the hole in which they have placed themselves, but they cannot do it. If we adopt the principle on the present occasion in. regard to this expenditure in connexion, with the visit of the Heir Apparent to the Tin-one ; if that can by any method of reasoning be brought within the category of our ordinary annual services, then I say the erection of post-offices or custom houses, or the erection of any house or place in connexion with any of the services of the Commonwealth, comes under the same category. </para>

I do not think that sort of thing is at all desirable or necessary. As I said before, we are not here in the position of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, between whom there exists a mutual jealousy and hatred. Each of the Houses in this Parliament is elected by the people of the Commonwealth. The duties, rights, and privileges of each House are laid down in the Constitution. I was going to say they are clearly laid down, but. if they were we should not have had this discussion this evening. I attribute the muddiness of the Constitution in this particular to the presence of so many lawyers in the Convention. We had a number of lawyers there, and they brought all their legal wit and subtlety and learning, combined with their statesmanship, to bear in framing the Constitution. </para>

We have one honorable senator who occupied a seat in the Convention, but who could not tell us what the Convention meant. We do not care two straws what it meant. All we care is as to what is written in the Constitution, and I say the phrase admits of no other interpretation than this - "The current expenses of the services handed over by the States to the Commonwealth." </para>

                        <para>- We cannot possibly punish . Ministers .in any other way. In this case I will guarantee the money has been spent. All that you can do in matters -of this sort is to say -to 'Ministers, "Your yearly expenditure was extravagant," ".and if it is thought desirable, to censure them accordingly, or else turn - them out of office altogether. Every one will admit that these items of expenditure are warranted. As an old Treasurer, I say they undoubtedly come within the category of ordinary services of the Government. Of course they are extraordinary in one sense, and some honorable senators, looking at them from that point of view, consider that they ought not to be included in this particular Bill. I will point out that they -are not extraordinary in the sense that a Treasurer looks upon them. .Expenses of this kind must "crop up, and the Treasurer has to meet them. Both in England and throughout the colonies he places them in the next Estimates as the ordinary expenditure of the Government, ;and he .gets a vote of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I think there will be very few border line items. I think -we shall do well to wait and see if the other Chamber will treat us :fairly, as I think they will. If we think they are going to trench upon our privileges, then . it will be time enough to cry out. I do not. think Ave ought to suggest to the other branch of the legislature the merest possibility of their doing anything that would trench on our privileges. I am sure they will not do it willingly, any more than they did it in sending this Bill up to us in the .first instance. That action resulted . from one of those inadvertences which show how difficult it is for people to understand the meaning of words. They sent up this Bill as a Supply Bill, but it was never a Supply Bill, and because they chose to consider it as a Supply Bill in another place, they sent it up here as a- Supply Bill without the details with which a Supply Bill should have been accompanied. In all cases in Victoria they send up as part of" the Supply Bill the whole of the Estimates that are voted by Parliament, and if the Treasurer had not got it into his head that this Bill was a Supply Bill, they might have sent it up in the ordinary way as an Appropriation Bill, because it was purely an Appropriation Bill up till the end of the financial year. The financial year ends on the 30th June, and it- was an Appropriation Bill up till the end of the year containing all the necessary items of the Estimates, and the whole confusion arose through calling it a Supply Bill, which at the same time contained no items of expenditure. The Supply Bill is a Bill based on the Estimates of the previous year, and I have a little Bill here which shows exactly what it means. This is an Act to apply out of the general revenue the sum of £400,000 for the services of the three months ending 30th September, 1S99, and it provides that no .appropriation shall be made out of the sum mentioned in excess of the rates voted for similar establishments for the year ended 30th June, 1899. There were no items before the House of Assembly where the Bill was initiated and sent on . to the Legislative Council, and there could be no items ; and although . it may be said that every Appropriation Bill is a Supply Bill, .and every Supply Bill is an Appropriation Bill, yet treasurers and financiers in Parliament .know what is meant by a Supply Bill as distinguished from an Appropriation Bill. They are different things altogether, and the terms have their own meanings attached to them, and it is because honorable senators have looked at the ' technical meanings of the words " ordinary annual services of the Government " that they say that this expenditure is quite extraordinary. If honorable Senators will just look through the various items they will see where that view will lead them to, because there are dozens and dozens of .items which are not required for the ordinary services of the year. I have just looked over a number of these miscellaneous items, and I notice that there is one for expenditure in connexion with the Federal Postal Conference in -Melbourne. That might be regarded -as extraordinary. There are three items 'under the head of the Treasury, and then there are items for the draping of the Customs house, and so on. These are all ordinary expenses of the year, from the point of view of the Treasurer ; but to the man walking in the street they might seem extraordinary. They are not extraordinary, however, from the view of the men who drafted this Constitution. I was one of those who made the first draft in 1891, and I know that in putting in words to the effect we 'did - and there were a good many old Treasurers there - we had it then plainly in our mind that the.Senate was not to have included in the ordinary Appropriation Bill for the year any expenses which ought to be voted separately. We intended that there should be no tacking" on of Bills, such as happened in connexion with the. Darling grant, when because one of the Houses would not pass it, it was tacked on to the Appropriation Bill .for the year. 'The provision made in section 54 -was primarily for the purpose of preventing backing, and in order to give to the Senate the right to say whether they would agree to vote money for new works. Some honorable senators who have spoken about a post-office being built, and the vote -for the expenditure being included in &gt;an ordinary -Supply Bill, cannot have had -any considerable amount of experience in the working of Parliamentary institutions in this country. We could not do any such thing as that in our -State. Any proposal for the building of a post-office would have to be brought in in the ordinary way and would have to be voted upon as a separate matter. After the two Houses had agreed that the post-office should be erected, items might appear on the Estimates .afterwards for first or second instalments of the votes necessary for the erection of the post-office- that is in the event of the cost being defrayed out of revenue - but before that, the two .Houses would have been consulted and have expressed an opinion upon the matter. </para>

                        Symon splits straws when he says that I am distinctly technical. He told me that I was using the word "service" as distinguished from "expenditure," but I would ask what are the services of theGovernment
                        The services are what the honorable
                        has pointed out. Those departments that are handed over to the Commonwealth of Australia, and those that are created under it, are "ordinary annual services," and they are all the services necessary for carrying on the business of the Commonwealth in an ordinary way. But if the Government can entertain the Duke of Cornwall and York and other illustrious visitors, and the citizens of the Commonwealth, then they can come down to Parliament to-morrow with ah item of £100,000, and claim that this is "ordinary annual expenditure."
                        I ha ve no hesitation whatever in adhering to the position which I believe to be correct ; and it is because I am so firmly convinced that I am in the right, and that if this resolution is negatived it will mean that the Government can build a post-office without allowing us to amend the item for the expenditure of money for such a purpose, that 1 hold to my view.
                        Symon says that the true construction is - such works are as necessary in the ordinary conduct of the departments.

                        <para>- I have here a report from the Standing Orders Committee, and if I do not lay it on the table at once, it is because I am requested by the Postmaster-General not to do so. The honorable gentleman has informed me that he wishes to proceed with the Supply Bill, and he wants to have a Chairman of Committees appointed in order that the Senate may go into committee upon that Bill. The Minister thought that if I brought up the report of the Standing Orders Committee, and he moved its adoption now, it might take a long time to discuss. That was my object in keeping back the report until after the motion was disposed of. </para>

                    <para>- That will be provided for by the standing orders. It is impossible for the Standing Orders Committee to draw up standing orders unless they know whether . there is to be a Chairman of Committees or not. If there is to be no Chairman of Committees, probably one-third of the standing, orders will have to be- altered. The committee must know before we can go on. </para>

I am only pointing out to the Minister that the question whether there is to he a Chairman or not is not all that we have to deal with. We shall have to settle the point whether we give the Chairman the vote he is entitled to under the Constitution, or whether he shall be deprived of that vote. </para>

Some senators may not desire that a Bill should be printed, while others may not want the second reading taken at the next meeting. of the Senate. While a senator may not object to this report being printed he may object to it being considered on a particular date. </para>

Though it has not been before us for a second reading before, we have really been several days discussing its provisions. It is merely for the purpose of appropriating from the consolidated revenue a sum of £491,882, and it takes the form of an ordinary Appropriation Bill. I move - </para>

So far as this Chamber is concerned, I think it would not have been an unreasonable thing to have expected a message in reply to our message, even if it had only been to the effect that, upon consideration of the matter, another Bill had been introduced which would be forwarded to us in the usual way. I think that would have been the means of allaying a certain amount of possible irritation or friction. The Bill we returned has been thrown aside, our message disregarded, and a new Bill introduced. </para>

                            <para>- The usual course is, when a message is sent from one Chamber to another, for a message to be sent in reply if it demands a reply. Our circumstances are entirely different to the ordinary circumstances that exist in regard to messages between the two Houses. I believe it was an unusual course, so far as the practice hitherto pursued is concerned, for a Bill on the second reading to be' sent back to the other Chamber requesting certain amendments or additions, but I think it would have been conducive to amicable relations between the two Houses if a message had been sent to us in reply. I will not raise the question as to whether the other Chamber acted rightly in putting the Bill on one side and passing another Bill. It might be that that was the only course of action open to the Government, and after the disclaimer in the other Chamber of any desire to interfere with the rights or privileges of- the Senate, I would not for a moment assume that the present action has been taken through anything but inadvertence, but I certainly do think it would have been a courteous thing to have returned a message to this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- Any honorable senator could do that, but I do not suppose it would be worth while. I am very glad to find that the Bill comes before us containing the whole of the items for the various departments for which moneys are required to be voted, and while I recognise in so far as certain Bills are concerned that we have no right to amend them beyond the power of suggestion, Still. I hope the Senate will assert that right on future occasions, and will insist that in Supply Bills we should be furnished with the same information that is furnished to the other Chamber when they are called upon to deal with a BUI of this nature. In regard to Appropriation Bills after the House has gone into committee to consider the question of Supply, the Bill is introduced, founded upon the report of the committee, and it does not embrace the particular items, but merely the gross amounts for the services under particular heads. </para>

                            <para>- I think it should be clearly understood that we should have the whole of these particulars placed before us in exactly the same way as they are placed before the other Chamber, in order that we may have as full an opportunity of dealing with the various items that come up for consideration. I am induced to make these remarks, because I observe there is a feeling that that should not be done, and therefore it is well that we should make our position perfectly clear. I also notice that we are now asked to pass a BUI containing the words "for the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives," while the Bill which was originally introduced contained the words "be it enacted by the King's most excellent Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of . Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia as follows." It would have been much more satisfactory had the Bill contained the preamble originally inserted. </para>

On more than one occasion I have been pictorially represented in the r61e of the American colonel, to whom the coon in the tree says, "Don't shoot, I'll come down." Last week, however, the Ministry did not even allow me to load my gun. I had only to intimate that I proposed to do so, when the Ministry climbed right down. I wish that they had remained down. They cut out the whole preamble an hour or two after I had given notice of motion for an instruction to the committee that we did not want it. </para>

                            <para>.- The coon came down, but he had not the good sense to stop down ; he must bark up another sapling, and it happened to be the wrong one. The consequence is that a Bill has been sent up from which this royalistic grovel, as I have heard it described, is omitted. I am personally a strong royalist, but I did not like the extraordinarily worded preamble that we had in the first Bill. While these words have been left out, however, other words have been put in that are, to my mind, equally objectionable with the others, as relating to the authority of this Senate in connexion with money matters. The Senate does possess authority in connexion with money matters, as provided within the four corners of our Constitution, and the limitations that exist are after all of a small character when we compare the powers of this Chamber with those that attach to the House of Lords, or any Upper House in the Australian States. I do not think that I ought to be tempted to make a speech that I easily could make on this subject. It would be a simple matter, indeed, to indulge in large quotations from responsible authorities. It would be easy to introduce a great number of arguments in favour of the omission of the words to which my motion applies - words that take to themselves or that imply that the sole right of giving Supply is in the hands of the other House. I say a lengthy speech might readily be made. There is even scope for showing research ; but I believe the Senate is sufficiently at one to make any lengthy remarks unnecessary. I shall content myself with a short speech, and point out the words to which I object in the Bill. They are these - </para>

Whether it had its origin in South Australia or not, it is quite sufficient for us that it is in the Constitution. Is there not a great . difference between the power of suggestion and the power of amendment'! From one point of view it has been urged that there is not much difference, because both a suggestion and an amendment have the same effect. But is not the "difference this - that in a Bill we have no power to amend ? The grant made by the House that has power to originate ; and that House alone has the power to amend. Is not that implied? ; </para>

He said that no grant can be made without the concurrence of this Chamber ; that is to say, that no money can be voted without the concurrence of this Chamber. A Supply Bill cannot get through the English Parliament without the concurrence of the House of Lords. So that the mere fact that . a Bill cannot be passed without being agreed to by this Chamber does not show that we are on an equality with the other Chamber in respect to making a grant. </para>

Yet, there is no doubt that in Great Britain the Commons are the sole source of supplies. \ </para>

Of course, I admit at once that we must have the power before we can make a suggestion, but I think the manifest interpretation of the section relating to the matter covers any portion of the Bill which may be under the consideration of the committee. Let me point out that if that were not the case it would be within the power of the other Chamber to place in a measure of this character any sort of claim that they might see fit, a claim that they would know could not be sustained, a claim which was manifestly wrong, and which might even be put in for the purpose of flouting the Senate, supposing there had been a difficulty between the two Houses. lt must appear at once that that would never be within the power of the other Chamber. If, for the sake of argument, we could not make such a suggestion as this, this House would be reduced to the position of being compelled either to tacitly acknowledge the claim of the other Chamber or else to take upon itself the very serious responsibility of rejecting a measure that might be urgently necessary to carry on the public service.

                            <para>- We must send back the Bill with a message ; but I submit that that would not assist us in the way in which we are entitled to claim assistance at the present time. Now, the clause to which exception has been taken - "for the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives " - has evidently been inserted by the other Chamber with the distinct object of claiming the right to make grants in this particular way, and they have done that with a view of our. simply assenting to the claim that they have the absolute right of making the appropriation. Now, I am perfectly convinced that members of this Senate do not consider that the other Chamber has any exclusive right of this character at all. Notwithstanding the forms or orders they may go through for the purpose of considering what amount of money shall be voted, we are not bound by anything that they may do in that particular way. The wording of the Constitution Act clearly shows how laws are to be passed - </para>

                            <para>- Though we do not represent exactly the same constituencies, we appeal to the same electors, and the same reasons, no doubt, actuated the people in seeding us to this Chamber as actuated them in sending the representatives to the other Chamber, although the representation here is not placed on the same basis of equality as it is in the other Chamber, because we are called upon to represent States as our constituencies instead of electorates. In that way, some senators represent more electors than others, and there is not the same equality. We know perfectly well that this equality of representation of States was given to the smaller States, in order that they might feel that they would not be overweighted, and that their wishes and desires should have the same attention as the wishes and desires of the larger States - that, in fact, they should not be swamped and overridden. It was thought that by this means the smaller States would have an amount of representation which would be adequate to protect their interests whenever they were unfairly dealt with, or whenever it was thought they were being unfairly dealt with by the legislation proposed in another Chamber. But that by no means takes away from us ,the position that we are as much the representatives of the taxpayers in matters of this kind as are members of the other House. We have the right of veto. We can say - "You have sent us this Bill, hut we will not vote a single sixpence "-and the other House cannot do a single thing to compel us to vote any sum, unless by reason of arguments that will convince us we are doing what is wrong and improper. There is no power of bringing the Senate to book as Legislative Councils have been brought to book by making " additional nominations. We stand in an entirely different position. "We are returned by the people of the country, and we can say - " If you think you are voicing the views of the people, and we are not, we are prepared to go before our electors, and answer to them for whatever course of action we take." The fact of the double dissolution absolutely strengthens our position, and recognises our power - our right to stand strongly and firmly. I am quite sure if honorable senators will take the trouble to look into history, and the reasons that existed for laying down the practice that exists in the House of Commons, they will find that the reasons and practice there can have no applicability to our circumstances. We are acting strictly under a statute which gives us certain powers, which restricts us only in certain respects, and we are doing only what is right and proper in insisting on our co-ordinate rights with the other House in dealing with matters of supply. The argument has been used by some honorable senators that the House of Representatives had a right to include in the Bill something to show what they claim. They are not content to rely simply upon the provision of the Constitution which speaks for itself, but they unnecessarily and purposely insert this particular provision that this Act is only for the purpose of appropriating a grant made by the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- That would be another thing altogether. That would show that they had no right to make the grant themselves. They only initiated the grant, and we had to join with them in order that the grant should be made effective. These words were inserted in the Bill in committee.

                    <para class="block">
                        It has been urged that the House of Representatives had to put this provision in to show what is their construction of the Constitution. The first clause of the Bill provides that there shall and may be issued and applied for or towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty a certain sum. That would assume that supply had been granted by some - other body than the body that was passing this measure. Those words in themselves would have been objectionable, because they would still have raised the issue that the House of Representatives had the right of granting the supply for the service* of the State, a condition that we do not admit for one second. When that clause comes on for discussion it will be possible to amend it by omitting the words "issued and applied for, or towards making good the supply.'' The clause would then read - " There shall and may be granted." Then that would show clearly that the money was voted by both Houses of Parliament. I contend that it is only the Parliament that can make the grant and not the one House simply with the assent of the other House. Both Houses must concur in whatever is done, and although we cannot initiate the Bill here or amend it, we must be parties to the grant. I think it should be shown perfectly, clearly, and distinctly what is the position that we take up in this connexion. Of course, if there were any question at all whether our contention was correct ; if we were taking this action only" to try on something we would be in a wrong position ; but whenever the Senate puts its foot down in connexion with matters of this character, it should be put down with a determination not to raise it again unless it is absolutely convinced that it has made a serious and grave error. As far as I can read the Constitution and consider the way in which the practice has arisen in the old country, I fail to see that we are on anything but the most substantial ground when we take up the position that Ls proposed by
                        by eliminating the words referred to, and also eliminating the words in the first clause later on in  order to show clearly and conclusively that while we recognise that such Bills can be initiated only in the other Chamber, and that we have the power of suggestion only, yet we claim the same right, power, and authority to make the grant as does the other Chamber.

                        <para>- I quite realize the. force of the contention raised by the honorable and learned senator. I think it would meet the objection that has been raised, if we were to omit the word "and" between "issued" and " applied," line I, and to insert after the word " applied " the words " and granted." </para>

As I have said, the whole proceeding is novel, and no one can be blamed if the exact language is not as we would put it if we sat in calm deliberation for an hour or two. The substance of it is, that we desire to see that the Senate has the concurrent right to grant the money as well as to indicate the source from which it is to come. I would indicate that by inserting the word "granted" between "may be" and "issued," line 1, we then raise the point which we wish to affirm. Strike out, if you will, the subsequent word "granted." If you insert the word "granted" before the word "issued," that will show that we join in the grant. </para>

                        <para>- I think we are agreed as to what we are endeavouring to achieve, and that is to secure an acknowledgment that the Senate has the right to grant equally with the other House. I was going to suggest that that would probably be achieved in this way. The clause reads - </para>

It is not necessary for any purpose tile Senate has in view that we should insist on putting in the Bill the words that the Senate grants the money. It is sufficient if we take from tho Bill all claim from the House of Representatives that they are solely granting it. The object may be attained by the omission of two lines in the enactment clause and then' making the clause read somewhat as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- This Bill as it comes to us is a Bill to issue and apply. By suggesting the alteration I have just recommended we shall not raise the question about granting. What is objected to by the Senate is an assertion of another place that they have made the grant. If .that is excluded from the Bill there is no cause of offence. There would be no. assertion that the money is granted. If we pass- a Bill issuing and applying the money everything necessary is done. It is not necessary to go out of our way to provoke a contest over this matter. I would so alter the measure that there is no assertion on the part of the House of Representatives that they have made this grant exclusively ; and surely we may allow it to go without making the assertion that the Senate has made the grant. There can be no loss of honour or dignity to either Chamber in adopting the suggestion I have made. We then carry out the intention of this Bill by making it an Appropriation Bill, and say nothing as to the way the money is granted. </para>

That gets over the whole difficulty, and is a courteous recognition of the very large powers possessed by the House of Representatives.

The origination of the Bill need not appear upon the face of it. The origination comes from th Commonwealth Constitution Act and (nothing else. We do not need to put in words with which the other House may disagree, and which may give rise to a conflict between the two Houses. All we need to do is to strike out debatable words and leave the Constitution, to speak for itself. </para>

"We cannot but be aware that the claim that was made by the other Chamber was that the origination of this measure in that Chamber should appear on the face of it, and as the Constitution Act provides that a message is necessary, the recital that that message has been sent to the House of Representatives would practically grant to the other House all that they were entitled to have placed on the face of the measure. I think it would be wise for this Chamber to take that step, hut if it is not deemed acceptable I will not press it. I suggest that we should recite before the words " be it enacted" that a message in terms of section 56 has gone to the House of Representatives.

                            <para>- We are not .dealing with mistakes, we are dealing with facts. According to the terms of the Constitution it is necessary that a Bill of this kind should be preceded by a message, and I suggest that we should make that fact appear on the face of the Bill. That indicates the: origination, which is all that the other place is entitled to, and I submit that an amendment of that kind by way of suggestion should be included. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that there would be: any objection to the proposal, although it would be novel. But I say that we are not officially seized of the fact that this message has been delivered. I recollect perfectly well a case in which a Bill of this character came to the Legislative Council, when it was found that a message had not been received in another place. Assuming that the House was inclined to make such an alteration, I think it would be advisable not to send it down as a suggestion, but rather to let the other House put. it in. The Minister would convey to his colleagues no doubt what he believed to be the view held by members of the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I think the force of the honorable and learned senator's suggestion lies in the fact that for the first time this House has co-ordinate power in the granting of Supply. We have no direct intercourse with the Governor-General, and do not know that those things have been done that should be done. It is, therefore, imperative that we should have a declaration on the face of the Bill that everything has been done that puts us in a constitutional position to pass the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I think that if we reflected we should be inclined to come to the conclusion . that the other Chamber might resent our setting them right on the constitutional steps they have taken to properly do their part in the granting of supply. As a matter of fact we are acting in the dark in endeavouring to lead them into the light. Why should we suggest to them something that has been fully in their minds ? The very underlying argument is that they have done this thing rightly, and that the message has been delivered, and if we put these words in we assume either that the message has not been received, or that the other House did not know their duty. Now, I think that, instead of making matters better we should make them very much worse by introducing anything of the kind. It is enough for us to protect our own constitutional rights, and to make no more suggestions than are absolutely necessary. I hope the amendment will be left as it is. </para>

I can recollect more than one instance in which Bills have been introduced into the Assembly, and it has been afterwards found that they ought to have been introduced by message.

Of course it has been done constitutionally and properly, or else we would not consider it. I, therefore, object to the insertion of unnecessary words which will only assert something which we are already agreed upon.

Otherwise, if the House of Representatives agree to the suggestions we shall have to alter the title. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia). - It is quite clear there must be a gap somewhere. Suppose we send this back to the other House with a message respectfully drawing their attention to these suggestions, and that they adopt the suggestions, and the Bill comes back to us. We can surely have no power to make additional amendments, and again ask the concurrence of the other House. I am not with the honorable senator who desires to make further amendments, but suppose any honorable senator does desire to have the schedule reconsidered, it would be impossible to have it done. We cannot possibly send back a further schedule of suggestions, and go on in a kind of see-saw ; there must be some period at which the Senate brings its suggested amendments to an end. That period ought, I think, to be now.

                            <para>- Well, that it .be brought up. The honorable senator must move that. The committee must authorize him to bring up the report. Of course, ordinarily, that could apply only where Bills come to the House in the ordinary way, when the work of the committee is done and the Bill is finished with. But we are now under a new practice. We have to bring up a report, which must be adopted in the House, sending back this Bill with a respectful message as to certain suggestions to the other House. But it cannot be moved until the whole report is brought up. It is a new usage ; at the stage we have reached it seems to me that the honorable senator should be in a position to move the reconsideration of the schedule. </para>

The South Australian standing orders do not deal with this question of suggestion.- It is all left to a question of practice. One honorable senator from South Australia seems to be slightly at variance with another honorable senator on that point, and I therefore propose as a way out of the difficulty that I make the report to the Senate. On my making a report to the Senate any honorable senator who wants a recommittal can then move for it, and the President,- who knows the practice, will be able to deal with it. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to the motion. We have been contending during the session for equality as between the Senate and the House of Representatives, and a senator of standing and position has raised the question why so many Bills should be initiated in the House of Representatives when they could just as we'll have been introduced in the Senate. It has been urged with some show of reason that there should be equality as far as possible between the positions of the two Houses. That being so, and seeing that the House of Representatives has adopted the schedule in which it is proposed that the Chairman of Committees should receive £500 in addition to his salary as senator, surely those honorable senators who urged that the Senate should maintain an equality of work, dignity, power, and position with the House of Representatives, are not going to reduce the salary of the Chairman of Committees to an amount £300 lower than will be paid to the Chairman of Committees in the other Chamber. I yield to no senator in my desire to effect a reasonable economy, but I do not take my cue from the practice that has been enforced in the Legislative Council of South Australia. I by no means put this Senate on terms of equality with the Legislative Council of South Australia or any other Legislative Council in Australia. We should be reducing our Chairman to a position he should not occupy by paying him the small, sum of £200 in addition to the £400 he draws as a senator. To ask the Chairman to sit here hour after hour, day after day, and it may be night after night in some instances, for the paltry sum of £200 is asking too much for too little money. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, and it is reducing one of our officers to a position he should not occupy. The proposal that we should have no Chairman, but that some honorable senator should relieve the President on some occasions is preposterous. It is unworkable, and the miserable saving likely to be effected by taking that course is not worthy of the Senate. I sincerely hope the motion will not be carried. </para>

                        <para>- The House of Representatives has never recognised the importance of our position more strongly than by sending up this Bill in the form in which it stands in respect to this item. The other Chamber recognises that from our constitutional position we need a Chairman of Committees and that there are important matters to be dealt with in committee. We are, in fact, in a position different from that of any Legislative Council in regard to our committee work. Is our first act going to be to abnegate even what the House of Representatives have chosen to give, us? After all the strong assertions I have heard from honorable senators with regard to the position of the Senate - assertions with which I am entirely in sympathy - I cannot understand the reason for this motion. In accordance with our power of suggesting amendments we shall have to go into committee frequently. We shall have such work to do in committee that it will be quite unreasonable to expect the President to act both as Chairman of Committees and President. Indeed, we have practically decided that point already. It is not at all worth our while to reduce the salary as proposed. The Chairman of Committees will have to be here always. His attendance will be practically perpetual, and we do not know how long he will have to sit in the chair. We are in an embryonic position at present. The duties of the Chairman will develop as the work increases. If we assert our rights, as I hope we shall, the committee work will be very considerable, and probably our proceedings in committee will be protracted. The salary suggested is by no means too high. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot support this amendment. We have been only' a week or two in session, and there are centuries before this Commonwealth. Australia will grow to have a revenue larger than the revenues of most of the European States. Even now the revenue of the Commonwealth is greater than is that of some of the present European States. Surely we are not going to belittle ourselves, to use a common word, by cutting down the emoluments of the Chairman of Committees to£200, plus the £400 which he will receive as a senator1. I hope we shall be prudent and careful in regard to the expenditure of the country, but this reduction is not at all necessary. We need not, to begin with, show a spirit of meanness. We have practically decided that we shall have a Chairman of Committees, and that being so, let us deal with the matter equitably and fairly. I shall do my utmost to curtail expenditure, but I hope the Senate will not agree to the present proposal. I presume that the salary of the Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives is not to be touched by this Chamber. It would be most ungracious on our part to propose to reduce the salary of an officer of another place. </para>

                        (Queensland). - I hope honorable senators will not be in too great haste over this matter. I sat very quietly cheering both sides during the great discussion on the question of tweedledum and tweedledee. Therefore I trust the committee will not be too anxious to arrive at a decision before they- hear what some of us have to say with regard to federal expenditure. I am certain that when
                        addressed various meetings in Victoria before the elections, he told the electors that if he were returned to the Senate he would endeavor to see that the money of the Commonwealth was economically expended. The electors, probably knowing what a business-like man
                        is, elected him believing that he would do so ; but when he gets into the Senate he, in a lordly way, supports a proposal to pay £900 per annum to the Chairman of Committees, an office which is not necessary at all in the opinion of some of the most capable men who have come, from South Australia. £900 would be a very large salary to pay for the work which will be required in this Chamber. My proposal is that the Chairman of Committees should get £600 per annum altogether, including his salary as a senator. That will be a very fair salary to pay for the work that will have to be done.
                        has expressed great surprise that a member of the Senate who is anxious that we should have more work to do has expressed a wish 'to cut down the  salary of the  Chairman  of Committees.

I certainly will not vote for a reduction in the salary of the Chairman of Committees of the Senate unless a similar reduction is made in the salary of the Chairman of the other House. I am not going to put our Chairman in the invidious position of receiving very much less than does the Chairman of the other House. The House of Representatives has recognised our equality and has granted an equal sum tb each officer, and are we going to stultify ourselves by deliberately proposing that our Chairman is to get £200 only a year beyond his salary as a senator. I shall vote against the motion. </para>

                            <para>- I consider my salary is more nearly proportioned to the salary of the man to whom the honorable senator referred than is the salary of the Chairman, who is to be given four or five hundred a year for doing very little more than I have to do. We have a right to be careful with the money of the people, and we have no right to show a vast disproportion in its distribution when men who ought to be claiming our attention are almost on the point of starvation. I do not think we should give £500 a year extra to an already well-paid member of the Senate for carrying out almost nominal duties. </para>

                        <para>- It must be remembered that every senator receives £400 a year, and that for this extra work it is proposed to give only £200 a year. We have nothing to do therefore with 'the payment of £400 a year; the amount proposed to be granted is for extra work done. I may mention for the information of senators that in the Legislative Council of New South Wales the Chairman of Committees gets £500 a year. Then again, if the President happens to be ill, or absent, I presume the Chairman would be acting-President. In New South Wales we have seen a Speaker ill for month after month, and the Chairman sat night after night doing his duty. I think the Chairman is in a sense an understudy for the Presidentship. He would not necessarily be made President, but he is supposed to be able to perform the Presidents duties. I consider we should put ourselves in a most undignified position if we allowed any officer of the House to receive less emolument than is received by a similar officer in another House. With regard to the argument that the duties are such that the Chairman should be content with £200, because we take less time in our work, I think the senator who made the suggestion in order to be consistent ought to suggest that senators themselves get less pay on the same ground. I think we should be making a great mistake in accepting this suggestion. </para>

I am sure every reasonable minded person is satisfied that whatever we do in reference to our Chairman, they will see that theirs has £500. </para>

                            <para>- That is what I was going to remark. It might as well be said that anything at all is good enough for the workman who will do the work. The answer is, that if we want a good and efficient man to do the work we must make the salary a bait for him. It seems to me to be a grotesquely absurd thing for honorable senators, who are paid £400 a year for lazily lounging in their seats and getting into a little bit of intellectual excitement, to say that they are not paid too much, but that it is wrong to pay a man who has to keep his mind centred on the work of the chair a sum of £500 per annum. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear that. If we cut down the amount to £200 per annum, we shall not be able to get any one to take the chair permanently. If we reduce the amount, our. only course will be to choose between the President and a succession of amateurs. The President, I think, would very properly show an unwillingness to do this detail work in addition to the very responsible and very authoritative duties that he has now to perform. I think, in the long run, we may lose far more by having to get some one to go in the chair who has not studied the standing orders, who will make mistakes, and bring about delay and recommittals. We should save far more than the difference between £200 and £500 by having an efficient as compared with an inefficient Chairman. I think the whole thing comes back to this. A salary of £500 per annum seems to be the amount that is usually paid to chairmen of committees in Legislatures all over Australia. In the House of Lords, I believe, the Chairman of Committees gets £2,000 or £3,000 per annum. </para>

I want to know more particularly what are the circumstances in the Senate differing from those of the House of Representatives that should induce us to take up a different position in this matter, thereby proclaiming, as we do to the public, that this Senate has to do with very little power, but with a great deal of talk, and that when it comes to the pinch we recognise that we have not as much work to do as have the House of Representatives. The Constitution very particularly says that there is absolutely nothing that can be done in the other House that cannot be done in the Senate, and I say the best way for us to get our share of the work is to establish machinery and officers, which will be an encouragement to the Executive to send us the business, knowing as they will that we have persons who are capable and willing to carry it out. </para>

There seems to be a general impression that the senator who is to be appointed Chairman of Committees is going to enjoy a double existence; that he is going to carry out his duties as Chairman, and also be in this House as a senator, so that he is to be a double entity. I take it that nothing of the sort will happen. He will merely carry out one set of duties as Chairman of Committees. In receiving £400 a year as a
                        will also receive that sum as  Chairman  of Committees. Consequently we are justified in speaking of his salary as being £600 a year. We have heard eulogies of the personality of this Senate, and it has been said that the salaries have attracted to it some of the best men in Australia. We are, however, told by the same senators that £600 a year is not sufficient to attract a man great enough to carry out the duties of the  Chairman  of Committees. The insinuation has been thrown out that the object of this amendment is to belittle the Senate, inasmuch as no such proposal would be made with regard to the other Chamber. But I am prepared to move a similar proposal in regard to the House of Representatives, and I think that would be a very fair proposal to make under the circumstances.

                        <para>- I find that in addition to the President and the Chairman of Committees we have in connexion with the Senate a Clerk of Parliaments, a Clerk- Assistant, an Usher of the Black Rod, a Clerk of the Papers, and a shorthand writer and typist. I want to know what all these officers have to do? It appears to me that while we have all set out with the word economy on our lips we are very chary of practising it when it comes to the point. In Queensland the business of the Legislative Assembly is done by a Clerk, a Clerk-Assistant, and an ordinary clerk. Those three officers do the whole of the work. Can the Postmaster-General tell us what the Usher of the Black Rod does? "What are his particular functions ? "Where is the rod? Is it like Aaron's rod that budded ? It buds to the tune of £550 per annum, at all events. Then there is the Clerk of the Papers. What does he do? It appears to me that we have too many officers in connexion with this Chamber. The ship is overmanned. Instead of setting out with due regard to economy, our Estimates have been framed, so far as the officers are concerned, on a most magnificent scale. It appears to me that we are only instituting a number of sinecures. I intend to move the reduction of some of these salaries, but before doing so I should like the Postmaster-General to satisfy my curiosity in regard to the Usher of the Black Rod and the Clerk of the Papers. We know what the Clerk of the Parliaments has to do. He is employed while Parliament is sitting, and will have a good deal of work to do when Parliament is not in session. We also require a Clerk- Assistant. But for the life of me I cannot find out what the other officers are for, with the exception perhaps of the shorthand writer and typist. My opinion is at present that those other officers might very well be done without. Will the Minister give me the information I desire? </para>

                        (Queensland). - I asked for information from the Postmaster-General, and have not got it. The honorable senator apparently considers that I know more about the duties of the Usher of the Black Rod than he does. I am in entire and absolute ignorance of the functions of this officer; and the very fact that the Minister has not told us what the officials are and what they do is sufficient evidence that work for them does not exist. If they performed useful functions I am certain that the Minister would be quite able to tell us what they are. I think the Clerk of "Parliaments is over-paid at £900 per annum, and the Clerk- Assistant at £750, but I do not intend to move any reduction in those salaries. As to what the Minister says in regard to keeping up the dignity of Parliament, I reply that we have nothing to do with dignity. We are sent here to do the business of the country. The country doe3 not care two straws whether we are dignified or undignified. We do not pay officers to maintain dignity or to keep up a dignified appearance or to sit in a dignified attitude. We pay them to do the work of the country and of this Parliament. This talk about dignity should be left out of the question altogether. I again state that the Minister has not told us what the Usher of the Black Rod does. I therefore back up my criticism by moving -

                            <para>- I think that the staff of the House of Representatives is much too large. We are all talking economy, but none of us appear to practise it. We have a Clerk of the House of Representatives, a Clerk- Assistant, a Clerk-Assistant to the Clerk-Assistant. Then we have a Serjeant-at-Arms and a Clerk of Committees at £550. It appears to me that those officials are in a much better position than are Members of Parliament. I have a strong inclination to go in for one of those billets. Then we have a Clerk of Papers and Accountant at £420, a Clerk of Records at £350, an Assistant Clerk of Committees and Reading Clerk at £300, and an Assistant Reading Clerk at £200, and an innumerable army of doorkeepers. It appears to to me that each senator has a doorkeeper attached to his own person as a valet. I suppose it is utterly hopeless to attempt to carry any suggestion in the way of a reduction. But I think it is proper to express my opinion on this point, and I think that instead of proceeding to work economically we are starting out on a very lavish scale indeed. </para>

I do not think the explanation of the honorable gentleman with regard to the private secretary to the Vice-President of the Executive Council is satisfactory. The Vice-President himself is not here. I understand he is away in Sydney attending to his law business. I do not blame that honorable gentleman. He is not being paid anything as a Minister, but if his duties are so onerous, why is he not here? If his duties can be performed by a secretary, or by the Postmaster-General, with the assistance of a secretary, why have a Vice-President at all ? It appears to me that this is only another of the billets which have been created for friends by certain members of the Commonwealth Government. We have made a very bad start in this Commonwealth Government so far as I have been able to discover. It has been a case in many ways of providing something for one's friend.

I am not going to take up the time of the Senate by referring to very many of the items, but one item certainly strikes me as being very high. I refer to the appointment of a secretary to the Minister for External Affairs at a salary of £800 per annum. </para>

As several honorable senators have put it, I suppose that nearly every member of the Federal Parliament went before the electors with the cry of economy upon his lips. </para>
