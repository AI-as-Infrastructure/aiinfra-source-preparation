                        <para>- It has been assumed throughout the discussion both in this House and another place that this question is of the most superlative importance to Australia, and that it ought to be disposed of at once. As to its immediate pressing importance, I confess that I am not so thoroughly well satisfied as are a number of honorable senators who have spoken on the subject. But what I think is of immediate pressing importance is the method in which we deal with the question. I have no fear of any sudden inroad of the races that we wish to exclude. It cannot possibly occur in many cases. It certainly will not occur in the case of other nations, and I firmly agree with what some gentlemen have had the courage to say, both on the platform and elsewhere, that to a large extent this is a question of political capital rather than of immediate importance to the Commonwealth. And from the point of view of political capital, it has been torn into rags. Look round at all the complaints that have been made from time to time; take the best statistics we can get, and we find that practically no mischief has been done. There has been no increase in the coloured population; there has practically been a decrease. The kanaka question, which has to be dealt with separately, is on a different basis. But taking the whole of this terrorism which has been going through Australia - which has induced us to put the Imperial Government in a most uncomfortable position from time to time, and to worry them, to my mind, very unnecessarily, when they were worried enough - it is all political platform business, and there is no question of black or white in it. I do not anticipate or fear any great intermixture of races from any Asiatics who may come here. The analogy of the American Republic has no application. The negroes were brought in, and had to stop there in a condition of servitude and under conditions that led to the intermixture of the races, and probably to the deterioration of both. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly not ; I know the standing orders too well to do such a tiling. Victoria has not suffered from coloured immigration. New South Wales has not been burdened with any importations of people from eastern countries. Even as far as Queensland is concerned, the increase has been so small, taking into account the splendid conditions existing there, that I. feel perfectly justified in saying that this is not an urgent matter of practical politics at the present moment. It is merely a political cry for the purpose of obtaining kudos. </para>

                            <para>- It is ridiculous, and I will explain my reason for saying so. So far as the self-governing colonies are concerned, they have no right to make a treaty with any one. They can conduct negotiations, and arrive at their treaties through the medium of the Imperial Government. The Imperial Government, with the great courtesy that they have always shown to us, said thai; they wanted to make a treaty for themselves, but they would not bother us about it at present. They did not know whether we were ripe for it or not. </para>

What I complain of bitterly is that the exclusion of the self-governing colonies from that treaty is said to be a recognition of their right to do what they choose.

                            <para>- The giving of that right meant that, so far as these States were concerned, they were simply "as they were" ; they were no better and no worse off. The exclusion of the self-governing colonies from the terms of the treaty has been ingeniously and most fallaciously used by persons who, I hope, are not jurists or lawyers, as an argument to show that they were intended to be excluded. The Imperial Government having satisfied the Premiers that this was the only thing they could do, the Premiers pledged themselves to adopt the suggestion. They have honestly tried to carry out that pledge. Some of them have succeeded, and some of them have failed. There is nothing before us to show that in any case in which . the terms of the Natal Act have been adopted, the results have not been entirely satisfactory. Even if they have not been entirely satisfactory that fact is not conclusive. We cannot obtain everything in a day. We have certain limited powers, but we are under the Imperial Government, with a strong disposition, I should think, not to complicate them in the carrying out of the , duties imposed upon them. Either this is a matter of urgency or it is not. Honorable senators on the opposite side appear to agree that it is a matter of urgency. </para>

                            <para>- Oh, but the honorable and learned senator does. He has forgotten more than he remembers. Coming to the question, I begin by saying that the voice of Australia is entirely in favour of excluding these coloured aliens as far as is possible. The only question, then, is how it is to be done. Around that question the real fight must take place both in one House and in the other. The difference between the direct proposal and the indirect proposal has, of course, been fertile of infinite discussion, and has led to many stonewalling speeches of inordinate length by men who avowed that the matter was of immense urgency, but who could not speak upon it for less than six hours or so. Now they have got it through, and have discussed it as carefully, I think, as any question ever was discussed in any Parliament in the world. I ask anybody who has taken the trouble to carefully read the last speech of the Prime Minister in reply to the debate, whether he can see any answer to it. I can see none. It seems to me that the whole question is put with the most perfect lucidity. The 'Government wants to do this, but the Government is limited in its powers. What is the Government to do ? You say that the matter is urgent and ought to be dealt with at once. The Government say - " Do what we suggest and it will be done." You reply - "This does not do it in the way we want," and the Government say - "This we think is the only way in which we can do it at the present time. Take what you can get, and if that does not work properly get the rest later on." </para>

                            <para>- I dare say, but I am talking of the merits, not about the vote. My honorable and learned friend introduces irrelevant matters. When I am discussing justice my honorable and learned friend refers to votes. That was not the point of view from which I was speaking. The Government certainly wanted to bring down for the exclusion of Asiatic aliens the strongest Bill they, could carry. But the Government on the other hand recognised that they had a duty to the Imperial Government as well as to the Commonwealth. And that is what put them in a difficulty on a matter which although it might be urgent from certain points of view, could be sufficiently dealt with in the manner proposed. I cannot think of any method that will keep more people out than that this Bill proposes. " Fraudulent, lying, hypocritical." These are the terms that have been used. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; I know we are very bold until we are attacked. The Japanese are only a fortnight or so away. They have great power at their back. Let Russia and Japan drop their quarrels, and let there be a little combination between them, and then, perhaps, our friends opposite will not talk in so very loud and clear a tone. At all events we know that we are not the people to say to these Asiatic races - "We shall let you do as you like," when, throughout our career, what we have been saying to them is - " You have got to do as we like." We have taken possession of their country and of their trade, and have told them they must do as we want. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the Home Government will refuse to assent to this Bill. It is on the lines of their own suggestion. Although they thought that 50 words in English should be the test, they said, "You may make it stricter if you please." But what they wanted clearly and unquestionably was that we should see that we made a test which would not, on the face of it, be a gross reflection upon nations friendly to them and to us, and whose friendship they were most anxious to retain. </para>

                            <para>- My speech is entirely in favour of the Bill. My view is that this is not very necessary legislation, but the people of the States declared that it was, and I accepted that situation when I came here. I adhere to my pledges. I said the same thing to them as I say now to the Senate. When it comes to a question of rushing like a bull at a gate, and having war when diplomacy would do all we need, then I ask honorable senators to think of the country from which we have come, and of its circumstances, and to take what they can get. That will give them not only all they want, but probably something more. But if it should not, it will enable them to get in a very short time substantially what they want. If they adopt the more extreme course the result will be delay and correspondence and possibly more mischief than would have been caused by the few aliens who might have gained admission to the Commonwealth. I am not speaking from any party point of view. I am giving to my honorable friends my opinions on a subject about which I have thought a good deal. I hope they will understand that I, like themselves, am doing the best I can to arrive at a sound conclusion. </para>

We know the extraordinary facility the Chinese have for learning languages, and that there is an enormous awakening there. In Africa there are thousands of Egyptians, Algerians, and negroes who can speak, and many who can write, European languages. But even a greater danger than this, to my mind, lies in the millions of coloured people who have settled in various territories belonging to European nations; because the majority of those people can speak, and many of them can write, European languages.

                            <para>- Japan possesses perhaps one of the largest universities in the world. We must admit that such legislation as this is not only detrimental to the national prestige, but that if administered straightforwardly it must be ineffective. If it is not administered honestly, then it will be degrading to us. Our proper course is not to follow the lines laid down in this Bill, but to say at once that on scientific grounds we cannot allow coloured races to come into Australia. We should say clearly, by an Act of Legislation, that on national and ethnological grounds we cannot allow the Japanese, the Chinese, the Hindoos, or any other coloured alien race to come here, because we are able to prove that they cannot blend with us, and that they are bound to grow up separately from us if they do come here. We know that the increase of their numbers is very much greater than that of the white races. We cannot overlook the extraordinary fecundity of these races. Thirty years ago the negro population of the United States numbered 4,000,000. To-day it numbers 12,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I agree with the honorable senator that if we passed a law restricting the Japanese from entering Australia we could neither palliate nor justify any action taken on our part to force our way into Japan. In order to secure Australia for the white races we must make certain sacrifices, and it would be impossible for us to justify our conduct if, while excluding the Japanese from our shores, we were to say that they must not prohibit us from entering their country. Apart from all sentimental reasons, we shall be really carrying out the desires of Japan in excluding the Japanese from Australia. The Japanese Government have said in unmistakable terms that they do not wish their people to leave Japan. That being the case, how can we do them any great injury by providing that Japanese subjects shall not come to Australia ? If we are to take the views expressed by the Japanese Consul as indicating the opinions held by his Government, we have it that he admits the right of the Australian Commonwealth to restrict immigration in any way it thinks fit, Japan, of course, claiming similar rights. We should be prepared to concede them those rights as a matter of fairness. </para>

                            <para>- We should take this action with the knowledge that the Japanese can retaliate if they desire to do so, and we should be prepared to put up with that disability in order to gain what we consider is a great national principle. In India we are faced with another problem. We are dealing there with people belonging to the Empire of which we form a part. But we find that the Government of India does not wish the Hindoos to leave that place. Great objection was raised recently when an effort was made to obtain coolies from India for Fiji and the West Indies. We should not overlook the fact that the British Government do not treat the inhabitants of India in the same way as they treat -the white races. They have never placed the coloured races on the same plane. </para>

                    <para>We would no more insult the ruling races of India by prohibiting the aboriginals of that country from coming here than they would insult us by prohibiting the aboriginals of Australia from going there. They are no more related than are we to the aboriginals of Australia. In touching upon the attitude of the Imperial Government, let us for the sake of argument put Great Britain in our position. We have 100,000 aliens here, and according to the ratio of population between Australia and Great Britain that would mean a population of 1,000,000 aliens in the old country. Within a few days' sail of the British coast there would be also coloured races representing half the population of the world. If Great Britain were so situated would she say - " Let these alien people come in and swamp us "? </para>

                        <para>I wish to say that Her Majesty's Government thoroughly appreciate the object and the needs of the colonies in dealing with this matter. We quite sympathize with the determination of the white inhabitants of these colonies, which are in comparatively close proximity to millions and hundreds of millions of Asiatics, that there shall not be an influx of people alien in civilization, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose influx, moreover, would most seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the existing labour population. An immigration of that kind must, I quite understand, in the interest of the colonies, be prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that object. </para>

                    <para>Then he goes on to say that he prefers the education test. I think Japan thoroughly understands the position we take up. She knows we are a great self-governing community, and that by our Constitution we have a right to deal with alien immigration. She knows that we were excluded from the treaty between herself and Great Britain, and that we have the power to accept that treaty or not. I think it is always understood that a nation that has such a power has practically a sovereign right. That is' practically the prerogative of an independent people. Being aware of all this, is Japan likely to quarrel with Great Britain for assenting to a policy which is not inimical to the policy which she herself adopts, because Japan says that she does not want the Japanese to leave her shores? If it is a question of mere sentiment, the Japanese can easily assuage their consciences by passing an Act of a similar character preventing Australians entering Japan. I say, with respect to the friendly relations that exist between the two countries, that they are as necessary, if not more necessary, to Japan than to England. We know that as things exist at present, Japan must be ready at any time for what may, perhaps, be a death-struggle with Russia, and being in that condition, is she likely to distract her attention from her great natural enemy in order to pick a quarrel with Great Britain on account of something which may happen here in the South Seas, and which is not against her own policy. </para>

If we do our part in this matter, it will be for the interests not only of Australia, but of the English people and of the white races of the world. I feel very strongly upon this question, but I hope I have not expressed myself too strongly, because I did not intend to do so. I have listened with very great care and attention to older and abler politicians than myself. I am fully convinced that they are actuated by as pure and as honorable motives as any one can be, and believe that they are advocating this legislation in the best interests of Australia. I trust I shall be given credit for the same honesty of purpose in the course I take. I believe that if we say now that for all time we shall stop coloured races from coming into Australia, we shall earn the gratitude of those who come after us. I believe that such an Act will be of more importance than any Monroe doctrine, or any declaration of rights, because it will be a declaration that for all time, Australia is to be kept for the white and best races of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Not similar Bills. It may be said, and with truth I think, that while we are seeking to exclude the coloured races we are throwing the door open to all Europeans. I would infinitely rather have the -Japanese come in here than some of the lower class Europeans. I would infinitely rather have our fellow subjects in the north of India come in than I would have the peoples to whom I refer. What have we had lately in New Zealand ? Within the last twelve months the Government tried to shut out as undesirable immigrants a number of Austrians, but they were unable to do so. I happen to know that they have proved to be very undesirable immigrants. I do not wish to mention the nations, but we know that there are people in the South of Europe of whom we do not wish to see too many. As the Bill was introduced by the Government it required the immigrants to be examined in the English language, but in its present form it enables them to be examined practically in their own language, unless - and this is one of the drawbacks - the officer of Customs thinks that they are undesirable immigrants, when he can examine them in any language which he thinks they do not know. </para>

                            <para>- The Government will take good care to have Customs officers who will know more than one language, just as they have Customs officers who know the Chinese and Japanese languages. We must bear in mind that, apart from the kanakas, there are a very large number 'of coloured people - about 70,000 according to the latest information - throughout the Commonwealth. As regards the northern portions of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, we have either to let in under stringent provisions coloured races for the cultivation and development of those territories, or to let them go to waste. </para>

I am prepared to say that if this Bill is passed, before some of the younger senators are much older it will be repealed, and a measure such as I have indicated will be carried. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. I am not going to belittle the white man, but I should be very sorry to attempt to put the white man to work in a climate such as the honorable senator has lived in, and which certainly does not appear to have done him much good. I do not like the construction of this Bill. I should prefer a straightforward method, but we cannot get that, and if I cannot get what I should like I shall take what I can get, knowing that the Bill will receive the Royal assent, and that to a very large extent it will meet the wishes of the electors of the Commonwealth, although I think that their desires are to a very large extent based on an undue fear as to the results of a moderate immigration of the coloured races. While this is nominally a Bill for the establishment of a white Australia, it goes a great deal further than that. It is not only to be a white Australia, but it is to be an Australia with the whites who are here; for I find that an extraordinary sub-clause has been introduced by the labour members in another place, very much to the surprise of all parties. It provides that no one shall be engaged in the old country, not even the relatives of any person, to come out and benefit themselves in Australia without the consent of the Minister, who knows as much about the matter - </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister I had in my mind's eye had as much experience in that line as I have had, he would know a good deal. I am rather astonished that some honorable senator has not referred to this most extraordinary provision. I was under the impression that originally Australia was given primarily for the benefit of the British nation, but we now have a clause saying to the Britishers in the old country - "We do not want any of you." </para>

                            <para>- There are a large number of honest hardworking men in the old country who are not able to save much money, and certainly they are not able to pay their passage-money and to come out of their own volition. It is not desirable or fair to close the whole of the Commonwealth to our fellow subjects of Great Britain. It is distinctly in the interests of the workers of the old country, that if needs be they should receive assistance to come out here. There is an abundance of room for them, and it is adverse to the best interests of the working classes to prevent them from coming here. At the very time when wages were highest here and in New South Wales - I am speaking now of my own knowledge - immigrants were pouring into Australia at the rate of 1,000 a- week I am speaking of 40 years ago. </para>

                            <para>- It will be admitted that the recent progress of Japan has been perfectly marvellous. I desire to point out that it would be a very good thing for the workers of Australia if a few educated Japanese, or educated men of airy race, came here. We know perfectly well that Japanese goods are favoured in Australia, and that young people look for them as wedding presents. I know that whenever a shipload of those goods comes into the State I represent they are quickly sold. It appears to me that those who try to build a wall around Australia to prevent the workmen from competing with any one but themselves will only succeed in diminishing their usefulness and skill ; and that while thinking they are legislating for the benefit of their race, they will only do what will belittle it. </para>

                            <para>- There comes in the whole point of the thing. In the one case you put a simple test - to the Russian, the German, the Japanese, the Chinese, and the Hindoo alike. But under this thimble-rigging Bill you find out first of all what language the immigrant speaks, and then you are careful to test him in a language he does not know. The deceit which the Bill attempts to perpetrate is altogether too thin to mislead anybody. The people against whom it is aimed must see clearly enough that we are trying to do in a round-about way, by a subterfuge, that which for some reason or other we have not the common honesty to do straightforwardly. It appears to me to be as different as hitting a man in the face and sneaking up behind him and kicking him. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and it becomes either the whim of the officer or the sport of passing circumstances. Over most of our courts we have the emblem of the blind goddess holding the scales of justice. But if this Bill is passed, and is administered as we are told it is to be, we shall have to represent the goddess with one eye partially open, and, to complete the caricature, with her tongue in her cheek. It should be the last duty of Parliament to attempt to practise dishonesty in its legislative methods. In their school-books our children are taught by the mottoes they copy that "honesty is the best policy,"but here we are asked to inscribe in our statute-book - " practise deceit when expediency requires it." I can be no party to that proceeding. In passing from that phase of the subject, I must complain of what appears to me to be systematic carelessness in presenting matters to the Senate, the effect of which is to mislead. In the Bill before us, as in other Bills which have been introduced into the Senate, there are marginal notes, the effect of which is to suggest that the clauses against which the notes are placed are exact copies of Acts in force in the different States. In this instance honorable ' senators will find that there is a marginal note giving references to the Natal Act and the New South Wales Act. The only inference to be drawn is that the clauses are practically reproductions of sections of those Acts. As a matter of fact, such is not the case. Not only do I complain of that, but I venture to say that the Vice-President of the Executive Council was himself, consciously or unconsciously, misleading the Senate when he asked us to believe that the education test imposed by this Bill, is the education test inforced in other States. I say that this test is not inforced anywhere. </para>

I repeat that the distinction is that in the one case the Bill does not lay down any general principle which any applicant for admission can ascertain and follow, but leaves it to the option of a Customs officer - which means the Government - to settle what shall be the particular test applied ; whereas in the other cases the applicant for admission has the selection of the language in which he shall be examined. Under this Bill, if it is found that an applicant for admission is proficient in one European language, the Government may examine him in another. </para>

                            <para>- I object to it because, to use a term which I employed just now, it is simply a piece of thimble-rigging, which may be worthy of the race-course, but is altogether unworthy of the Parliament of a great country. Let us lay down , a principle embodying what we propose to do, but not say to a man - " You may come here knowing two or three European languages, but we will still trip you up, because we will examine you in a language which you do not know." It is in this respect that the chief defect of this Bill consists. What we desire to do is to avoid invidious distinctions, and giving offence to Eastern people. Yet we propose to make the most invidious distinction possible. I have yet to learn that Mr. Chamberlain approves of the method proposed by this Bill. I do not believe that the Imperial authorities will pass the measure with this objectionable clause in it. I do not think they will have a chance of doing so ; but if this Senate should give them a chance, I feel certain that, for the reasons I have mentioned, and for the reasons which Mr. Chamberlain has given, the King's Ministers will decline to advise him to give his assent to it. The whole foundation of the objection to the education test here proposed, is that it will make a distinction against people with whom the Imperial Government is in friendly alliance. </para>

                        <para>- Speaking at so late a stage of the debate one cannot help but feel a little embarrassed, by reason of the fact that, whether from the stand-point of one side or the other it is necessary to some extent at least, to repeat or emphasize the arguments used by earlier speakers. I think the Senate may. be congratulated on the high standard of the speeches delivered on this occasion; and a most excellent lead was given in that respect by the able and comprehensive speech of the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I feel, personally, a very considerable amount of interest in this question. It revives in my mind many of the fights of some three, four., or five years ago, when it became my duty, as the member of a Government administering the department of immigration and emigration, to introduce on behalf of that </para>

This is a- matter-as to which the Imperial Government has some, concern. According to- my view; in this- Bill the Ministry have substantially followed the genera] education test and* the model of the Natal Act ; but if they have gone beyond that model they have simply made it more severe. I submit that, from- my honorable friend's stand-point, he cannot justly and reasonably object to. the Bill from that point of view. Now, I want to point out, as showing the justification of the Government for what they have done, that they had to deal with a sympathetic Colonial- Secretary, who- has indicated conclusively that he has determined to make the restriction effective if' this Bill will not do so.

                            <para>- According to the terms oi the Bill, the officer can demand that the immigrant shall write out 50 words in any European language. Of course the passage will be varied. I suppose that some honorable senators sympathize with the horror and indignation exhibited by Senators Harney and Millen with regard to the "subterfuge" which it is said is attempted by this Bill. The English vocabulary was almost exhausted by them in their expressions of alarm. They .said that the Bill was "a fraud"; that it was a "species of organized dissimulation"; that it was a piece of " chicanery " ; and all sorts of other objectionable phrases were used about it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is anything of the kind. Honorable senators must realize the position of affairs. We, as a part of the British Empire, are endeavouring to get a measure which will restrict the influx of Asiatic peoples. The Imperial Government have to give their assent to that measure before it can be passed. They say, therefore, that so far as concerns anything appearing upon the face of our measure, we must not do anything that will unnecessarily embarrass the Imperial Government. That is the first answer to honorable senators opposite. The second is that we have to administer the measure ourselves. The Imperial Government does not attempt in any shape or form to interfere with or dictate to us as to how we shall administer the Bill. They agree with us as to what the form of words shall be on the face of the measure as it goes to the world ; they know what our object is, and sympathize with it ; they say, "We will assent to this particular form of Bill, and you, enjoying responsible government, can administer it just exactly as you like." The administration of the measure is part and parcel of the form of government that we enjoy. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing to prevent Asiatics going to England. But I want my honorable friend to distinguish. Our relations with the British Empire require that we shall agree with the Imperial Government as to the form this legislation will take. They only presume to discuss and settle what that form shall be. Once having secured that form, then it is for us, enjoying responsible Government, to act within the limits of the statute, as so assented to. I venture to say that, having the freedom of administration such as we possess in this connexion, we can administer it according to our own ideas. This Parliament and the Commonwealth generally would resent any attempt at dictation on the part of the Imperial Government as to the way in which we shall administer our own affairs. </para>

As loyal subjects, we feel that we have a positive duty in that connexion. When we pass a law we have to consider how it will affect the Empire internally and externally. We feel that the Imperial Government have a right to some voice in the matter. From an internal stand-point the Imperial Government have said that they are trustees for the Empire. They have pointed out that the Empire includes not only the Australian colonies, but likewise the Indian possessions, and that as trustees for the Empire they do not consider that they should assent to a measure which on the face of it appears to be directed against our Indian fellow subjects. (Consequently they urge, from this sentimental stand-point, that some consideration should be given to their wishes. Then, from the external point of view, they say that the colour line is objectionable if applied on the face of the Bill to friendly powers. If there is a reasonable prospect of the proposals of the Government - which are at least congenial to the Imperial authorities - being passed, why should we insist upon a measure which we know will be objectionable to them. This is a matter to which we should give careful consideration, having due regard to all surrounding circumstances. I hope that honorable senators will </para>

I say, therefore, let us not use language which can only irritate by its violence, and which can serve no good purpose. We have been told by several honorable senators that if the Bill is passed in the form in which I wish to see it passed, it will be vetoed by the British Government. We are warned of what has taken place in Queensland, where the Imperial Government have vetoed the Sugar Works Guarantee Act. But the principle embodied in that Act, which was passed last year, is not new. It has been the policy of Queensland for nearly 20 years. If any change has taken place in regard to it, that change has been in the Colonial Office, and not on the part of the Parliament of Queensland. There are, upon the statute-book of that State, numbers of other Acts embodying the same principle. There is, for instance, the Mineral Land Act of 1882, which, in part (3), section (7), contains the following provision - </para>

                            <para>- I know the honorable senator's opinion well enough. I say the Japanese nation is a first-class power. They have a splendid army, and a navy equal to that of a first-class power. Their ships of war are fitted with the latest improvements, and manned by men who know how to work them. They are low-set, strong, muscular people; with pluck enough to face any enemy in the world, and we must not treat the Japanese as though they were not fit to be admitted into our country. Another matter for consideration is this : There is a large number of British people settled in Japan at the present time. English, Irish, Scotch, and Australians are established in business in Japan and competing with her own people in all classes of business. They have liberty there to buy property, build houses, and form their own clubs. They have every liberty and freedom that they would have in Australia. It is the same in China. If honorable senators will go to Canton and Shanghai, they will find British people competing with the Chinese in every class of business. Why should not these people have just as much right to prevent our people from going to their country as we have to prevent them coming here ? </para>

                            <para>- Do we not object to it? If anything of the kind were attempted, the first thing we should do would be to urge upon the Imperial Government, if necessary, to use force of arms to compel them to let us go to their country and do what we liked there. We find a British company owning steamers trading in the rivers there. They monopolise the river trade with their steamers, on which the only white people employed are the captains and officers, because they are manned by coloured crews. We do as we like in the countries belonging to these people, but we say that they must not come near us at all. It is selfish and inconsistent, but it would not appear so selfish and inconsistent if we were contented to remain as we are ourselves. On the contrary, we find that we are now reaching out for more territory. There is New Guinea, which is the largest island in the world with the exception of Australia, and is inhabited by brown Polynesians. At the present time the British and the Germans control those people, but we are now proposing to take over the British possessions in that island, and how are we going to treat those people ? We are making the British portion of New Guinea a part of our own country, and are we not going to allow those people to come to their own country to earn a living ? </para>

                            <para>- They are coming across now to the north of Queensland. They appreciate the treatment they receive there, and the opportunities of earning regular wages, and they say they are proud and pleased to belong to the new nation. I look upon the proposal as one for an extension of coloured labour in the sugar plantations in the north. They cannot possibly do any injury to the white population, but will be most valuable and useful in making a great industry profitable that would otherwise languish and die out. We shall be able to develop the richest part of our territory with our own people, otherwise it would remain a waste and a wilderness for ever. No white men will ever develop the north except with the assistance of people of that class. I have been 40 years in the tropics - before some honorable senators were born - and I know what it means. With the step the Commonwealth Government is now taking we shall be able to grow the whole of the sugar grown in the Commonwealth with our own people, and shall not require to send away £1,500,000 a year to buy sugar grown by black labour under conditions that we would not tolerate in our own country. We shall not require to buy sugar grown by black labour receiving wages at the rate of 4d. and 6d. per day. That is what the result would be if we are to carry out this proposal for a " white Australia." The " white Australia " has become a ridiculous cry, and nothing else. I say without hesitation that it is only a political cry, and I do not know what some honorable senators will do if we propose to grow our sugar with our own people in this way, and take this cry away from them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know where they will get it. At the present time there are 50,000 Australian native blacks in the tropics, and they are not going to be exterminated in the same way as the tribes in the south. Some of them are employed at the present time on sugar plantations on the Johnstone River and some other northern places, and it is found that when they are well fed and taken care of they develop into good workers. The number of them employed on the sugar plantations will increase year by year. There are 50,000 of them there, and what are we going to do with our "white Australia " when they are employed? We cannot get rid of our own people, and we cannot get rid of the natives of New Guinea, because we are are going to annex them, and they will form a part of our own population. Surely we shall not prevent them from earning a living in their own country? I do not wish to take up the time of the House further. I suppose we shall have this discussion over and over again. I do not believe in the Bill, but I believe less in the amendment proposed. I hope we shall have a better Bill before it gets through committee than it is at the present time. </para>

                            <para>- I was afraid the honorable and learned senator would not consent, and I shall therefore go on speaking. Although he has refused what I think was a reasonable request, I shall begin my speech by saying that I agree heartily with the honorable and learned senator in his statement that this is a measure of the greatest importance. I do not suppose any one will gainsay that for a moment. All other matters which we have discussed in the Senate seem to be of mere municipal importance compared with the Bill before us. It is the first Bill introduced into this Chamber which has a distinctly international aspect. It is obviously, therefore, a Bill which demands from every honorable senator the most serious consideration. I have recognised clearly, as I suppose every honorable senator has done, that this debate on the second reading has practically been a committee debate on clause 4. I have sometimes wondered at the assumption which seems to be obvious in the mind of every speaker that we should take it for granted that every one here is perfectly satisfied in his own mind that the immediate necessity for a white Australia has arisen ; I use the term "white Australia" because its connotation is known to all of us. So far as my constituents are concerned I stand here perfectly free to vote as I like ; I stand here committed to nothing, but I stand here committed to regard my own self-respect and to vote as I think best on the measure. I have had to look round for reasons which will abundantly justify me in acceding either to the measure as it is presented by the Government, or to the measure as it may be amended. I remember that in the debate on the address in reply I, as every other honorable senator, to a certain extent touched on this question. I then said, and I repeat, that on the racial side I cannot understand any man in Australia having any doubt. It appeals to us with the very greatest force, if we consider for one moment that we have any pride in our race. I know that there are some persons to whom this white Australia means something more than an escape from racial degradation. I assume that we are all satisfied that we must avoid the immigration of aliens on. that ground. But I am prepared to go further. My views on another matter, which I hope to hear discussed only when we come to it, are well known. But on the industrial side also I recognise freely and frankly that we are abundantly justified in preventing our own workmen from having to endure competition which is unfair. I believe that we are abundantly justified in refusing to plunge our own workmen into competition with any race whose methods of life and notions of civilization are so much inferior to our own. Ibr these reasons, I think that this demand for a white Australia is well made. There have been honorable senators who have described it occasionally as hysterical and occasionally as premature. Now, the first legislation on this matter in the Australian colonies took place in 1857. Any legislation which was inaugurated so long ago as nearly 50 years is scarcely legislation which we can call hysterical. Nor, on the other hand, since we are dealing with it now in a Federal Parliament, can it be said to be previous, when it is nearly 50 years since it was first started. This demand for a white Australia has a better basis, and it is contained in our Constitution Act. It was well debated when the Constitution was being framed. There are no stronger passages in our well-known section 51 than those which relate to alien immigration. They are the very basis of this cry. They give to this Parliament full power to deal with the people of any race other than the aboriginal race of any State, with immigration and emigration, with the influx of criminals, and with external affairs. Seeing that we have that warranty in our Constitution, for any honorable senator to say that this cry is previous or hysterical is to say a thing which cannot be justified by any evidence. I have felt it necessary to thus briefly mention the reasons for my attitude with regard to this question. "We have gone on the assumption that everyone wants the Bill, but, practically speaking, every honorable senator has omitted to say why. I suppose if we are to consider this question in the proper order of time we ought next to consider the nationalities that are to be affected. What are they ? Those nations which are chiefly affected, and about whose treatment honorable senators find the greatest difficulty in making up their minds are, practically speaking, the Japanese and the subjects of the Indian Empire. There is no nation in this year which more compels the admiration of every man of us than the Japanese. They stand out in this year as a single instance of an Eastern nation which has risen superior to all its environments and all its traditions. They are the one nation in the history of this world who have overcome that Oriental sloth which in all past centuries has been a sufficient drag on the rest of Asia, and Africa, and the whole of the world which may be described as Oriental.. Peeling as I do about the Japanese I may be asked how I can justify their exclusion by any means. Much as we deservedly admire the Japanese we all of us collectively and individually have this feeling : that we cannot marry with them or give in marriage with them. I do not think there is an honorable senator, no matter what his feelings are, who would not recognize that position as inevitable. I do not ask that it should be brought home personally to him, but I do say that were it once brought home personally to him he would say to th&amp; Japanese - "We cannot marry with you, and we cannot give in marriage with you." </para>

                            <para>- Of course. I believe he will be able to shut out any coloured man, even if he is destitute of a knowledge of any foreign language. My opinion of the methods of the Government in regard to this educational test is such that I should not be in the least surprised if a Customhouse official were appointed to exercise this test who did not know any language but his own, and that, possibly, but indifferently. I am prepared to learn that to such an extent of foolery could this Government go, once it obtains the provision in regard to the educational test, that the Custom-house official might say to a would-be immigrant - " Write out 50 words in Russian," and that if the would-be immigrant wrote them out in the best Russian ever written the official would reply - " That is no good, you cannot come in." If it is thought that I am exaggerating the position - and apparently the Vice-President thinks so - I will again ask how is the Custom-house officer going to decide between those who are going to come in, although they have black faces, and those who are to be kept out ? It will be a most interesting operation. The only regret that I have that this Bill will not come into operation in its present form - as I hope it will not - is that we shall not have a chance of observing its administration. </para>
