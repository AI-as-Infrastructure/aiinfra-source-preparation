                        <para>- I quite believe that.' In labour circles there has been considerable discussion and criticism concerning the want of. action, seeing that action was so promptly taken in the local Parliament over a matter which was, in my opinion, of much less importance than that we are dealing with; I know that the press is a great and mighty institution, and that its freedom should not be lightly interfered with. It may be said that I am placing myself in an inconsistent position in taking any action affecting that so-called freedom, and in speaking on behalf of royalty, being a labour member ; because amongst many people labour members are not supposed to be so intensely loyal as other Members of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- It is only a supposition ; it is not true. If the libel of which I complain had been published concerning the present King, I have no doubt that attention would have been directed to it sooner. But it is not so much on the | individual as on the office that this libel is perpetrated ; and it is in that aspect that the subject is important. There is an old adage which says - "Long live the King." I take that to mean that the office never dies, and tin insult to that office, either in this or any other age, is offensive. We have been also told that the King is in a position in which he cannot defend himself against foul libels. If that be true of a living King, then a dead King is surely at a still greater disadvantage ? </para>

                    ANIFORTH SMITH (Western Australia), in reply. - Considering the speeches which have been made upon this motion, I cannot but feel pleased that the general opinion of the Senate is in accord with its object. If we take the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, we find him declaring that he is in heartiest sympathy with the desire to have a large area. He also indorses my contention when he says that if the territory is such that we shall have to pay for it, then, however desirable it may be to have a large area, our choice will be more or less restricted by considerations of cost. In other words, if we choose a capital where there is much population - where land is valuable - we must necessarily restrict the area of the territory because of the enormous cost. So that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is in accord with this motion.
                    in his remarks, said that the real questions to be decided before we selected the capital are those of tenure and area. Those were the two conditions that I put -forward.
                    said that the first question to be considered is: Shall we acquire the fee simple of the whole territory ? Later on he said that one of the first things we should decide is the area which it is desirable to acquire, and that, to a very large extent, depends upon how we intend to deal with the territory.
                    has re-echoed the remarks I have made, and yet, on a previous occasion, when
                    submitted a proposition as to the conditions upon which the federal territory should be held, he got up and asked that the motion should be withdrawn. Now, when I submit a proposal relating to the area of the federal capital site,
                    beseeches me to adopt the same course, although he said in his speech that the two questions to be decided before we selected the capital were those of tenure and area. We want to give the Government an idea as to what the opinion of the Senate is with regard to tenure and area. If the Government introduce a Bill without knowing what the opinion of this Chamber is, they may bring in a measure for the acquisition of a very restricted area.

He also expressed a burning desire, at the beginning of this session, that the capital should be established as soon as possible. I believe it is his idea that the capital should be established, and that we should be sitting in New South Wales, in about five years' time. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I say, in reply, that the question when we establish our capital evidently rests, not with New South Wales, but with the Federal Parliament ; and if New South Wales will not allow us to have a site which we are willing to accept, we will not accept any site at all. Therefore, the argument cuts both ways. We should endeavour to choose a site where there is as small a population as possible, consistent with the fact that it is suitable in every way for a federal capital. There are many tilings to take into consideration in fixing a site. The matter is of such importance that the Government would do well to appoint some experts to consider various sites, first giving them some definite lines to go upon, such as I have endeavoured to outline. Then we can go and inspect those sites as soon as possible. But if there are 30 or 40 sites to inspect, and we are to spend from Friday to Wednesday inspecting them, at the rate of one a week, we shall be travelling over New South Wales for the next twelve months. Such a proposal amounts to an absurdity. </para>

                        <para>- That corroborates what I have said, that we cannot take notice of the suggested sites if we wish to have a large area. The objection was raised by one senator who has spoken that it would cost a large amount of money to buy out private people. There is a large amount of valuable land of which the fee-simple is held by private individuals, but even if such land has to be bought by the Commonwealth Government, it is advisable to buy a large area. If we buy the land at its fair value, we can obtain the money for the purpose at 3 or 3^ per cent. If that can be done, will honorable senators say that the rental we shall obtain for the land, at the increased value which will be given to it when the federal capital is established, will not be so great that we shall make ' a profit on the transaction </para>

                    <para>- I have very little to say with regard to the motion. I at once declare my antagonism to it. I do so for the simple reason that the Federal Convention thoroughly discussed the matter, and came into the conclusion, I presume, that it would be extremely unwise to put such a provision to the Constitution, because it would largely restrict the choice of candidates for the Federal Parliament. I know that a great many- very able gentlemen would have a great injustice done to them if they were debarred from accepting offices of profit under the Crown, if such appointments were offered to them. I am glad to say that we have in our midst some very able members of the legal profession, who would adorn any bench, and I should be extremely sorry to do anything that would deprive the Commonwealth of their services in such offices'. Therefore, I oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>- The motion is of some importance, but I do not regard it as being democratic in any sense of the word. Quite the contrary j and, therefore, I am not in favour of passing it. If this resolution becomes law, no Member of Parliament could be appointed to any office of profit under the Crown, nor could he be so appointed within twelve months of his ceasing to be a member. This provision, in my opinion, is not only too drastic and restrictive, but it is undemocratic. The honorable senator in introducing the motion said very truly that the position of a Member of Parliament is a most honorable one. The making of the laws of the country, the moulding of the Constitution under which the people are to live, form work which is onerous as well as honorable. The position of a Member of Parliament is certainly one of great trust and one of great responsibility. That being so, I think we should guard as far as we can the rights and privileges of honorable members, and see that they are not restricted from taking any office to which their country may call them, and for which they may be eminently fitted. I am quite sure that I fully echo the sentiments of every honorable senator in regard to the honorable position which Members of Parliament occupy. In advancing reasons for bringing forward the motion, the honorable senator said that the Federal Government would shortly have to make some very important appointments, and that the vacant offices should be filled by the very best men. Is it not just possible that the most capable men for some of these positions may occupy seats in either House of Parliament? If this resolution is carried, and is embedded in the statute law of the country, the right arm of the Government will be paralyzed, and it will be absolutely impossible for them to appoint a Member of Parliament to any of these positions. In this enlightened age is that the line in which democracy is supposed to run ? Surely we have not arrived at a period when it is necessary to pass such restrictive laws? Although bad appointments may have been made in the past, is that any reason why we should carry such a motion as this? After calm deliberation, are we to prevent the Government from selecting persons for offices irrespective of whether they occupy seats in this Parliament or not ? The honorable senator said that an unscrupulous Federal Ministry might appoint to a lucrative position some powerful and skilful opponent whom they wished to get out of the way. Who is the honorable senator aiming at ? It is well to be plain on this question. In which House does this powerful opponent exist that the Government of the day may wish to get rid of? </para>

                        <para>- I think the Government should have a perfectly free hand in making these appointments ; that they should be able to select officers for these positions irrespective of whether they may happen to be Members of Parliament or not, provided of course that they possess the necessary qualifications. It is said that in the past appointments have been made from the ranks of Members of Parliament, which were nothing short of a scandal. That is true. If it were necessary to go into details and to single out cases, I dare say I could cite one appointment which was made in my own State, and was by no means creditable either to the person who received it or to the Government who made it. Doubtless similar appointments have been made in other States, but have not such appointments been made of others than Members of Parliament ? </para>

                        <para>- To say that Parliament consists largely of unscrupulous persons is a serious reflection on each one of us. The honorable senator asserted that when Members of Parliament were seeking the suffrages of the electors they ought to have said that they were likely to accept appointments if. they were offered to them. I do not think it was necessary. I do not know that any candidate was asked to say - " If you intrust me for a term with the responsibility of making the laws, I will give you my word of honour that I shall not accept office." I was never asked to do so. This is a most serious attempt to restrict the rights of the people, aud more particularly the rights of Members of Parliament. I believe some doubtful appointments have been made in "Western Australia, but I shall not allude to that, because it is a matter with which I have not much concern. </para>

                        <para>- I have said so, and if it were necessary to give details I could point to one specific case of rather a serious nature. I have said that these appointments are not merely confined to Members of Parliament, but sometimes very doubtful appointments are made of persons who are not Members of Parliament. Practically, there is. less danger in the appointment of Members of Parliament, because they are limited in number, than in the appointment of persons outside, who are practically unlimited. There is a greater liability, too, of unscrupulous Governments appointing unscrupulous persons who are not Members of Parliament to hold positions. </para>

                        <para>- I would apply it to nobody: I am a democrat, believing in the broad principles of democracy, and that a person should be chosen to fill the position for which providence and his training have best fitted him. The honorable senator said that in one case a capable and efficient critic of the Government in the New South Wales- Assembly was appointed,, and for years was lost to. the public life of the State. That is one of the instances cited for showing the necessity for carrying this resolution, and to induce the Senate to adopt it. I think I have some little knowledge of the person in question, but I will not go into the matter. I hope we shall have a few of these cases cited by the honorable senator when he comes to reply. Certainly, it is to be regretted that unscrupulous appointments are made, but when it is suggested that the Member of Parliament who will be asked to fill a position, is a. powerful "and skilful debater, it should be remembered that such a. man ought to be well able to protect himself, and we must remember he is not bound to accept office. If he has the power and skill referred to by the honorable senator, he is but armed, in my judgment, with greater powers of resistance. If there was any compulsion, and a person had to take office, it would be another matter. It seems to me to be suggested by implication that every Member of Parliament is hungering and thirsting for office, merely waiting until the bait is thrown down, and then he will swallow it. I absolutely and emphatically repudiate the charge. I have been for many years in Parliament, taking part in the public life of the country in which I live, and I have never to this hour sought or cringed or crawled for office. I have never been hungry or thirsty for office, nor am I to-day. So long as I possess any little ability, and enjoy the confidence of the people who send me here, or to any other place of responsibility and trust, I hope I shall have sufficient power of resistance not to swallow these little baits even though they may be thrown down as numerously as some honorable senators suggest. The honorable senator says we should put it beyond the power of any leader of a Government to put temptation in the way of puny Members of Parliament who are sent here from different States by a free people, from a free platform, and through a free press. The people believe that the persons sent here are those most capable of representing their desires, instincts, and aspirations in this House. But, no-! Poor, weakly Members of Parliament are not able to protect themselves, and a motion like this is requited to-take temptation out of their way, and to prevent them from, swallowing those little crumbs thrown down from time to time by an unscrupulous Government ! It is a marvel, in this enlightened age, that such a provision as this should be considered necessary. I could understand keeping temptation out of the way of children - the temptation to betting or cigarette smoking : but I cannot understand that it should be considered necessary to keep temptation out of the way of Members of Parliament by carrying such a resolution as this, in this enlightened age. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose so, but I may be pardoned for saying, in reply, that there is just a possibility that an offer might come as readily this way as in the way of the honorable senator opposite. If I should be so insignificant as not to be thought of, it is perhaps so much the better for me, as I stand in the happy position that I am not likely to be tempted. The honorable senator says it would be a calamity if some gentlemen now occupying places in both Houses of the Federal Parliament were to accept, such offices. Who are these gentlemen ? We were told of the danger it might be to some future Parliament, but by implication the reference is also to the present Parliament. Who are these gentlemen ? Let us single out two or three to begin with, because I . think it is just as well to be plain on the question, and I intend to be plain. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter. I have no doubt Lord Russell took the position where he thought he could serve his country best. That is my opinion, knowing the life of Chief Justice Russell for many years before he entered Parliament, and during the years he was in Parliament. These gentlemen present at any rate two instances where prominent politicians were successful in filling high offices, and numerous others might be cited in England, Ireland, and Scotland. Further instances are not necessary, but let us take the Irish bench, some of the brightest ornaments of which were for years extremely active politicians. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that if this motion were passed a Bill would have to be introduced in order to give effect to it, and I think that any such legislation would be a mistake, as it would aim a serious blow at the liberties of the people, and would prevent them from choosing the most suitable men for the highest positions in the community. Furthermore, it would have the effect of stifling all laudable ambition, and would prevent men from acquiring that knowledge which is necessary to fit them for the most responsible offices. It would make it impossible for men who, by their experience and their activity in ' public life, have won the confidence of the community - such, men as the Attorney-General and the Minister for Trade and Customs - to be placed in such positions as those of Judges or High Commissioners to represent the Commonwealth in London. One of the worst features of the proposal is that it would prevent not only the Commonwealth but also the States from obtaining the services of some of those who might be regarded as most eligible for any position of importance. I will record my vote against the motion. </para>

                    (Queensland), in reply. - I am sure I sympathize with those honorable senators who, through this motion of mine, have been subjected to such a lot of sickening flattery this morning. I do not at all deny that the motion is directed against certain very able men in this and in another Chamber. I am not prepared to name these gentlemen, as I do not want to cause any unpleasantness. I should like to ask why, if this motion is so objectionable, the principle contained in it should find a place in the Victorian Constitution? How is it that the Parliament of Victoria embodied in its constitution a provision to prevent Members of Parliament from accepting positions at the hands of the Ministry of the day ?

                        <para>- I accept the honorable and learned senator's denial. This motion is not directed solely at the lawyers who happen to be Members of Parliament. It is a comprehensive proposal, and covers all Members of Parliament. It refers to positions in the civil service as well as on the bench. I dare say it will be proposed to appoint some Members of Parliament who are not lawyers to seats on the Inter-State Commission. That would be very wrong. Outside our Legislative chambers there are men of sufficient capacity and honesty of purpose to fill those positions without selecting Members of Parliament. I regard these political appointments as not only deleterious to the efficient carrying on of the public service, but also as reflecting on Members of Parliament themselves ; and I support the opinion of those members of the Federal Convention who at that time were so full of patriotism and so anxious to do the best for the Commonwealth in their desire to prevent political appointments being made. </para>

                    <para>. - I should like to say a few words of general explanation as to Part 7 of the Bill, upon which we are now entering) not with a view of disarming criticism, but to prevent unnecessary repetitions upon any of the clauses. These clauses are, in the main, taken from the Electric Lighting Acts of Great Britain, passed in 1882 and 1888. Those Acts recognise that wherever electricity is largely used in any town, it is necessary that there should be some general control ling power over the wires. In Great Britain that duty is undertaken by the Board of Trade, which has authority over the use of electricity in towns and issues licences to corporate bodies or private companies, giving them power to put up wires and laying down the regulations which must be observed. The Board of Trade is very careful indeed to protect the rights and privileges of the Post and . Telegraph department. In the Commonwealth we have no body similar to the Board of Trade, and it has been considered desirable in nearly all the States where electricity is largely used that the controlling authority should rest with the Post and Telegraph department. There is great reason for that. The Post and Telegraph department has a whole network of telephone and telegraph lines which in themselves are comparatively harmless, because they carry a very weak current of electricity, but the companies or corporate bodies which use electricity for lighting or motive purposes have wires which carry a tremendously strong current. If an accident hap-' pens, and those lines break and fall across a telephone wire, the current of electricity is communicated to the delicate mechanism of switch-boards and instruments, thereby doing a great amount of injury, as well as endangering life and private property. Primarily the reason why the department is charged, with the control' of electric wires is that it is necessary that it shall have full power to protect its own apparatus and wires. Incidentally also the department is charged with the protection of life and property, because, as I have already indicated, an accident happening to a wire erected for lighting and motive "purposes might have the effect of destroying telephones and wrecking the most expensive switch-board, and might also do injury to life and limb. These are the reasons why the power should be put into the hands of the department. </para>

                        <para>- The department represents the public really, and has to protect a very important system, which exists for the public convenience. I should like honorable senators, in discussing this part of the Bill, to bear in mind that there is no question of rivalry here. During the discussion of the postal portion of the Bill I had to point out that it was necessary for the post-office to be protected in its monopoly against rival trading firms. In this case nothing of the kind arises, because there is no rivalry whatever. The Post and Telegraph department does not manufacture and distribute electricity for lighting and motive purposes. The only desire that can exist in the department is to see that its wires are protected, so that the business of the department may be carried on, and the public interest conserved. Clause 136 is in nearly the same words as the corresponding section in the British Act, and the same remark applies to clause 137. </para>

                    <para>- I am not quite sure whether an important point is not involved in this clause, as also in one or two subsequent provisions. Where there is an existing electric wire for lighting purposes the rights of the owner are affected by the clause. All other lines practically belong to the Government, but where there is an electric line in existence which has been erected necessarily with the consent of the authorities, it is only fair that if that wire has to be disturbed the expense of the alteration should be borne by the department. In Victoria, before any electric wire can be erected by a private person an order has to be obtained from the Postmaster-General. If subsequently the Postmaster-General steps in and requires to erect telegraph lines for the department, and the two lines interfere with one another, and it becomes necessary to alter the position of the electric light wire, it is only just that the expense of that alteration should fall, not upon the private company or the individual, but upon the Commonwealth Government. I have already mentioned this matter to the Postmaster-General, and we have turned up the English Act of 1888 - the 51st and 52nd of Vic, chapter 12, section 4. There it is provided practically that the expense shall fall upon the Government. It is also provided in the Victorian Electric Lighting and Power Act, No. 1413, section 36 -  </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General may say that in the interest of the Commonwealth it is necessary that a telegraph line shall be put up within two or three feet of an existing line erected for lighting purposes. It will then be absolutely necessary that the line for electric lighting shall be removed. In that case it is only just that the cost of the alteration should fall upon the Commonwealth and not upon the individual owner of the line. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria)-It appears to me that something more than the simple statement contained in this clause will be necessary in regard to the question of arbitration. In . the Acts of most of the States there are provisions as to the way in which an arbitration shall be dealt with in case of either side refusing to appoint arbitrators. There is nothing of that kind in this clause, and I can only suggest that either it should refer to some existing Act, or that a provision similar to that which I have stated should be made in the clause. An Arbitration Bill may not be passed this' session, and in the meantime difficulties may arise requiring a reference to arbitration. In that event how would they be met?

                    <para>- I do not think that is necessary, although, of course, the suggestion is worthy of attention. I would point out that in every State at the present time there exist arbitration laws ; and I think if this clause is amended in such a way as to read that wherever a matter is by this Act to be settled by arbitration it shall be referred to arbitration in accordance with the law of the State in which the dispute arises, that will meet the difficulty. </para>

                    <para>- This clause gives the Postmaster-General power to make contracts. There must be two parties to a contract, and therefore it seems to me that the last lines of the clause relating to the imposition of terms are somewhat contradictory. If the Postmaster-General makes a contract with some one else, it must be a mutual arrangement. The clause, however, gives the Postmaster-General power to enforce his will upon a dissenting party. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; it is one of the conditions of such contracts. I believe , the amendment which I now propose expresses the desires of the bulk of the people of Australia. It represents the sentiment which has been declared by the people of the .Commonwealth through their representatives in both Houses, and I think, therefore, that it truly interprets the will of the people. Moreover, it is an adjunct to the expressed will of the people that finds a place in two Bills which, I believe, have already been introduced by the Government in the other House. Another point which we should consider is that the amendment proposes what is only fair to those shipping companies that have for many years been carrying mails, for the various States, on vessels manned by white crews. T have endeavoured to get an expression of opinion from some of these companies,, but they are somewhat reticent in the matter.. They do not wish to have the name of their company or their manager brought into our discussion. But I have this guarantee, that large companies, who have adopted the plan of manning their vessels by white crews, have found no difficulty from the financial stand-point. They hint that there has been some difficulty occasionally in getting crews to man ships with the regularity which is. necessary. I have endeavoured to get full data, but I have failed. I am very anxious, to. ascertain if there is any difficulty in getting white men to man vessels, and to run them with that regularity which the people expect, because that is alleged as one of the reasons why black men are employed on them. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I have been able to gather, between two and three black men are employed to every white man. It is not only in accordance with the wishes, of the people of Australia, but it is fair - seeing that the one large company to which I have referred, carried merchandise - that all the companies should in this respect be placed on an equal footing. It is only fair to our own kith and kin - to the people of Australia, who profess to believe in this great principle - that white men should be employed in manning the ships that carry our mails. I wish here to emphasize a point which I made in my speech on the second reading. I refer to the- contingencies which may arise, now that the Commonwealth has entered into the family of nations. When Great Britain becomes involved in a war with some big power or powers, these ships generally will be employed for defensive and, perhaps, for offensive purposes. And, therefore, it is only reasonable and fair, I submit, that they should be manned by white men. </para>

The effect of this contract is that the steamers are bound to start at a certain time, to call at certain ports, to go at a certain rate of speed, and to deliver the mails at certain times. But, quite apart from that, we can put our. mails on the steamers and compel them to cany mail matter at certain fixed rates. </para>

It is said that it is a question of Imperial concern, and that phrase finds considerable favour with some sections of the community. We must remember that this question is attracting attention not only in ..Australia, but in the British Parliament. I propose to read a few extracts from a debate on this very subject in the House of Commons, where I believe it is discussed every time the question of mail contracts arises.

                    has raised a very important question indeed, and I say, with all respect to my honorable friend,
                    that it cannot be dealt with in the offhand way which he seems to believe possible. As a matter of policy, taking the larger view of it, I think we are all agreed that wherever it is possible we should see that encouragement is given to the employment of British seamen on British ships. On precisely the same principle I say that wherever possible white men should be employed on British ships.

                        <para>- We do in parts of the world where only coloured men can be employed. But that is no reason why we should employ coloured men in Australia. That is the key of the policy of a white Australia - that as far as possible, and wherever possible, white men should be employed. Therefore, as far as the Government have control over any mail contracts, it will be their policy to see that there is a stipulation that only white men shall be employed on board the ships which carry the mails. There is no reason why that should not be done. Upon the boats owned by a great and powerful company trading with Australia, namely the Orient Company, we all know that only white men are employed. That company has canned on its business with great success. </para>

                        <para>- It may be so, and there is no difficulty in applying the principle to the Inter-State mails. But look at the position of the P. and O. Company. It has entered into a contract with the British Government for the carriage of mails to certain British States and possessions. One' of the company's contracts is for the carriage of mails to British possessions in these seas. The Governments of the different States pay a subsidy to the company. Whether they pay it directly to the British Government or to the P. and O. Company I am not aware at present, but the contracting party is the British Government. It is impossible that in a matter of that kind any statutory power or duty imposed upon the Postmaster -General can be effectually exercised. We cannot expect a contract made by the British Government affecting a large number of British possessions, in which different conditions prevail, to be altered to suit the particular requirements and wishes of a Postal Act of the Commonwealth. Therefore, dealing with the question in a practical way, I say that it is impossible to apply this principle. In any particular case where we have the sole controlling power the Government are quite willing to apply the principle. It comes to a question of whether this is a. matter that should be left as a question of policy to the Government, or whether Parliament is to put a cast-iron direction in an Act of Parliament which will prevent the Postmaster-General from making any contract that does not contain this particular stipulation. If the amendment is carried it will be mandatory that in all such contracts there shall be inserted a stipulation that the crew shall be white men. All lawyers will agree with me that if that duty . is imposed upon the Postmaster - General, and that authority is given to him, he will be bound to make that stipulation in the contracts ; and if he did not make it, I doubt very much- whether the contract would be a good one. Is it right that the Postmaster-General, who will have to deal not only with Inter-State contracts, but with contracts in which he shares with the British Government in subsidizing companies for possibly the delivery of mails to some islands in the Pacific - with which our trade will grow in time - should have his- hands tied, so that he cannot make a contract with the companies which employ black labour. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly ; any coloured person might vitiate the contract. I draw a clear line of distinction between laying it down as a matter of policy, the performance of which will be watched by Parliament, that wherever it is possible and practicable white men only shall be employed, and placing a mandate upon the Postmaster-General that he shall enter into no contract whatever for the carriage of mails unless there is this stipulation in it. What danger is there in leaving it to the Government to cany out this policy wherever it is possible ? Parliament is entitled to know, and will know from public documents, the terms of every contract entered into by the Commonwealth Government with regard to the carriage of mails. These contracts can be laid on the tables of both Houses of Parliament. Whenever it is seen that the -policy of making such a stipulation in contracts where it can be done, is departed from, the Government will be open to the censure of Parliament. Why do not those honorable senators who arc willing that this policy should be adopted rest satisfied with that position of affairs, knowing that they will have the opportunity of punishing the </para>

If a case should arise in which, legislation that was indorsed by the whole of Australia and was deemed to be necessary, met with a check of this kind we should use every constitutional endeavour to have that check removed. But I am not dealing with that question now. Why should we court a check of that nature and put ourselves in the position of having this useful and necessary legislation hung up, simply for the sake of putting in a provision which would be practically inoperative and would not even carry out the intended object? The case which the Postmaster-General has referred to seems to be a parallel case to this. It is described in this way - </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. I know that South Australia owes a great deal to its German colonists. Still I say I do not desire that our British ships should be manned by Germans or Swedes or Norwegians. I wish to see them manned as largely as possible by British subjects, and if possible by white British subjects. This matter has been dealt with by those in the old country who have had a great deal of experience. The plan they propose in order to meet the difficulty is to insist upon the mercantile marine engaging always a certain number of white apprentices, so that gradually a large force of British white seamen may be built up. A change of the kind contemplated by this amendment could not possibly take place at once without dislocating the whole mercantile marine. I was rather hoping that the honorable senator who introduced it was going to alter the amendment in the direction of providing, not that the coloured -seamen should be discharged right away, but that there should be some sliding scale by which there would be an increasing percentage of white British seamen necessarily engaged on those vessels. </para>

I am with the honorable senator in his anxiety to see white sailors employed, but that cannot be done at once. It must be done gradually, and I am satisfied that this proposal would not bring about the object which the honorable senator has iri view. I should be exceedingly sorry to support an amendment which must, as the Postmaster-General says, drive a considerable portion of our postal matter into the hands of the French and German boat-owners. </para>

That Act has had the opposite effect. It has ruined a large- number of British manufacturers, and driven the trade into the hands of the Germans and French. Our sympathy went out naturally to those who desired to protect the British manufacturer, but yet we made an egregious mistake. If we pass this amendment we shall arrive at exactly the opposite effect to what we want. We shall drive out coloured seamen, and replace them by foreigners. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I confess that I am not quite satisfied with the manner in which the representatives of the Government have combated this motion. They have set up temporary and technical difficulties in order to give strength to what I believe is their sentiment of opposition. And the result Of making their opposition rest upon these temporary and technical points is that they must stand on the same side as the proposer of the amendment as soon as they get explained away the difficulties they have raised. For my part, I intend to take up a straightforward and sentimental view of the question. I may safely say that the true propositions to be considered are those put forward by
                    Largie. The question, really, is one between our views as members of the British Empire, and our views as Australians. As Australians we would all like to have employment in the hands of our own people, and our desire for that has been so great that it has caused every one, I think, in this Chamber to join in the chorus of white Australia as opposed to that of broad imperialism.When I, for one, joined with those who would break in upon the privileges of Imperial subjects in order that we might have a white Australia, I did it with reluctance, and because my immediate regard for Australians overcame my visionary regard for an Imperial Empire. But when it comes to a question of extending it beyond the shores of Australia I confess I can no longer join with those whose greed for Australia has already cut in upon the Imperial Empire. It seems to me to be a monstrous thing to ask English companies to bow down and worship our fetish of a white Australia. As long as you are only dealing with coastal boats I am with you. As long as you are dealing with employment on Australia soil I am with you, but I can certainly see neither fairness or justice to commend a proposal which makes us, because we would like to give employment to our own people tell the British Government -for that is what it means - that they must not allow shipping companies starting from their shores to employ coloured labour. Curiously enough the mover of the motion hits British subjects, and does not hit foreigners. I am broad-minded enough to admit that an Italian, a Spaniard, or a Scandinavian, though he is more akin to us in traditions and in civilization, is no higher in any other respect than a Chinaman or an Indian.

                        <para>- - Yes ; the committee inferred* from that that the Judges gave that decision in order to help out the view of the gentlemen in Parliament to whom the honorable senator was referring, and render it more difficult for the P. and O. Company to employ these lascars. I venture to say that the decision of the Judges had absolutely nothing to do with it, that in so far as it departed from the Merchants Shipping Act it was rather animated by this thought - which, I am glad to say, finds a place in every enlightened mind - that a lascar on board a ship, although he is of a different colour and different habits, and is not up to our methods of civilization, is not therefore to be treated as if he were a serf and a slave. I know that in making these remarks I am expressing sentiments which will greatly jeopardize my chance of coming again into the Senate at the end of three years. </para>

Let us look at this question from a German standpoint. Do the Germans, in subsidizing their lines of steamers, allow of the employment of coloured labour? They would not do so for a moment. </para>
