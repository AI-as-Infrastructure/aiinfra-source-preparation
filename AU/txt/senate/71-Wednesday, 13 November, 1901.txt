An immigration of that kind must. 1 quite understand, in the interests of the colonies, he prevented at all hazards, and we shall not offer any opposition to the proposals intended with that object, but we ask you also to bear in mind the traditions of the Empire, which makes no distinction in favour of or against race or colour, and to exclude by reason of their colour, or by reason of their race, all Her Majesty's Indian subjects, or even all Asiatics, would be an act so offensive to those peoples that it would be most painful, I am quite certain, to Her Majesty to have to sanction it. </para>

                            <para>- As an incident in the historical view of the matter, the fact that the Bill was introduced in the different Parliaments to which I have referred, speaks strongly as to the view taken at the time by the Premiers of the necessity of carrying out this object in such a way as not only to defend the interests of Australia, but also to avoid embarrassment to the Empire, or offence to any Power friendly to the Empire. There is a slight difference between the Acts adopted in Western Australia, New South Wales, Tasmania, and New Zealand, and the Bill which we have introduced, to which it is worth while to call attention. The Western Australia Act provides for the writing out in the presence of an officer, in the characters of any language of Europe, of a passage in English of 50 words in length, taken by such officer from any British author. Honorable senators will see that there was a limitation that the passage must be taken from a British author, and there is no limitation of any kind in that respect in the measure we have introduced here. In the Acts passed in New South Wales, Natal, and Tasmania the test was the writing out of an application in the form of a schedule attached to the Act. </para>

                            <para>- The selection of the language was left apparently to the applicant. In New Zealand also the test was an application in the form of a schedule to the Act. Honorable senators will see the loop-hole which is quite obviously left in any legislation of that land. If we have a set form in a schedule to the Act, and make the only test the writing of an application in that form in some European language, we make it perfectly easy for any person who wishes to prepare for the test to pass it, though he may have absolutely no knowledge whatever of the language used. He may learn, for the purpose of passing the test, just enough of a language to enable him to write out the application set forth in the schedule. That is an objection to many of these Acts to which I call attention, with a view of showing that in the Bill we propose now that loop-hole is closed up, because under this Bill it is absolutely in the discretion of the officer to select any 50 words he likes from any European language. If he has any reason to suppose that the applicant has been getting up any particular form of words, he has an opportunity of testing him there and then in any passage of 50 words that may Gome into his mind. </para>

                            <para>- He may. As I pointed out before, the provision is elastic to such an extent, that nobody but persons of the very highest attainments might be allowed to come in under it, while, on the other hand, it might be exercised in such a way that persons practically having no education at all might be allowed to come in under it. In dealing with a question I surrounded by so many difficulties, the necessity not only of restricting the immigration of these people, but of doing it in such a way as to avoid offence to friendly Powers, and to other portions of the British Empire, is the justification for the form which the Bill takes. It practically puts it into the hands of the Government of the day, through their officer, to exclude just those aliens whom they wish to exclude, with the power of Parliament and of the public opinion of Australia behind them. There is no other way in which we can effectively carry out all the purposes which have to be served by this legislation, and at the same time do our duty to the Empire. The legislation to which I have referred having been passed in three of the federated States, the next question which properly arises is as to how it has worked. Has it been successful ? It is very difficult to give the exact figures, because before the passing of the Acts, no statistics were kept in regard to any of these people but the Chinese. Figures were kept in connexion with the operation of the Chinese Restriction Acts, and in all the States the working of those Acts was exceedingly successful. That is to say, the number that came in was exceedingly small, and the number who went away, very large indeed, with the result that there was a striking diminution in the number of those people in Australia. In regard to all other aliens, as there was no law excluding them, no figures were kept. Since the passing of those Acts, statistics have been kept in almost all the States, and the figures from New South Wales are very striking, as showing the way in which the Act has operated there. In New South Wales the figures are divided into two sets. First of all statistics of immigration into New South Wales from parts beyond the sea, and during two years and nearly eight months, in which these statistics were kept - from somewhere in December, 1898, until July of this year - there were admitted into New South Wales under the Act, 51 male adult coloured aliens, some twelve women and three children. The report from the officer in charge of that branch of administration in New South Wales is that the Act has been absolutely successful, and that the admissions of coloured aliens have been very few. The officer is the Collector of Customs there, and he says - </para>

                            <para>- To Queensland. The significance that is to be deduced from the figures I have quoted is, that where the Act is administered as it has been in New South Wales, the number of coloured aliens who come in is comparatively trifling. It also shows that where no such Act exists it is impossible to restrict or restrain, or even to form any idea of the amount of immigration of coloured people that must go on, and that if in any State this immigration goes on without restriction, the effect is felt through every State. It is useless for any State to attempt to restrict this immigration unless the restriction obtains in every State. The object of this Bill is to make uniform throughout Australia the law which has been successfully in force in three States. The case of Queensland deserves special attention. It has adopted the policy of allowing the influx of Pacific Islanders under certain legislation, and in regard to Japanese, it has adopted, in certain respects, the terms of a treaty between Japan and Great Britain. In regard to other aliens besides Japanese, Queensland has no law dealing with their restriction. There is absolutely nothing in the position of Queensland and Japan to prevent this legislation. Queensland was the only colony which gave its adherence to the treaty negotiated in 1896 and 1897 between Great Britain and Japan. One clause provided that any colony of Great Britain might, if it thought fit, give its adhesion to the treaty on such terms as might be arranged, and Queensland, by a protocol, which was signed between Great Britain and Japan on the 16th March,1897, took advantage of the treaty. But in that protocol there was a special provision that laws, ordinances, and regulations regarding trade, immigration of labourers and artisans, police, and public security, were excepted. It left both Japan on the one hand and Queensland on the other perfectly free to make such laws and ordinances as it thought fit in regard to those matters. </para>

                            <para>- I should think that he would have the same right, but I do not wish to wander away from the point. Is there anything in the relations between Japan and Queensland which would prevent this Parliament from passing this legislation ? I frankly admit that although I feel strongly that this is a measure which ought to be introduced at once, yet I think equally strongly it is the duty of the Commonwealth to regard With the most scrupulous care the honour of any State which had entered into an obligation before federation was effected. If Queensland had entered into any obligation which it would have been in honour bound to observe, then the Commonwealth would be equally in honour bound to observe it. But there is no reason why Queensland should not have passed this legislation, and there is no reason why the Commonwealth should not pass it, and the treaty which exists in regard to other matters expressly permits legislation of this kind. In addition to that, if there is any difficulty in regard to persons other than artisans or labourers there is power to denounce the treaty after twelve months' notice in writing. After twelve months' notice, given by the Commonwealth or by Queensland, whichever might be the proper authority to do so, the treaty would come to an end. That completes a statement of the condition of things in Australia, and it does seem to me that we should deal with this matter, not in a spirit of hostility to any class of aliens, but as a measure of high importance to Australia. We should deal with it from the point of view of Australia, and take care that it is protected, but at the same time not lose sight of the fact that we are a part of the British Empire, and that its interests should be conserved so far as they can be conserved, consistently with justice and right and effective dealing with Australian interests. It is because that can be done - and that has been done under the legislation which exists - we feel that we are on safe ground when we ask that the Commonwealth Parliament shall extend to the whole of Australia the legislation which has operated effectively, so far as Australia is concerned, in the restriction of alien immigration, and which has been satisfactory both to Great Britain and to the friendly power, on whose behalf she made representations to us in 1896 and 1897. The next matter to which I think it right to call the attention of the Senate, is a communication which repeats and emphasises the position of Great Britain, India, and Japan, in regard to a measure which was passed by the Queensland Legislature in 1900, to amend the Sugar Works Guarantee Acts of from 1893 to 1900. One clause of the Bill provided that; - </para>

                        <para>His Majesty's Government fully appreciate the motives which have induced the Government and Legislature of Queensland to piss that particular provision of the Bill now under consideration, but they feel, nevertheless, bound to take objection to that provision on two grounds. In the first place it embodies a disqualification based on place of origin - i. e. , practically a distinction of race and colour. Any attempt to impose disqualifications on the base of such distinctions, besides being offensive to a friendly power, is contrary to the general conceptions of equality which have been the guiding principle of British rule throughout the Empire. Disqualification by educational tests such as are embodied in the immigration laws of various colonies - </para>

                    <para>There, again, we have a statement that the provisions which are already contained in the Acts in force in various States of Australia, and which are the provisions of this Bill, are not objectionable to the British Government, and are not offensive to the friendly power which had been objecting ; that any legislation on these lines, if those tests are not sufficiently stringent, may be adopted ; and that precautions may be still further extended as long as they are extended on those lines. This puts the matter upon the basis upon which I put it previously, that every State has a right to sa,y what shall be the standard of education of those who wish to become members of its community, and has the power to adopt any enactment which follows those lines. </para>

                            <para>- The Japanese consul has taken objection in certain letters, to which I do not intend to refer ; but I may say at once that what we rely upon is the understanding which had evidently been arrived at between Great Britain and the Japanese Government at a time when those other Acts were in force". Those Acts have now been in actual operation for two years without objection either from Japan or Great Britain. AVe think that we are perfectly safe in following legislation which has previously been adopted, and which has been in force during that time. But we cannot give effect to every objection that may be taken by a Japanese consul, or any other official of Japan. We have to do what is reasonable ; and we think we are acting reasonably when we conform to the views of the Japanese Government deliberately expressed at the time these matters were previously under consideration. In view of the fact that these Acts have been in operation without objection, I think we have gone quite as far as is reasonable in the direction of concessions to the feelings of any friendly power. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt the honorable senator refers to the case of British Columbia. I know no more about that case than does any other honorable senator who has read the newspapers, but it appears to me that the significance of what took place depends altogether on the wording of the measure which was reserved for His Majesty's assent. We do not know what that wording was. It may have followed the provisions of the Act of 1896, or it may nob. However, I have not regarded that as a matter of any importance, because it seems to me that there is quite sufficient material before the Senate to enable us to decide the course which any legislation such as is involved in the amendment is likely to lead to. I have put before the Senate at some length - but I hope not at unnecessary length - all these facts and considerations, because it appears to me that we are now about to take an exceedingly important step. We are about to exercise a very important power, and I hope that that power will be exercised with due regard to our obligations from every point of view. We have obligations to Australia which must be discharged. If I thought for one moment that we should not be discharging those obligations by the adoption of this educational test, I should be the last bo ask the Senate to consent to it. But it has been proved by experience, and it is evident on the face of these proposals themselves, that they are and must be effective for keeping out of Australia all those aliens whose entrance into the Commonwealth is likely to be objectionable. In addition to that, if we follow the lines which have been laid down already with the consent of the British Government, and without objection on the part of any friendly power, we shall be carrying out effectively what we wish to accomplish, and at the same time we shall be preventing that embarrassment to the Empire which it is certainly our duty to avoid. Why, if Great Britain were only an ally - a friendly power - if we were absolutely independent, working out our own destiny in our own way, would we disregard the appeal which has been made to us not to embarrass the British Empire ? If Japan were a friendly power, and we were an independent State working out our own destiny in the far East, as Great Britain is doing now, would we refuse to listen to the suggestion that if we can effect our object in a way that is inoffensive to that power, we should do so? In either instance, setting aside the question of the Empire altogether, regarding Japan only as a friendly power, regarding Great Britain - with her millions of Indian subjects whose susceptibilities have to be considered - only as a friendly power, I say at once that it would be a mere reckless and wanton abuse of the powers which we possess to safeguard our own community if we exercised them in such a way as to be needlessly and unnecessarily offensive. How much more then should we regard this request in dealing with Great Britain, which may be placed in a position in which the friendship of Japan will be a matter of the utmost moment to the whole Empire. The issues of conflict in the far East affect us, not only as members of the Empire ; they affect us directly, and will affect us in the future perhaps still more directly. Are we to exercise our powers now as a free people ? We are practically an independent people, because the tie which binds us to the mother country is really a nominal tie. It rests upon affection, common interests, and community of sympathy and race, and if at any moment any of these factors were to disappear, there could be no doubt that Great Britain herself would be just as glad to let us go our own way as we should be to pursue that way. She would place no obstacle in the path. But, standing in the relation which we occupy to Great Britain, it is our duty now to exercise our powers in a way that will give to Australia what she wants, but which will not, at the same time, needlessly offend any power friendly to Australia, nor embarrass the Empire of which we form a part, and of whose history and career we are all so proud. </para>

                        I have the honour to address you on the subject of alien restriction, especially in view of proposals for legislation intended to be brought before the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. The. friendship that exists between the Empires of Great Britain and Japan leads me to suppose that your Government would not willingly take steps calculated to wound the feelings of the people whom it is my privilege to represent.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Japanese belong to an Empire whose standard of civilization is so much higher than that of kanakas, negroes, Pacific Islanders, Indians, or other Eastern peoples, that to refer to them in the same terms cannot but be regarded in the light of a reproach, which is hardly warranted by the fact of the shade of the national complexion. </para>
                    <para>My Government recognises distinctly the right of the Government of Australia to limit in any way it thinks fit the number of those persons who may be allowed to land and settle in Australia, and also to draw distinction between persons who may or may not be admitted. Corresponding rights belong to the Empire of Japan. </para>
                    <para>Might I suggest, therefore, that your Government formulate some proposal which, being accepted by my Government, would allow of the people of Japan being excluded from the operation of any Act which directly or indirectly imposed a tax on immigrants on the ground of colour ? </para>
                    <para>I have the honour also to remind you that the import and export trade between Japan and the Australian Commonwealth has already assumed important dimensions and is rapidly growing, as a. reference to statistics will prove. And the Japanese Government has subsidized the line of steamers which run between Japan, Hong Kong, Manilla, and the Australian ports. </para>
                    <para>I append to this letter extracts from letters written to the Government of New South Wales, which may make the position as regards the Japanese clearer. </para>
                    <para>Permit me to say that, so far as Japan is concerned, New South Wales has no reason to fear alien immigration. The Japanese Government does not wish to lose any of its subjects, and, so far as the people themselves are concerned, they are under no necessity to emigrate, as may be judged from the fact that wages have nearly doubled within the last three years, consequent upon the marked development that has taken place in many industrial pursuits. </para>
                    <para>My Government, I am sure, will be quite ready at any moment to give any assurance, or to enter into any suitable arrangements for controlling immigration to New South Wales, and they do not wish it to be believed for a moment that they have any thought or wish to promote Japanese immigration to your shores or elsewhere. </para>
                    <para>Although I am without instructions on the point I do not hesitate to say that the Government of Japan will be quite prepared at any time to make an arrangement by treaty or otherwise that will practically secure for New South Wales, so far as Japan is concerned, all that the proposed legislation can secure. I may draw your attention to the fact that Japan has shown in several ways a desire to promote the most friendly relations with Australia. That you may judge how far New South Wales is benefiting already, and is likely to benefit in the future, I put before you the following particulars : - 1. Japan has wholly removed the duty on wool. 2. A subsidy of Â£70,000a year it being paid to secure regular steamer communication with </para>

                            I have the honour to address you again on the subject of the Immigration Restriction Bill now before the House of Representatives. I should like you to understand dearly that my object in writing now is to try to remove some of the difficulties which a misunderstanding as to the attitude of the Japanese nation may have created. An impression appears to exist in some quarters and to find voice in certain sections of the Australian press, that Australia is in danger of an influx of Japanese immigrants. I have already endeavoured to show that this impression is altogether erroneous, and in support of this position I have been requested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tokyo to bring under your notice some clauses of the Japanese Act passed in 1890, and amended this year, 1901, for the regulation and control of emigration and the protection of Japanese emigrants. Under this Act it is provided that no Japanese may go abroad without first applying to the Government in writing for permission to do so, and his application must be accompanied by a guarantee, signed by two or more responsible sureties for the good conduct of the emigrant while abroad. On the receipt of such an application, the Government may grant a pass-port, provided that it is satisfied as to the character of the applicant, the position of the sureties, and also that there is no danger of the emigrant's presence being in any way offensive to the people of the county whither lie intends to go.

                            I trust you will pardon me for addressing you so soon again on the subject of the Immigration Restriction Bill now under consideration by the Federal Parliament. But I am sure you will admit that the importance of the issues involved, not only to the Australian Commonwealth, but also to Great Britain and Japan is great enough to constitute a sufficient reason for my action. Since I wrote to yon hist I have received a copy of the proposed amendments upon the original draft Bill, and in that portion of the debate which took place on the 12th inst., as reported in the Sydney press of the 1 3th, some observations were made by several speakers referring so directly to the Japanese as to compel me to take official notice of them.

                        <para>In Japanese schools and other educational establishments the most approved European methods are adopted, and the most important works on science, literature, art, politics, law, &amp;c., which are published in Europe from time to time, are translated into Japanese for the use of students. Thus a Japanese, without being acquainted with any other language than his own, is frequently up to a very high educational standard in the most advanced branches of stud3' by means of a liberal use of these translations. I cannot imagine an}' sufficient reason why the Japanese language should not be regarded as upon the same footing with, say, the Turkish, the Russian, the Greek, the Polish, the Norwegian, the Austrian, or the Portuguese, or why, if an immigrant of any of the nationalities I have mentioned may be examined in his own language, the same courtesy should not be extended to a Japanese. But if, in spite of all the representations that have been made upon this subject, and the alternative suggested, it should become clear that the Australian Commonwealth Parliament has decided to frame an important Act, specially directing its operation against a friendly nation and without sufficient justification for so doing by any existing circumstances, it will become a necessity for my Government to make the strongest possible protest in the proper quarter. </para>

My communications, however, were not fortunate enough to produce the desired effect ; inasmuch as the educational test decided upon is racial, pure and simple. In addition to this, the subsequent insertion of the word "European" in an amendment on the clause which provides for the imposition of penalties On masters and owners of ships emphasizes the intention of the Bill to make racial distinctions. And there has since been passed through both Houses a new clause in the Post and Telegraph Bill stipulating for "white labour only" in all Government mail contracts and agreements. </para>

As you are well aware, during the whole of the past century we have been members of the nation, and under British rule. We are proud to be under the wise and merciful rule of the British Government, because we know that there is no other in the world which is so good ; but we cannot understand how it is that our own Government now wish to separate us from herself, and to put us as strangers along with the outside nations of the world ; especially it is very painful for us to be put along with the Chinese, who are a defeated and dying race. Nobody knew before this what were the relations existing between the British Government and ourselves, but considered that all people under British rule (especially those who do the bulk of the fighting of the Empire) formed part of the British nation. But now it is shown to all the nations of the world that we are separated by the will of the British Government, as shown in the action of the Commonwealth Government in separating us from the nation and putting us amongst the outside peoples of the world in the Alien Immigration Bill. </para>

                        Hart returns this month to his task of endeavouring to place his unrivalled knowledge of China at the service of the Western student and statesman. It will surprise some of his readers to be told that it is a mistake to suppose that Stagnation is the rule in China. The Censorate, he says, is continually calling attention to lapses from what is right in administrative practice and official conduct. But the governing mind is divided between the conservative and the progressive schools of thought.
                        Against her will, he says,
                        She will emerge healthy, strong, and experienced, he predicts, and she will have forced upon her the best military strength, the bast arms, the most suitable drill, the highest education, and soldiers in such numbers as population permits and circumstances require. Regarding the literature of China he has much to say. The educated Chinaman, he says, is a mine of intellectual wealth. Foreigners who study the language become enamoured of it, and wish for several times man's three score and ten years to revel in the millions of books, and read what they have to say on every conceivable subject.
                        relates how as long ago as 1858 a Chinese friend told him how a book 2,000 years old described something like the phonograph being in use 1,000 years before. His information deals with the habit of thought of the Chinese, the influence of the Confucian cult, the processes of government, the extra-territorial attitude of foreigners, and other matters respecting which his long residence in China eminently qualifies him to speak.

                        <para>A leading firm in Japan has written to a merchant in Wellington (N.Z.) (writes a Dunedin correspondent), expressing a desire to obtain regular supplies of wool, hides, flax, certain kinds of timber, and other New Zealand products. The firm isa manufacturing one, doing business on a large scale, and some of its goods are sent to New Zealand. It was proposed to send two or three representatives to the colony to arrange for shipments, and the principals asked if any restrictions would be placed on these representatives. This latter question has been referred to the Premier, who has replied that each Japanese agent would be required to pay Â£100 as poll tax, but this sum would be refunded when each completed his business and sailed on his return journey. </para>

                            <para>- Or under any restrictions other than those which shall be totally effective. I desire to say that the objection we have to these aliens coming here is not purely industrial. I know that the protest coming from the labour party is regarded merely as a protest due to their looking upon this only as an industrial question - that they object to the Asiatic because he works for less wages as. a rule than the European. That is a minor objection ; it is not the chief objection. The chief objection is entirely racial, and it is also the most powerful objection. If we were to object to them simply on industrial grounds we should on the same grounds have to object to the introduction of machinery. It has a tendency to displace labour. It has also a tendency, to a certain extent, to cheapen labour, and if we objected to Asiatics because they displaced or cheapened white labour, to be logical, we should have to object to machinery on the same ground. We do not object simply upon those grounds. I say that is one of the effects of their being here, but we object to them also because their standard of civilization from every standpoint is different to ours, and because the effect of their intermingling with other nations is fatal to the national character. A great deal is said at the present time as to the superiority of the Japanese over the other Asiatic races. On this subject I should like to quote an opinion coming from the Dominion of Canada, where, as we know from their press, they have had to face this question, and where they have passed legislation in the Province of British Columbia respecting Chinese and Japanese particularly. The Chief Justice of the Dominion of Canada, who cannot be said to be prejudiced upon the question, says that - </para>

                            <para>- Under the two Acts, but I think I shall be able to show that of the numbers given it was not possible for more than 100 to have been introduced under the Imported Labourers Registry Act. During the time mentioned, there were 496 Asiatics imported into Western Australia, and during the whole year to the28th August, 1901, there were only 109 agreements entered into by Asiatics coming in under the Imported Labourers Registry Act. These people must enter into agreements, and the number of agreements given may include agreements with persons entering during the year, or renewals of agreements with persons from previous years, so that the 109 might be cut down to at least 100. That number taken from the 496 would leave 396 Asiatics who came in under the Immigration Restriction Act despite the educational test. </para>

                            <para>- The argument used by the Government in another place, and which I am endeavouring to refute, was that these 496 did not come in under the Immigration Restriction Act, but under the Imported Labourers Registry Act, but the returns which, upon my motion have been laid upon the table of the Senate, clearly show that not more than 109 at the outside came in under the Imported Labourers Registry Act. I can say from my own experience that of the 396 to which I have referred, those who came in under exemption as persons who were returning to the State must have been very few, and by far the greater number of the 396 must have come in under the Immigration Restriction Act, and whether they came in after passing the test or through laxity of administration, of course, I am unable to say. </para>

                        <para>The English language is making great progress, and is also being taught in the schools. English is being taught everywhere. English is the language of commerce and of the Government offices. English has been made obligator}' in the common schools of the country. </para>
                        <para>If education is compulsory, and English is taught in the common schools, what must follow? Within a few years the Japanese will be as conversant with the English language as are the English themselves. If we are met with the assurance that they may bo tested in some European language, is it not reasonable to believe that a great proportion of them will be familiar with other languages of Europe ? And is it not also reasonable to assume that we have not many Customs officials who are acquainted with other languages of Europe ? I can conceive that it will be very easy for the Japanese or any other Asiatics to imitate a European language sufficiently well to ]3ass the bulk of our Custom-house officers. I do not think that the Custom-house officer will be a very competent judge of efficiency in a European language unless it happens to be the English language. While the Bill provides that European languages may be applied, the result will be that recourse will be had to only the English language. When similar strides in English education are being made in China, and a great proportion of the Indians can read and write the English language, where is the effectiveness of the proposed test? </para>

                        <para>In1858 Japan was an obscure country, almost unknown to the rest of the world, and her Government a (now obsolete) feudal system. The foot of man or horse supplied the place of moil train, telegraph and telephone ; the back of beast or the shoulder of man was her only means of land transport; her people went about the streets armed with swords, and no sign of western civilization could be detected in her social or political life........ Thirty-two years have passed away, and in the interval our country has seen a great and glorious revolution, followed by a period of social and national progress which is unprecedented in the annals of the world. </para>

                            <para>- If the amendment said that the Asiatics were a low, sordid and unworthy people it would give offence ; but does it necessarily say so ? does it even presumptively say so ? I think not. We must remember after all that life itself is a race, and when competitors in a race object to a newcomer is it because they think him a laggard or inefficient ? Is it not because they fear his superior skill? Is there, therefore, anything derogatory in our saying to the Japanese or other nations, "We shall not allow you to compete with us. We do not mind Europeans, because they are all of the same stock, with kindred instincts and manners. Their habits of thought are alike, and their conditions of life are no lower; their endurance is no greater ; their agility or skill is no better than our own ; but we will not have you. You have the advantage of an older civilization ; you have acquired habits of industry and frugality. You are very adaptable in your methods." </para>

                            <para>- I believe that vanity and egotism are quite as strong in the east as in the west. If we were to put the plain, unvarnished truth into the Bill, it would be regarded by the Japanese in the way I have suggested, and they would say - "These English are a narrow, conservative, uncouth race, not half as noble or as high as we are, but so long as we are put in the category of exclusion on the ground of our great industry and frugality, and our conditions of life being lower, we see no insult, and we leave those wretched English to their wretched colonies." I am perfectly certain that that would be less offensive to them than a Bill which tells them in plain terms - " Stop out because you cannot pass a test," when, in fact, they know that that is a mere thin veneer, covering an insult we have not the manliness to state. </para>

I might say that logically, but I do not say it. Before committing myself, I wish to make some reservations, not with the view of qualifying the vote I shall give, or of minimizing the views I shall express, but for the purpose of preserving the consistency of my conduct, having regard to a previous utterance made by me, and preventing misconception in the future. I do not intend by my vote to pledge myself to support the present Pacific Islands Labourers Bill. I might be compelled, in consistency, to vote for ultimate exclusion, but for the preservation of a great industry, a degree of gradual exclusion has been provided by the Government, and I wish to keep myself open to object both to the degree of exclusion and to the manner of exclusion provided for in that Bill. The second reservation I wish to make is that in my opinion a white Australia does not mean white passenger ships or white mails. </para>

                            <para>- I would try and make Australia white, while the Government would allow Australia to be as speckled as cultured black men could make it, and yet make the ships bringing them here perfectly white. That is a curious absurdity. Every tendency of my mind and disposition is against this and all similar exclusions. For a long time it did seem to me to be ungenerous, bigoted, narrow for us to arrogate to ourselves a superiority over all the Asiatic peoples, who knew a high state of civilization while our ancestors were in a state of barbarism that brought down the contempt of the legions of the Roman Empire less than 1,800 years ago. And my view in this respect has been somewhat accentuated by my recollection that we are never tired of boasting of our being participants in the British Empire - an Empire which owes a great portion of its wealth, and most of its strength, to the variety and vast number of its communities, most of which are to be found in Asia. But, notwithstanding that, when I come to consider how I should cast my vote and discharge the duty, which, as a representative, I owe to Australian feeling, I am satisfied that I ought strenuously to oppose any further admission of Asiatics or Africans to our shores. Many a good cause has been lost by bad arguments, and for some time I found myself in the opposite camp by reason of the grounds on which a white Australia was advocated. We were told that these people were ignorant, sordid, immoral, that to touch them would contaminate the noble Briton. I have no sympathy with those arguments. I am not prepared to admit, and certainly I am not disposed to base any arguments on the admission, that the Asiatic peoples are inferior to us in any respect, morally, intellectually, or physically. But admitting their equality, even their superiority, I still say that we should keep them out. The question is after all, not one of degree, but one of kind. They are totally different from us, root, branch, and fibre. We possess a certain language, stature, and complexion, certain manners and habits of thought and action. These have comedown to us as the heritage of many generations. They are endeared to us actually and traditionally, and whether better or worse, we as patriots should think them the best in the world. How can we hope to retain the type of humanity they represent if we allow an admixture of people who, in all these respects, are fundamentally different, and the admixture I refer to is a free and unrestrained association, such as would carry with it the' right to intermarriage, and to participate equally and fully with us in our social habits and our political institutions. The strongest advocate of the view I am now putting forward could not, with the slightest hope of being listened to by any man with a grain of common sense, assert for ono moment that Australians would ever permit these alien races to form one of them as people of their own race do. If we could not have a free and unrestrained association - how could we? - our prejudices and sentiments would not allow it, and prejudices and sentiments are facts in politics - we had better have no association at all. Do we not see in America, where the coloured people are nominally of the same standing with people of our own race, that they really never have assimilated, and that the two races are now like oil and water in one vessel ? </para>

                            <para>- I thought that in the minds of some honorable senators the bonds were attenuated down to the degree that would be covered by that very elastic expression - "incompatibility of temper." I may be wrong. Is there anything unfair, however, in our legislation saying that? </para>

                            <para>- Is there anything in it derogatory to the Indian subjects of the Empire ? Does not every man know that there are partners in business who during the occupations of the day are most thoroughly loyal and mutually helpful, and yet are unable to sit over the same fireside without squabbling ? Surely for such persons it is better in the interests of their businesses and themselves that they should not share the same hearth. I take up the same position with regard to our Indian fellow subjects. "We want to have them as partners in international affairs. Let us fight - let us legislate - let us trade to our mutual advantage. But let us make them strangers to our domestic concerns. And, after all, why should the British Empire be dragged in to justify our not having a white Australia ? What is the British Empire ? It is only a grand confederation. And is not a confederation such that each of the parts retains for itself its own social and political entity ? Why, then, should the Empire be dragged in to make the colours run into one another? The Empire is naturally piebald - why not keep it so ? Why blend the colours ? </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that the nations of the earth generally are too much occupied in the effort to find new markets for their commerce, instead of attempting to make themselves happy in the territory which they possess. The great mistake which some of the nations appear to be making is in thinking that they can go to a country like China and successfully carry on trade there, to their own profit, for any length of time. It will not be very long before China will have her own manufactures. She is building them up at the present time, and it will not be many years hence when by means of her hordes of cheap labour she will be able to compete successfully with England. </para>

I am sure the honorable senator must give me credit for being able to see through the political tricks of some honorable senators, just as they see through the political tricks perhaps of honorable senators in the labour corner. To come back to the attitude of the Japanese towards Europeans it is not so very long since the cry of "Death to the Barbarians " was a very pronounced cry in Japan, and I doubt very much whether it is entirely suppressed yet. Honorable senators know that when the Japanese cry " Death to the Barbarians," they mean death to Europeans, British, and Australians who may be in the treaty ports. Of course, that cry has ceased to a very large extent, and if there is anything taking its place it is a system of boycott which is carried on in Japan against the British and </para>

Very clever workwomen, who, by the sheer delicacy of their touch, are able to tell to a match without the trouble of counting them how many go to a box, are paid 7d. per day. Some objection has been made to the employment of so many infants, but the mothers do not seem to object, for in the first place the children add a farthing or so to the general fund, and in the second they are able to keep them about them, which no doubt saves them much anxiety. </para>

                        <para>To the external world, one-half of Asia appears to have become European. In reality, however, neither Russia nor Great Britain has as yet exercised any "influence" upon the millions she has conquered. In the north, the tribes are only held down by Russia, would rebel in a moment if they dared, and show no sign of accepting either her civilization, her ideas, or her creed. In the south, Great Britain has enforced a peace which has produced manifold blessings, but she has neither won nor converted any large section of her subject populations. There is no province, no tribe, no native organization in India upon which, in. the event of disaster, she could rely for aid. After nearly a century of clement Government, there are not 10,000 natives in India, who, unpaid and uncoerced, would die in defence of British sovereignty. The moment it became known in 1857 that, owing to the shrinkage of the white garrison, the enterprise was possible, the most favoured class in the peninsula, the Sepoys, sprang at their rulers' throats, and massacred all they could reach, without either mercy or regret. The war lasted three years. . . . The British remain masters, but beneath the small film of white men who makeup the Indian Empire, boils or sleeps away a sea of dark men, incurably hostile, who await with patience the day when the ice shall break, and the ocean regain its power of restless movement under its own laws. </para>

                        <para>The Asiatic, believing as he invariably does, that his social system is divine, is content with it, clings to it, and resents interference with it with a passion that leads to bloodshed wherever bloodshed is possible. He is aware, keenly aware, that white government sooner or later involves revolution in his social system, and he hates it with an undying hatred, such as an Irish peasant feels for the "agent" who may some day evict him, and who meanwhile levies rent. . . And it must be remembered that the European shares this feeling of separateness completely. Whatever the cause - whether, as he himself thinks, antagonism of colour, or, as I think, difference in permanent ideals - the effect is the same ; the European cannot merge himself in the Asiatic without a sense of degradation, which is almost invariably followed by its reality. . . . They (the Asiatics) know that their only chance of victory is. to kill the whole white people out. The obnoxious race will never make terms, never merge in the population, never be anything but rulers, and therefore if their rule is to terminate, they must be exterminated. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will be able to gauge the quality of the sympathy which the Imperial authorities have had for the Indian subject when they are willing to bind him down so that he shall not receive a wage f more than about 5s. per week. </para>
                    <para>Further, no Indian may go abroad in the streets of Natal without a badge showing whose servant he is. If found without a badge he is lodged in gaol. No Hindoo or native African may exercise the vote, engage in trade of any kind unless he can prove his ability to keep suitable books in the English language. No coloured person can hold prospecting licences, diggers' claims, mining leases, or other mining holdings No Indian may walk the streets after dark, and may only use the middle of the road - side- walks not being for him. An Indian who is not in service must pay Â£3 a year for a badge. He shall not be entitled to a licence to carry on any trade or calling, nor shall he be entitled to acquire land in leasehold, freehold, or otherwise, or to exercise the franchise, or to be enrolled as a burgess of any borough, or on the roll of any township ; aud any licence of franchise which may have been acquired in contravention of this Act Shall be void. </para>

                        <para>The Government of Natal has been forced b}' public opinion to protest against the claim of the Indian Government that Indians, being British subjects, are entitled to live in any part of the Empire on the same conditions* as white British subjects. Following in the wake of the indentured coolies, a superior class of Asiatics settled in the colony, and started trade operations. The effect of this Indian immigration to Natal has been to ruin many of the small English traders, and the better class Asiatics have now obtained a monopoly of most of the East African trade. The Imperial Government will no doubt insist upon Indian subjects having equal rights with white men, but the future federal States of South Africa will, I believe, defy the Home Government as did New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- It is a very strange thing that the Imperial authorities should have objected to the insertion of that section. My own impression is - and I am sure that other Queenslanders agree with me - that the Imperial authorities objected to that section, not because it was contrary to the traditions of British Government, but because interested parties in Queensland were able to get the ear of the Governor and of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. At the time that the Sugar Works Guarantee Act was passed, several other Acts were passed dealing with the construction of railways, and containing the very same section. Yet those Acts were allowed. </para>

The Sovereign has to rely upon the Governors and certain other officers ; and if certain parties in a State have political influence enough they can get the ear of the Governor and of the Secretary of the State, and can bring about a veto upon any legislation we pass. Pour private railway Bills contain the following section : - </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the private railway Bills were reserved for the Royal assent, but the Governor, who gave his assent to these Bills in the name of Her late Majesty, knew of the Sections contained in them. It would, of course, be through the Governor that the request would be made to the Imperial authorities to disallow the Sugar Works Guarantee Act, because it contained a prohibition of Asiatic labour. I feel very strongly about the interference of the Imperial authorities with any legislation that is passed in our legislative halls. When we speak of the approval or disapproval of His Majesty the King, we know very well that, in all probability, the King has not sufficient time to consider the proposed legislation. He is too much engaged in endeavouring to learn what his duties are, and in attending social functions, to bother very much about this part of the world. He has to accept the advice of his Cabinet, and I venture to say that his present Cabinet in no way represents the majority of the people of England. It is a Cabinet supported by a Parliament elected upon a property qualification. There is no "one-man-one-vote" about the Parliamentary elections in England, Property and money exercise a very great influence in the election of members of the House of Commons. Many millions of our fellow subjects in the old country have not the right to a vote. </para>

It is mainly because the influx of Chinese, or of persons of any other inferior nationality is a disturbing cause to social peace and contentment that it should not be tolerated. No advantage to employers, no convenience to a limited number of citizen's can compensate for loosening the consanguineous ties which bind a State together. If we may speak of statesmanship, there is yet another and a higher ground of objection. In founding a free State no nationality or class should be considered whom we are not prepared to admit to all our franchises, to all our rights of property, all our privileges of citizenship, all our social usuages and trusts, not excluding intermarriage. The existence of a servile or degraded class is incompatible with the safe possession of national liberty. </para>

Why, a Government that stood in fear for the technical observance of the law in any such case as that would be swept away, and deservedly swept away. ...

                            <para>- There is no doubt in my mind, but I am anxious that honorable senators shall not have any erroneous impressions regarding my attitude towards the great people of the old country. I am satisfied that if ever a majority of the people of the old country get the same chance of expressing their opinions as the people of this country have had, through the ballotbox, there will be very a different attitude taken up by the Imperial authorities with respect to legislation of this kind. I am sure there is nothing that the people of Australia could desire which would not be granted by an Imperial Cabinet selected by men elected to the House of Commons on a basis of one adult one vote. Having placed my position clearly before honorable senators, I hope the Government will see their way to make this Bill of an effective character. If the Government insist and can succeed in putting this Bill through in its present form, and, if as I believe, the restrictions will prove ineffective, it will then be their duty to take the whole of the responsibility. They know very well that they have a mandate from the people of Australia to bring in and pass a total exclusion Bill, and if having had an opportunity to pass legislation of this kind they fail to avail themselves of it, I think they will have forfeited the confidence of the people of Australia, and should be turned out of office. </para>

                        (Tasmania).I should just like to say that I am a little surprised at the position taken up by the Government. It is within our knowledge that in another place they are introducing a measure to add 350,000 black men to our Commonwealth. I do not know how that legislation is going to work in with this Bill.

                        <para>- It will be a territory attached to our Commonwealth. It will be under our Government, and not under the disabilities this Bill will impose. It seems to me that in the first Parliament of our young nation a Bill of this character ought to be justified by necessity. When it is necessary we certainly ought to consider it, but I have looked in vain to the reasons submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council for any proof of urgent necessity. The honorable and learned senator gave none. Some honorable senators consider that they have a mandate from the people to press this matter upon the Government, and there is no doubt that they are doing so. A doctrine of one of the sections anxious for this Bill, the representatives of labour, used to be the equality of man. Where is that doctrine in this Bill? </para>
