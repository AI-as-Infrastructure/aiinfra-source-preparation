                        <para>- I have an objection to the amendment. In the Customs Bill Ave. have defined the word "officer " in a very wide way. Almost anybody employed is an officer. The reason of that is that it is essential in the operations of the Customs to have the persons who are employed endowed with authority to net at the moment. But it is not so with regard to a Bill of this kind. There are special, duties to be performed and special officers employed to perform them. We have deliberately made a difference in the definition of the word "officer " under this Bill as compared with the Customs Bill. The "officer of Customs" must be a person who is actually an officer of Customs and an officer of the public service. The honorable senator's amendment lias been considered, and there is no doubt on the subject. </para>

                    <para>- It was intended, when this Bill and the Beer Excise Bill were introduced, to incorporate with them certain provisions of the Customs Bill relating to the machinery for the prosecution of offences, the performance of duties by officers, and matters of that kind. As a general Excise Bill is to be introduced, it has been considered much better to have these provisions in that measure, and to have the whole group of Excise Bills read together. This Bill and the Beet Excise Bill will therefore be read as incorporated with the Excise Bill and those provisions relating to the prosecutions and the duties of officers will be embodied in the Excise Bill. For that reason I move - </para>

The Government themselves or the Senate may decide to make alterations in the Excise Bill. We are asked to legislate entirely in the dark, and it would be very much better to keep this clause back. </para>

                        <para>- It is not at all likely that the difficulty that the honorable and learned senator suggests will arise, because the reference here is to parts of the Excise Bill, and not to clauses of it. As to whether it is better to carry this clause now in the amended form suggested on the understanding that I undertake to recommit it, the necessity of recommitting the clause is exceedingly remote. The clauses of the Excise Bill will be under discussion by the Senate, and honorable senators will then have this Bill in view as well, and will know that in whatever form the parts of the Excise Bill are passed they will be incorporated in this Bill. If it is subsequently considered necessary to recommit the Bill, that can be done, but I think it is exceedingly unlikely. </para>

The Government may resign to-day or to-morrow, and may never be able to go on with the Excise Bill. How foolish we should then look if we should have framed a clause in which there i was a reference to a Bill which had never | seen daylight in this Chamber. In view of the extraordinary character of the proposal. I would like to ask the Chairman whether it is in order for the Vice-President to introduce any reference to a Bill which is not only not before the Chamber, but which has not yet arrived in this Chamber ? </para>

I submit that it is perfectly in order for the committee to do what we propose, on the ground that it violates no rule, while it is also very convenient.

                    <para>- My attention has been called to the fact that no provision is made in clause 10 for the use of stills other than for the purpose of distilling spirits. A gentleman largely connected with the distillation of eucalyptus oil has waited on the Commissioner of Customs, and has also seen the Vice-President of the Executive Council. I do not know what action is proposed to be taken, but I am informed that there are 135 licences for the distillation of eucalyptus oil in Victoria, and that there are about 500 people employed in the industry here. There are similar distil lat ions in South Australia and Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that is within the field of State legislation. We have to be very careful not to entrench in any way upon what are really the rights of the States in regard to their own health laws. The Government propose to apply the provisions of this Bill entirely to the distillation of spirits which are dutiable. I think the only provision referring to stills is that contained in clause 10, which practically gives the Government the power of inspecting, controlling, and licensing them. On considering the matter, especially after I had had an opportunity of a personal conference with some gentlemen interested in this matter, I thought that it would be very much better to deal in some way with stills for purposes other than the distillation of spirits, with' the result that the Government now propose to insert this new clause. We intend to have a provision which will compel every one who is going to use a still for manufacturing purposes to communicate that fact to the Customs officers so that they may know that a still is going to be erected. The party who is going to erect it will have to enter into a guarantee that he will not use it for the purpose of distilling spirits, and the Customs officers will have a right to inspect the still and see that it is not used in such a way as to be likely to defraud the revenue. Having satisfied themselves on that point, they have nothing more to say ; they cannot do anything more. It is necessary that the Customs officers should know | where these stills are situate, and have an ' opportunity of inspecting them, but beyond . that they have no right to interfere, and do i not wish to interfere with them. That I amount of interference is necessary to prevent the revenue from being defrauded. The matter is not "without some kind of precedent, because in one of the American Acts there is a clause which deals very much in the way we propose with distillation for manufacturing purposes. It is dealt with by registration under an Act passed in America in July, 1S6S, for imposing taxes on distilled spirits, tobacco, and for other purposes. It is a general Distillation Act. Under these circumstances, I think the honorable senator will see that we have to keep in touch with the buying and erection of stills in a way that will enable the Customs officers to see that the Federal Government is not defrauded. At the same time we shall not interfere with them in any way more than is absolutely necessary for that purpose. </para>

                    <para>- The clause provides that under a distiller's licence no one can sell less than two gallons. Not only in South Australia, but in other States people come for spirits to the places where distillation is carried on. In South Australia they have been in the habit of getting one gallon and taking it away for a long distance into the country, and using it for any purpose, even for medicinal purposes. That supply would last them a long time. Even in country public houses a gallon of a certain kind of spirit might last as long as one would care to invest his capital. A great deal of one spirit might be consumed and another spirit might be used in very limited quantities. I do not see that there is any virtue in fixing the quantity at two gallons. If it is fixed at two gallons, then in places where distillation is carried on the probability is that a dummy will be eni1 ployed. A man will get a storekeeper's licence from the Government and act as a dummy to the distiller. I do not think we want to encourage anything of that kind ; therefore, to make the Bill serve the convenience of the public as much as possible, I move. - </para>

                    <para>- The amendment affects a very important principle of the Bill, and I do not see my way to consent to it. In all the States except South Australia, the limit is two gallons. Unless a person is licensed in the ordinary way to sell spirits, the wholesale dealers cannot sell less than two gallons. If we allow what are practically small quantities of spirits to be sold, we render the illicit sale of spirits very much easier. It has been recognised in all our State legislation that we should take care not to render the sale of spirits in these small quantities, except by persons licensed to sell them, more easy than is necessary, and with regard to persons not licensed in the ordinary way to sell by retail, not to allow them to sell in smaller quantities than two gallons. This is one of those matters in which uniformity has to be brought about, and the question is whether it should be secured by reducing the quantity in all the States to that which is allowed in South Australia, or by bringing that State into line with the others. We have to decide that on the question of what, altogether apart from every other consideration, is really in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Independently of the fact that in the majority of the States the limit is fixed at two gallons, it is really right and necessary, for the prevention of the kind of illicit sale of spirits that goes on, unless there is some stringent regulation of this sort, to adhere to the two gallons limit. The clause does not affect the question of selling more or less than two gallons. No person, for instance, who is a publican, and no person who, for any reason, would be entitled to sell less quantities of spirits than two gallons, could be licensed under the Bill. I think honorable senators will see that it is very undesirable to give a licence to distil to a person who is really selling by retail, and the limit of a gallon comes very near to what one might call retail trade. </para>

                        <para>- It applies equally to spirits. Anyhow it is so near the line of retail trade that it is thought desirable not to put temptation in the way of a person who may be licensed under the Act as a distiller to carry on that business, in con-1 junction with the retail business. </para>

                    <para>- There is not very much in the contention of the Minister, because a distiller could easily put up a dummy to retail his spirits in quantities of one gallon. Instead" of having to deal with one firm of a very high repute, we should then have to deal with another person under another licence. It is not as if the licensee were dealing in an article of very great consumption, like beer. The article has not a very great consumption in that sense, and therefore I think, if we make this amendment, we shall be safeguarding our licence in a very much better way than is done in the clause. If the distiller is desirous of selling one gallon at a time, and thus getting a very much larger number of customers than he could possibly get under the Bill, he will undoubtedly put up an agent to take out a. licence, and will supply him with spirits. Instead of leaving it open to him to take that roundabout way, it would be very much better to permit him to sell one gallon at a time. </para>

                    <para>- The difference between the Bills in question is that in the case of a brewery it is not found necessary to have an officer living on the premises. It is only occasionally that he is required there. But it is absolutely necessary in the case of a distillery. In the operation of a brewery there are certain times when the officer must be present, but he need not be there always. In regard to a distillery, however, the officer must always be present.. There must be accommodation provided for him at all times, and it is very much better to have the duty imposed by law upon the distiller. </para>

                        <para>- They may seriously affect the 'duty. For instance, under a vigneron's licence a great deal of: material may be worked up, and opportunities would be given for defrauding the excise by enabling distillation to take place over a, great area which would, be practically free from the control of the officer. There is, I admit, another element attaching to (a) and (6). But the point I wish to take is that the Government cannot very well say that they cannot trust the officer, when the discretion given to the officer under the Customs Bill and anal ago us measures are enormous. It cannot surely be said to be a reason, that in interfering with the process of distillation or any other of these processes in respect of which duties are charged, the Customs officers would be liable to be " got at." The difficulty is this - under paragraph (a) we prohibit the introduction of any substance which increases the specific gravity or prevents the true strength of the liquor from being ascertained. The distillers do not wish to interfere with that in any way whatever. That is absolutely essential, because if deceit be practised with regard to the strength of spirit, duties will be constantly evaded. But distillers tell me that it may also have the effect of preventing redistillation of. spirits which ought to be redistilled, and which can only be properly put through that operation by the addition of salts of potash, which undoubtedly changes the specific gravity of.liquor. If we put in the words "except by authority" we shall enable the officer to say that the addition of this substance may be permitted where he is satisfied that it is not being done for the purpose of. preventing the true strength being ascertained, but for the purpose of redistillation. The distillers of South Australia say that such an amendment is necessary because there is no other, provision which will enable redistillation to be carried out. I do not suggest any alteration of the provision prohibiting anything being done which would lead to the destruction of the revenue, but a discretion should be left to the authorities in this matter. If it is said that an ordinary officer should not have this discretion I shall.be content to leave it with some superior., officer or with the collector. It is necessary that there should be some discretion allowed, and that the rule under the Bill should not be one of hard-and-fast prohibition. If the clause is carried in its present form, its effect will be to prevent the redistillation of these spirits. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to say in answer to the honorable and learned senator, that the gentlemen who have supplied him with information, have failed to notice that it is only while the spirits are in the receiver or charger that nothing must be done which will affect the specific gravity. The reason for that is that it is then that the specific gravity is ascertained and the calculations made upon which duty is to be paid. It is pointed out to me that before they are put in there or afterwards, these additions may be made by authority, and the expressed prohibition is only while the spirits are in the receiver or charger. As a matter of fact, there will be no difficulty in carrying out this provision, because it is the law in all the States at the present time. </para>

In the model State we have what is known as the homestead block system, which, in the course of a very few years, will be extended throughout the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- We do not; but in a district suitable for vine-growing there may be 200 or 300 of these small block holders owning from 10 to 20 acres of land each, and 5 acres would be a very large proportion to plant with vines. It might be a very great convenience, however, for one of these settlers to take out a vigneron's licence. It would enable him to serve his fellow settlers. There is no intention of increasing the number of small stills all over the place, with a consequent increase in the number of officers required for inspection purposes ; but I fail to see why a man with 3 acres under vines should not be able to take out one of these licences. A great many of his fellow settlers might be benefited under such circumstances. It has been stated that such a person might also be the owner of a winery, but there would be difficulties in the way of such a thing taking place in connexion with any of these settlements. I hope the Senate will agree to my amendment. </para>

                    <para>- In the first place, if the Government make any regulation, they may prescribe 50 degrees if they think fit. Then the officer is not to allow any spirits, unless they come up to 50 degrees, and he approves of them. So that there is first the operation of the regulation, if it is made, and then the approval of the officer of the particular mixture which is used. But, if no regulation is made, it is left entirely to the officer. There is, therefore, a double safeguard. Although many of us may agree that perhaps 30 degrees is exceedingly low, and that spirit of that quality should not be allowed to be used, still that is, I think, a matter that can be left to the officer. If a higher minimum than that were provided, it is quite clear that it would be an illusory sort of concession to make to these holders of small stills to let 'them have stills of 50 gallons, and not allow them to use the product of their stills, unless it was a product that had to be made with a good deal of expense and trouble to them. </para>

                        <para>-Col. NEILD (New South Wales). - I am not sufficiently versed in the intricacies of wine-making to know whether there is any difference achieved by the mixing of wines of different strengths with spirits of different strengths. It has occurred to me to be quite possible that spirit of a strength suitable for mixing with or fortifying the heavy or strong wines might be out of place in connexion with some of the light vintages, such as those of New South Wales, for instance, where the wines are perhaps lighter than those of any other part of Australia. I have in my hand a communication from a well known firm of experts in New South Wales. They inform me that they find that a spirit distilled to 20 per cent, is most useful and produces the best results. I will read a few words from this letter because it throws some light upon the matter. </para>

                <para>Every practical distiller knows that wine distilled to the strength of 30 per cent, over proof produces a comparatively neutral spirit robbed of its volatile ethers, and which gives bouquet and character to brandy as distinguished from rectified spirit. </para>
                <para>The writer goes on to say that he obtains the best results by distilling to a strength of 20 per cent, over proof. I find that another undoubted authority points out that, in order that the strength of 50 per cent, be maintained at the end of, say, six months, it would be necessary to produce spirit of over 57 per cent. That is, spirit that would have a proportion of 92½ per cent, of absolute alcohol. We surely do not desire to fortify our wines with spirit containing over 90 per cent, of absolute alcohol. Had it been possible to reduce the 30 degrees to 20 I should have moved in that direction, but inasmuch as the amendment now moved is with a view not of reducing the strength, but increasing it, it will be my duty in the interests of what I believe to be the welfare of the wine industry to resist the amendment, though I am sure we all respect the source from which it comes. I believe it had its origin in the Victorian Act, and as I have said it is possible that an alcoholic strength that may be very useful for the strong wines made in Victoria and South Australia would not be suitable for the light clarets and hocks produced in New South Wales. I shall vote for the clause as it stands in preference to the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- But the latter portion of clause 57 deals with the number of degrees above proof of spirit to be used for fortifying wines. If clause 57 does not govern clause 58, should there not be something in clause 58 to deal with the strength of the spirit to be used in fortifying Australian wines? It would appear to me that anybody might override the measure by claiming that clause 57 permitted the fortifying of wines with any spirit, providing he first got the officers's approval. </para>

                        <para>-On the point as to whether we should allow this, because a number of small still owners would not otherwise be able to use their stills, I am informed that these small stills may be altered at a very slight cost so as to increase the purity of the spirit distilled. I know that the vignerons of Victoria feel very strongly upon this point, and strongly urge that 50 degrees should be retained as originally introduced in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- But we should not get pure spirit distilled from other materials than wine at less than 60 per cent, over proof. That is what I want to get at. And I have shown that spirit produced from wine, .although it may not be pure spirit, does not contain anything that is injurious to the wine itself. If wine spirit had to be distilled up to 60 per cent, overproof, it would be so expensive that very little" of it would be used, and there would be no chance for it to compete with any other spirit. Clause 57, it appears to me, anticipates that wine may have been imported under certain conditions, and may be required to be 'fortified here. </para>

                        <para>- Not in regard to Australian wines, it is true, but they might with regard to imported wines of an inferior character. If we desire to protect the Australian growers, then should we not protect them by compelling those who wish to fortify imported wines to use a spirit of 60 degrees over proof ? I am inclined to think that there should be some amendment of clause 58 providing for 30 degrees above proof and over. I think that the words " 30 degrees above proof " in clause 57 are intended to refer to clause 58. When the Bill is passed the Australian wine producer may -claim that the latter clause .governs his wine, while clause 57 governs imported wines, and that the words " 30 degrees above proof " have nothing to do with Australian wines. </para>

                        <para>- No ; all wine, including Australian. The word " wine" is used there generally without any limitation. Therefore clause 57 will apply to Australian as well as to imported wine, with the result that a man cannot fortify wine at all, whether Australian or not, unless with a spirit approved by 'the officer, and of a strength of at least 30 degrees above proof. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to the first question there is no doubt that this clause goes pretty near the border line of what ought to be within our powers and what is not. If there is any doubt about the thing, however, we ought to be ready always to take powers which are in the interest of the health of the community and in the interest of the whole of Australia. If there is any doubt about our powers we ought to lean in the direction of exercising them in that way instead of standing back. I think myself there is no doubt that these powers will be held to be necessary for the purpose of carrying out excise laws. I find that there are many illustrations of the kind in the decisions of the United States Courts, where powers such as these have been held to be properly exercisable. In regard to the other question, clause 58 appears to me to absolutely protect Australian wines. The use of the word " pure " spirit implies as I understand from the expert of the distillation department who is here, that it is impossible to have pure wine spirit of 30 degrees over proof ; that the spirit must be considerably over 30, 40; or 50 degrees at the very least, otherwise it will not be pure. So that when we use the words "pure wine spirit " in the clause we command that whatever degree is necessary for a pure wine spirit shall be used ; that nothing but that must be used for fortifying Australian wine. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly. One difficulty in the way of applying this clause to wines other than Australian is, that we have no machinery for enforcing it in connexion with such wines. We have a right to send our inspectors to Australian vineyards, but we have no right to go into a wine and spirit merchant's premises and superintend the fortifying of wines there. </para>

                <para>In France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal and Spain, it is recognised that the purity of the spirit added to wine is of vital importance, and that to secure that purity the only means is to insist upon the rectification of the spirit to a high degree over proof. The source from which the spirit is distilled is not regarded in European, wine countries, for injurious spirit can be obtained as readily from wine, marc or lees, as from potatoes or other sources. Safety is found only in the prohibition of spirits of a low grade. In Austro-Hungary the standard is 66 degrees over proof. </para>
                <para>And in Italy 66'4 if distilled from grain, potatoes, or sugar refuse ; 57 "8 if distilled from fruits, and 49'1 if distilled from sound wine. In Spain no spirit distilled from wine can be used if less than 50 degrees over proof, and other European countries insist upon a similar standard. </para>

                    <para>It is recognised that fortifying to a certain extent, is necessary in certain cases, but the practice is one which in the best interests of the industry ought to be kept within bounds. In France the fortification of dry wines is prohibited, and in Germany the fortification must not increase the volume by more than one per cent. The law in Hungary prohibits increasing the volume by fortification more than two per cent., and although rectified potato or grain spirit is legal, spirit derived from marc or lees is prohibited for fortification. </para>

                    <para>The wines, in fact, are somewhat crude in character ; they do not possess delicacy. The amount of spirit considerably exceeds the normal amount in the corresponding French wines. It is possible that spirit is added as a necessity for keeping the wine in sound condition during transport. . . . We do not doubt that the quality of these colonial wines will improve in time in the important respects of delicacy of flavour and lightness of alcoholic strength. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt there is a certain amount of evaporation. Our people in South Australia are quite willing to leave it to the- officer to say whether the spirit is sufficiently pure to mix with wines, The statement continually made that if people are to be allowed to fortify their wines with what spirit they like, the wine trade will be destroyed, is all moonshine. I suppose that, no State of the group has a better reputation for wines than South Australia. South Australian wine " takes the path." It "needs no bush" - though what "bush" means I do not know. In South Australia we have been allowing people to fortify their wines with any ordinary spirit. So far as I know, there lias been no limitation as to the degree of spirit so long as it is silent spirit. There has been no restriction as to whether it shall be made from potatoes or sugar, or any other material, so long as the spirit is absolutely flavourless. "We trusted to the flavour of the wine, and not to the flavour of the spirit put in to help the wine. But I am told - and have noticed myself - that there is a marked difference, so far as the bouquet and taste are concerned, between spirit made from wine and from potatoes. When made from potatoes, the spirit has a disagreeable smell and a decidedly disagreeable flavour, but when made from wine the spirit has a pleasant bouquet. There can be no doubt that in the fortification of wines good brandy is the very best material that can be used, and that it imparts to the wine a bouquet and flavour which it might otherwise possibly lack. There is a great art in wine-making and in distilling, and it is only those who study it thoroughly who make a success of it. I think we might strike out the clause altogether. There is no absolute necessity for it. The matter might be left at clause 58, which provides that no spirit other than pure wine spirit shall be used for the fortification of wine. I deny, however, that the wine trade is going to be injured if other spirit is used. In South Australia wines are frequently fortified with silent spirit. Of late years we have been making excellent brandy, and most of our large wine-makers have their own stills, and manufacture their own wine spirit for the purpose of fortifying it. Therefore, it would be very much disapproved in South Australia if the degree of proof were raised to 50 degrees above proof. They contend that if the spirit is distilled up to 50 degrees, not only is there taken out of the wine some little fusel oil and other impurities, but also some of the bouquet and flavour. If good silent spirit is put in the wine it does not matter whether it is made from sugar, potatoes, wheat, barley, oats or refuse of any sort, so long as it is rectified. If any honorable senator will move to omit clause 57 I shall support such an amendment ; otherwise I shall vote for the clause as it stands. Clause 58 is quite sufficient. We can trust to the Custom-house officers and the Government to make such regulations as are necessary. The officers may be trusted to act in such a lenient way as will permit the fortification of wine by the use of brand}', which is undoubtedly the best spirit that can be used. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the view of that which the Government takes. If that is what they are relying on, it ought to be made perfectly clear, and we ought to eliminate clause 57 altogether, because it is entirely misleading so far as the Australian wine-grower is concerned. Then, I think, in clause 58 we ought to strike out the word " pure." </para>

As to the use of the words "pure wine spirit" I have explained what will be the view taken by the Government officials. It is only right that the committee should know that. If there is any ambiguity about the use of the words, if it is thought that by leaving too wide a discretion we may shut out the fortifying of wine with spirits that might safely be used, that is a question different from that in this clause. I hope, however, that clause 57 will be carried in the form in which it stands. </para>

                    <para>Every gallon of grain or potato spirits used for fortifying wine would take the place of 5 gallons of wine, it being necessary to distil this quantity in order to produce one gallon of grape spirit. As grain spirit can be manufactured at less than half the cost of pure grape spirit, it would be manifestly unfair to allow it to be brought into free competition with grape spirit for a purpose for which only grape spirit can legitimately be used. </para>
                    <para>The free use of cheap potato and grain spirit will induce producers of inferior wines to fortify them, and place them on the market instead of sending them to the distillery. If only pure grape spirit were allowed to be used for fortifying wine, low class wines would be of value for distillation purposes, but they would be of no value for distillation if grape spirit were brought into unrestricted competition with grain and potato spirits, and thus these low-class wines would in turn be fortified and be submitted for human consumption. </para>
                    <para>There can be no question as to the results that will follow the unrestricted use of spirits for wine fortification. The effect will be to render nugatory much of the effort and expenditure that has been directed to the improvement of our wine, and to the building up of a wholesome reputation at home and abroad for the products of our vineyards. The distiller of grain and potato spirit will be encouraged at the expense of the vigneron and the general public. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment which has just been carried will make it necessary to have some alteration in this clause. As I said a. little while ago, according to my reading of the clause as it stands, pure wine spirit means spirit made from wine of a strength of at least between. 40 and 50 per cent, and if that meaning were attached to it, it would be either in direct contradiction of clause 57, or it would put the Australian wine-grower in a very disadvantageous position. I do not think any of us want that. My objection to the amendment which has been carried rested simply on the ground that it appeared to me the Australian wine-grower was fully protected under clause 58. Since that amendment has been carried it is necessary to amend clause 58. If it is made quite clear that wine spirit simply means spirit made from wine without any foreign admixture there will be no necessity to put in anything about the percentage of alcohol at all. Clause 57 would then fix the percentage of alcohol subject to the regulation and the approval of the officer. We would, therefore, put Australian wine on exactly the same footing as any other wine, with the limitation only that the wine spirit used must be at least 30 degrees above proof. I take it, it would be sufficient to speak of wine spirit, and the word "pure" might be struck out. </para>

                        <para>- To leave the word " pure " in raises the difficulty I pointed out before, that "pure " spirit may be thought to mean that there shall be no deleterious admixture in it, and that cannot be got unless we have a spirit of something like 40 or 50 degrees above proof. The amendment I suggest is really consequential upon the amendment which has been made in clause 57, and is, I think, the best way to carry out the views of the committee. </para>

                    <para>- I think there is very great danger in striking out out the word "pure," and if it is struck out a very bad impression will be given to everybody. There is another way in which the Vice-President of the Executive Council might amend the clause without running any risk whatever. That way is simply to repeat in this clause the words he has used in clause 57, and the clause would then read - </para>

                        <para>- I do not know how the vendor of the spirits will be able to ascertain the strength. When he buys the spirits they are not certified or guaranteed to him to be of a certain strength. I propose to insert the word " knowingly " so as to make the clause apply to a person who knowingly does what the clause is intended to provide against. The amendment will also apply to the second sub-clause dealing with the sale of any Australian wine containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. I am again at a loss to understand how the vendor can be supposed to know the percentage of spirit in the wine he buys, which may be purchased in bulk or in bottle. He cannot be expected to test all the wine. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I shall strongly oppose the amendment. It seems to me that to insert such an amendment in the clause will be to destroy its value. There is nothing new in this kind of legislation, and these provisions are to be found in all the Health Acts under which, in the public interest, to secure that there shall be pure wine or pure articles of any other kind, we put the duty on the person who sells them of seeing that they are pure. He has an opportunity of finding that out, and if he does not do so he must take the responsibility. On the other hand if we could not convict a man unless we could prove that he knew the article he sold was not what it ought to be we could not convict him at all. The same principle is followed out in the Customs and Excise Acts. </para>

                    <para>- I proposed the reconsideration of schedules I. and II. in consequence of the recommittal of clause 10 on the question of licences. It is not needed now, but I might point out that the fees proposed to be charged under schedule I, are excessively high as compared with past experience in the State of Victoria. A spirit maker's licence-fee is to be £50. In Victoria it is £10. The wine spirit maker's licence fee is fixed at £25, and in Victoria it is only £10. </para>

There may be one officer to several distilleries, and in the case of wine distillers' licences, there will probably be one officer to look after several premises. There cannot be any hardship in giving 48 hours' notice. The object of giving that notice is to enable the officer to so arrange his business that he will be able to be there when the operation is going on. If we do not have a notice of as long as 48 hours, the result will be that we shall have either to keep a larger number of officers, or to throw the business into a great deal of confusion. There is nothing unusual, I understand, in requiring 48 hours' notice. </para>

                        <para>- JOSIAH SYMON.- Yes, of the process, but that is not defined. It says the spirit receiver, of not less than 60 gallons capacity must be kept in the spirit store. That is the only provision which at all bears comparison with regulation 44. I think that there must be some confusion about it. At any rate the distillers who have communicated with me on the subject say that it appears to them to be contradictory. Regulation 4.4 quite applies to the same kind of distilleries as is comprehended under the regulations headed vignerons' licences. It is quite clear that it refers to a wine distillery. If the capacity were reduced. from 80 gallons to 60 gallons it would make the two fit in and be consistent. </para>

                        <para>- It will be necessary to leave these regulations as they are. There is- m&gt; doubt that they want a little explanation. One requires to understand something of the processes. I have just been making an inquiry and have been furnished with an explanation. Regulation 44 applies, as I have said, to. the general distiller. It expressly says that each vat in a spirit store must be of a certain capacity, of not less than 200 gallons, and in the case of a wine distillery of not less than 80 gallons. That is a receptacle for the purpose of storing spirits. They are to be kept in that spirit store. In the spirit store in an ordinary distillery, the feints receiver is not kept, but it is provided in the case of a vigneron's premises he must keep the feints receiver and the spirit receiver in his spirit store. The feints receiver and spirit receiver are parts of the machinery, but they are parts of machinery which must be kept in the vigneron's store. </para>

                    <para>- I think 50 gallons is the largest sized still used by vignerons in New South Wales, and in some cases the stills are smaller. It would be a fair thing to reduce the size of these stills to 35 gallons. That would necessitate a further amendment reducing the exhaustion capacity from 20 gallons to 15, which would maintain the existing proportions. This is a concession which might fairly be granted in respect of the vine-growers who either have licences or require to have them. In some States vineyards are not contiguous to one another, and it is not an easy thing to arrange for a still to be used in combination by two or three vignerons. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I cannot accept this amendment. The limit of 50 gallons has been fixed as the lowest to which it is thought wise to allow the operations of the vignerons to go. Though it is true that there are some cases in New South Wales where there are stills of a smaller capacity already licensed, yet it has to be remembered that they are not to be interfered with. Clauses 24 and 25 of this Bill provide that nothing is to prevent the granting of licences to such stills as before, but it is unwise to multiply small stills, in which it is difficult to produce good spirit. Their multiplication makes the task of inspection greater, and also makes it more difficult to collect duty. </para>

                        <para>- There is no hardship whatever on the owner of a vineyard, because a vigneron who makes more spirit than he needs can sell it to his neighbours. He will consider before he gets his licence whether it is worth his while to get a licence or not, and whether, if he makes more spirit than he needs, he will be able to sell it. Considering that vested interests are protected by the Bill there is no need to pass the amendment. </para>

                <para>In addition to the extra cost entailed by having to obtain larger stills, the erection of a building to comply with the provisions of the Act will also tend to increase the hardship of our growers, who under the Act in force in this State, have had a limit placed upon the capacity of their stills which will have to be put aside as useless to their business if the proposed Act is passed. This will entail great loss to them, seeing that no provision is made for compensation. In addition those growers, who have been fortifying their wines and have gathered a business connexion, will have to start again and will be unable to compete against the neighbouring States. </para>
