                    <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. I think that every honorable senator, no matter what are his views as to the principle on which customs duties should be levied, is of opinion that it is of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth that all reasonable means should be taken for the securing of the due collection of the revenue, and for protecting the honest trader, in his dealings with the Customs-house, against the persons who - although there are not many of them - in all the States continually endeavour to gain advantage over their honest fellow traders by frauds through the Customs-house. This is a measure which, I think it will be admitted, does nothing more than carry out in a legitimate way the principles of the Acts in force in the different States. I would ask the special consideration of the Senate to the necessity for passing it into law at the earliest possible date. It is one of those machinery measures which are absolutely essential to the carrying on of the business of the Commonwealth, and its need is very special, because until it becomes law it will be impossible for the Government to introduce the Tariff, which the whole ; of Australia is so anxiously waiting for. The Government are fully alive to the necessity of placing the Tariff before the country at the earliest possible date, and so soon as this Bill, the Excise Bill, and probably the Distillation Bill, become law steps will be taken for bringing the Tariff under the consideration of Parliament. No doubt some clauses of this Bill may produce debate. The great bulk of them ought to produce no debate, because they are simply repetitions in different form of enactments which are in force in the different States, and which have been in force in the United Kingdom for a great many years. But some of the clauses may lead to some debate, and as there must be a measure of this kind, as it is one which I think the Senate will agree to on its general principles, I would suggest that wherever possible the discussion of particular clauses should be reserved for committee. We all recognise that we must, as far' as possible, discuss these measures in a businesslike way in committee, and spend no more time than is absolutely necessary for seeing that legislation leaves this Chamber in proper form. This Bill is in substance the same as the Acts which are in force in all the States, and is really founded on the legislation of the United Kingdom as consolidated in the Customs Act of 1876. Those who have had anything to do with customs legislation or with the working of the Custom-house, are aware that it is necessary in all customs laws to give very stringent powers to the officers of customs, and to deal with customs offences in an exceptional way. It is necessary to deal with the legal procedure regarding Customs in an exceptional way, and this necessity has been recognised in all the different systems of Customs derived from the United Kingdom. In the Bill the provisions of all these different measures are carried out in the manner I have indicated ; but as to the form of the measure, it will be recognised that there has been a very desirable departure from the stereotyped form of ordinary Acts of Parliament. The most devoted personal labour of -my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, has been given to this measure, and throughout every line of it we can recognise the hand of one who is, perhaps, the leading parliamentary draftsman of Australia. As a: piece of draftsmanship, the Bill is a model of conciseness and clearness, and, although we cannot identify all the particular sections of other Acts as they appear, the Bill, although it is terse, embodies in substance the legislation in existence in the States Customs Acts, and in the Customs Act of the United Kingdom. In order to make the explanation of the Bill clearer as I go on, I would like to call attention to some of the methods which the Minister for Trade and Customs has used in order to very much shorten the ordinary phraseology of Acts of Parliament. For instance, it will be noticed that at the end of some of the clauses - take, for instance, clause 19 - -there is a laconic statement, " Penalty, £20." Those words are by clause 5 stated to mean that that is the maximum penalty for the commission of an offence against the provisions of the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I am saying that the term " ships' stores " has acquired a technical meaning, and that when it is used in this clause it is to be taken to have that meaning. The rule which has been followed in these States in regard to ships' stores has been this. In the first place in all the States coasting vessels have had to pay duty on all the stores and provisions they consumed just as though they were in harbor during the whole course of their voyage. It has also been the rule that in Inter-State trade - or intercolonial trade as it was then- ships' stores have been allowed duty free, for the reason that each State was a foreign State to the others, and therefore treated a voyage as though it were a voyage of a foreign ship going abroad. So that before federation all the coasters paid duty on all goods which we're consumed by them during the course of' their voyage, however lengthy it might be, and all intercolonial ships were free of duty iri regard to the consumption of goods between one port and another. But a difference has been made by the advent of federation,- inasmuch as the whole of Australia has become one Customs area. Therefore these lines of demarcation between the different States as regards Customs systems having disappeared, it seems reasonable that the difference between the coaster and. the Inter-State trader is no longer founded upon any substantial ground. Consequently it would appear that the Inter-State vessel trading from one State to another, or taking a round of the States, should be treated upon the same footing as the coaster. That is to say, we should either give the ' coaster free stores or charge both the coaster and Inter-State trader. It appears to the Government that that position is obvious. But when we come to deal with a foreign ship, or a British ship from abroad, which carries on coasting trade - that is to say,- proceeds from one port to another throughout Australia - we are in this position. If we treat the trader that comes from Great Britain or from a foreign port as a foreign ship, and put him on a different footing to the Inter-State trader, we place our Inter-State trader in a very unfair position. We give a foreign ship, or a British ship that comes from abroad to the same ports as our Inter-State traders go to, an unfair advantage. When it is remembered that a large number of foreign shipping companies already have the advantage of large subsidies, which enable them to run their business very much more cheaply than Australian shipping businesses can be conducted, that still further emphasizes the unfairness of putting those vessels which come from Great Britain or from foreign countries in a more advantageous position with regard to competition than our own Inter-State traders. There are only two ways of dealing with the question. Either we must charge these foreign ships which trade around our coasts duty upon their stores in the same way as we charge Inter-State vessels and coasters, or we must let them all go free. If we let them all go free it means that the Customs department will lose something like £60,000 a year in duty. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly it would hold good if there was any necessity to carry it out. If we come down to the first principles of law on the matter, if a ship brings goods into a port,whether they are ships' stores, goods for import, or goods to be carried on, those goods, all the time they are in port, are under the control of the Customs officers.Itis that power of control which enables the Commonwealth to deal with these goods in the way proposed, and which would enable the Customhouse officials of the United Kingdom, if they thought fit for any reason, to deal with goods in precisely the same way. There is no doubt about the legal basis of it, and the practicability of it, and if it has not been done before it is because the occasion has not arisen. Now the occasion has arisen under these new circumstances in which we must either lose £60,000 a year at least in revenue or carry out this provision, which, as I say, really does not involve any hardship upon any person concerned, and which, if we do not carry it out in regard to foreign ships, will put our own traders and coasters in a very disadvantageous position. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt, as the honorable and learned senator says, that it must apply to .foreign-going ships all round. I see no reason why it should not apply equally in the case of British ships and foreign-owned ships, because if the foreign-owned ship has the power to disregard the seal of the Customs authorities the British ship has precisely the same power. </para>

                            <para>- There is no question about that. As to whether the laws of the Commonwealth apply to these particular goods, we do not rely in this matter upon section 5 of the Constitution at all. It does not apply to ships' stores, and it . is only by virtue of the power of control over these goods that we claim this right. I have thought it necessary to refer to this matter, though it is to some extent one of detail, because it is of some importance, and is a departure from the old and existing rules in the different States, lt is a departure justified by the condition of things, and is the only course which it appeal's to the Government that they can possibly take in dealing with the question which has arisen for solution. There are other provisions in the Bill giving the power to prevent smuggling, and for the protection of officers, and those subjects are dealt with upon the lines on which they are usually dealt with in such an enactment. There is only one matter connected with them to which I think it necessary to call the attention of the Senate, and that is referred to in clauses 217 and 218. It will be noticed that the preceding clauses are clauses dealing with proceedings against officers. Clause 213 provides for a month's notice of action to be given before any action is brought against an officer. Clause 216 provides for the usual six months' limitation in bringing an action. If an action is not brought within six months, the right of action goes. Exactly on the same lines are clauses 217 and 218, which are as follow: - </para>

                            <para>- I dare say where the legal right has been claimed it has been done, but the honorable senator is aware that while that is so, the constitutional practice has also been recognised, particularly in one case which occurred in New South Wales where an appeal was made to the discretion of the court. In that case the court was placed in such a position that it might exercise a discretion to grant relief or not, and the court said if it had been applied to on the naked legal grounds, it could only have given one answer, but inasmuch as it was asked to exercise a power which it had the discretion to refuse, if it thought fit - as this well-known constitutional usage was for the protection of the revenue, and the only way in which the revenue could be protected under the circumstances - it would not exercise the power in favour of any person who claimed injury from the application of that constitutional usage. The question does not always arise in that form. It might arise in the form in which a person complains against a higher duty being collected from him than he is entitled to pay under existing law, or that duty has been collected from him in regard to an article which is free according to the existing law, and if such a question was brought before a court, only one answer could be given to it. It is to prevent persons taking advantage of that condition of things that provision is made here for the protection of an officer, as described in these two clauses. The result will be that when the Bill is passed it will provide for legalizing all that has been done and indemnifying the officer, and if the Bill is not passed no harm will be done by the delay, because an action can still be brought, and the person who makes the claim that he has been illegal! v treated will succeed. It will be seen that these provisions arise out of the necessity of the circumstances, and give only a reasonable protection to. officers,' a reasonable protection in the collection of revenue, and at the same time do no substantial injustice to any one. Under these circumstances, the Government thought that the way in which this question is dealt with was the only practicable and reasonable way in which it could be treated, and so that provision is embodied in the Bill. There was another proposal, which I need not deal with now. The whole question is involved in a great deal of difficulty, and this appeared to the Government to be the best way out of it. Of course, in the inception of our legislation, we shall find ourselves frequently confronted with great difficulties. We have to get over them, as the British people have always got over such difficulties in the exercise of the right of self-government - in a reasonable, common-sense way, and that is a ground on which we appeal to- the Senate for. the sanction of this method of overcoming what I think will be admitted is a difficulty which had to be-faced. I do not think there are any other parts of the Bill which I need refer to in detail. It will be found that it contains a number of provisions, dealing with the punishment of offences and the trial of Customs offences, and that the rule has been followed which- has always been followed in. similar legislation - that is, to put a Customs offence in a somewhat different position from any other offence under the criminal law or quasi-criminal law. Under the criminal law, or the quasi-criminal law, or under other circumstances, a man who charges another with an offence subject to a penalty has to prove that he is guilty, but under these laws the mere fact of the event having happened as charged by the Customs officials is- taken to be proof, and the onus of disproving that is put upon the other party. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to the customs law it has been found to be necessary by scores of years of usage ; it has been sanctioned by the practice of the United Kingdom and by every State, and I think the honorable senator will find that, speaking generally, there is nothing here which is not to be found in all those systems of legislation which deal with Customs and the prevention of fraud at the Customs. In committee I shall be able to deal with these matters more in detail ; I only mention them now because it is necessary to state the general principle which is applicable to all such matters. Honorable senators, therefore, need not be surprised if they find that Customs offences are dealt with, in regard to their procedure, in a somewhat different way from other offences against the law. I hope that the Senate will find no difficulty in passing the second reading of the measure, and that in going through its clauses it will be found that, whilst every provision is made to protect the revenue, there is nothing of which the honest trader need be afraid. Its main object is to collect revenue, but it is also an object to protect the honest trader - that is, the man who conscientiously pays his duties - in competition with the dishonest person who seeks to gain an advantage by carrying ou systems of fraud through, the Customs. It has been, found necessary, in' order to meet these various devices; to follow them by many different provisions. It will be found that the provisions here are no more stringent than the provisions in similar measures, but at the same time they, are cleat, and as stringent as is necessary </para>

The provision I allude to is that which makes an accused person not only competent, but compellable to give evidence - liable to be called at the instance of the prosecution, and, what seems to be still more drastic, and still more opposed to our notions of the humane administration of British law, if called by the prosecution, liable to cross-examination as an adverse witness. That certainly is a very serious innovation. </para>

                            <para>- It is undoubtedly limited. The only exceptions are two, namely, an indictable offence, and an offence directly punishable by imprisonment. Nobody can have any possible objection to the practice, common under Acts of this description, of throwing on an accused in certain cases the onus of proving his own innocence. But I do object, even in the case of a fine, to compelling a man to go into a box and subjecting him to cross-examination at the instance of the prosecution, thus, it may be, compelling him to incriminate himself. </para>

                            <para>- It is assuming that the man is a criminal. The provision compels a man, contrary to every known, principle of British law, to go into the box, on the assumption that he is guilty, and incriminate himself. We are not subjecting him to an ordinary examination in trying to ascertain the facts of the case, but we put him into the hands of counsel for the prosecution and subject him to cross-examination. If it is proposed to do a. tiling of this kind, it is a great innovation. One of the best reforms we have had in English criminal law during recent years has been that for enabling an accused person to give evidence on his own behalf - that is, making . him competent to give evidence. I do not think it has ever been suggested that a man, under the circumstances, should be compelled to subject himself to cross-examination at the instance of the prosecuting counsel, and be examined as an adverse and hostile witness. </para>

                            <para>- Probably it does, but I want to strongly differentiate between the two. I am not saying the contention is right, but it might be contended that under covering section 5 of the Constitution Act, the laws of the Commonwealth have force on board British ships whose first point of clearance and port of destination are within the Commonwealth. I do not want to say anything exhaustively on the subject at present, but it might be contended that ships touching at Fremantle, and then clearing for Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, come within the operation of the laws under that covering clause, if they are British ships. We cannot, of course, pretend to settle these fine questions in this Chamber or in Parliament, but in the case of a foreign ship it seems quite clear that once it is on the high seas our shipping and customs laws cannot operate. </para>

The other provisions to which attention is called are contained in clauses 217 and 218, called the protective clauses.

Hitherto, the constitutional usage has been acted on, I think, in some of the colonies, without any resolution at all. </para>

                            <para>- On making the financial statement, and by an executive act. Of course, all this is open to the charge of illegality, and it is undoubtedly illegal in the strictly technical sense; but it is done for the protection of the revenue. As my honorable and learned friend has pointed out, in one instance, where a case caine into court, the Judges, exercising what was undoubtedly a wise discretion in the public interest, although perhaps bound as a matter of rigid law, declined to interfere, as, of course, the necessities of the State demanded that they should not interfere if they could possibly avoid doing so. But it is well, at the same time, and is an excellent reform, that the point should be set at rest, and that a provision of this kind should stand in a Customs Bill of this description, so as to prevent the possibility of these actions being brought at all - pending, of course, the actual enactment of the Tariff; and that if they are to be brought, they shall be brought under the conditions laid down in the Bill with regard to security being given. Therefore, this clause is not applicable only to the first Tariff of the Commonwealth, but to any Tariff. It will stand for all time. If any Tariff alterations are made, and the collection of duties is undertaken by reason of an Executive act or by resolution of Parliament this clause will apply. These are the only provisions to which J need trouble to call the attention of honorable senators. I can only say, in conclusion, that this Bill is admirably drafted. Without undue disparagement of any other Bill that has come before the Senate, I say that this is the first Bill to which that epithet can be applied. Whether we agree with some portions of the measure or not, it is certain that no one can read these clauses without plainly seeing the intention of the draftsman, and what will be the intention of the Legislature. The language used throughout the Bill is of such a character as to convey lucidly and effectively the purposes for which the clauses are designed, and the intention which the measure purposes to carry out. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill being chiefly a machinery Bill, I think it will be better for the Senate to discuss it briefly at this stage, in order that we may get into committee as soon as possible. 1 desire to add my testimony to the admirable manner in which the Bill has been drafted. It is really a treat to read it through. The only fault I have to find is the absence of the usual marginal notes. There is not a single note from beginning to end of the Bill, and thus an extra amount of trouble has been thrown upon those honorable senators who have taken the pains to go through it carefully. </para>

                            <para>- It has been the practice in regard to other Bills introduced to have marginal notes, and it would certainly have saved me a great amount of trouble if that had been done in reference to this Bill. There is no doubt that this is a drastic Bill, but I agree with the leader of the Senate that it is absolutely necessary in connexion with Customs-house legislation that very large powers should be given, both to the Minister and the collector of Customs. [ But those powers should also be accompanied by facilities for appeal. There are sure to be honest differences of opinion as to whether certain goods come under one rate of duty or another, or whether they are dutiable at all or free. I have known most ludicrous examples of such differences of opinion - ludicrous to those who knew the trade and the class of goods concerned. The Minister of Customs was perfectly honest in the decision he came to, though that decision afterwards had to be altered. This Bill does not go quite far enough in giving some fairly easy mode of appeal. I am aware that it states that in the event of there being a difference of opinion on a certain point, the Minister is . to decide, and then the duty has to be paid under protest. But what is the next course ? An action may be brought against the Government. It very often happens that the amount in dispute is so comparatively small, as compared with the trouble, delay, and expense in connexion with an action, that people would rather pay, although knowing that payment was absolutely contrary to the Act and to common sense. If there was a reasonable means of appeal - say to the Minister, so that he might have an opportunity of reconsidering his decision, it would be a great improvement on the Bill as it stands. I throw out that suggestion to the leader of the Senate, in order that he may see whether he cannot meet the wishes of a large majority of the mercantile community, at any rate so far as "Victoria is concerned. Other honorable senators will, no doubt, be able to speak for the other States. </para>

                            <para>- It has to be borne in mind that in the past every State has been self-contained, and the collector's decision . has been the decision of the Minister. But in future the Minister must necessarily delegate to the collectors very much of his powers or there will be a dead-lock. The collector will give a decision, acting, to use a common phrase, as an attorney for the Minister, and we want an appeal to the Minister himself from the collector. </para>

                            <para>- That is a different case altogether - where a charge is brought against an importer and he submits himself. That is similar to a provision in the Post-office Bill. But there needs to be a comparatively easy way of getting the decision of the collector revised by the Minister. I have known many cases where a decision given in Victoria has been so revised, and rightly so. I have also to call attention to the fact that the charges on the present bonds have been considerably altered since the Bill was introduced in another place. After consulting with those who are intimately connected with this matter, I have submitted some slight amendments which I think will meet the case, and will practically bring the charges for these warehouses almost into line with the present practice. The matter will be dealt with in committee ; I merely mention it because the subject is creating a great deal of attention. There is a large amount of capital invested in these general warehouses - something like £300,000 in Victoria alone. Another clause in the Bill - a very small one - deals with blank invoices. I have read it carefully, and my opinion is that it is not by any means stringent enough. I allude to clause 153. In order to meet similar cases in Victoria an Act was passed, and in the amendments I have prepared I have copied sections 10, 11, 12, and 13 of that Act, which is No. 1471. The amendments go a great deal further than this . Bill, and will, I think, give far greater protection to the Custom-house, which is the 'first thing we have to see to, whilst they will also give greater protection to the honest trader. Those are the two points 'we have to keep in 'mind in dealing with this Bill. I venture to ask the leader of the Senate to look at ray amendments. With regard to the special stores - a matter which has been fully dealt with - I recognise the fairness of the proposition of the Government that those who bring goods into the Commonwealth, and seek to consume them in the Commonwealth, should be - placed on the same footing as our own people who own vessels for coasting purposes. I recognise the equity of the proposal of the Bill. The only difficulty is whether it is practicable to.carry it out. That is a point which will have to be thrashed out in committee. If it can be done I not only see no reason why it should not become law, but every reason why it should. With regard to clauses 217 and 2 18,whichhavebeen very fully dealt with by the leader of the Senate, there is one point he did not answer, and which appears to me to be important. The clauses deal with the collection of duties after a resolution has been passed by one House. That has been the practice in all the States in the past. </para>

So soon as fresh duties are collected by the laying of the Tariff on the table of the House of Representatives, will the State duties cease, or will the duties be uniform throughout the States ? If not we shall have the Customs department practically collecting both duties. </para>

                            <para>- I would ask the honorable and learned gentleman to look carefully into the matter. The only other provision to which I wish to allude is clause 245, which compels an importer who has been trying to evade the payment of duty to give evidence and submit to cross-examination. I have no objection to that provision. I believe unhesitatingly that if the importer be an honest man he will not have the slightest difficulty in quickly proving his innocence. If he be dishonest and bos been trying to evade payment of customs duties, I cannot conceive why he should not be examined. Although this is a change in our procedure, I see no objection to placing the importer in the box and asking him questions. It is a protection to the revenue and also to the honest trader ; and, although these clauses are certainly stringent, I unhesitatingly affirm that no honest importer need fear questioning. The more questions are put to him the easier it will be for him to clear himself from the charge. With these few remarks I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill, and shall assist in getting it passed through committee. </para>

                            <para>- I call it fraud, because defrauding the revenue is as much fraud as defrauding an individual ; although as one honorable senator has said, there are some curious conventions of conscience on that subject. I prefer to call it fraud, but I will not quibble about terms, and I shall say that that principle and rule is simply to prevent loss of revenue, and it has been added to the Constitution to such an extent that Judges have adjourned cases in view of the matter being before the Legislature. </para>

                            <para>- And what we do in all our States. When we impose fresh duties we also collect the higher duties of the existing Tariff, so that the revenue shall not stand to lose. I want to know what difference it will make because we happen not only to have a Commonwealth, but to have separate States as well ? I may be told that we cannot prevent the States collecting their duties. It is the simplest thing in the world. The officers of the States have become officers of the Commonwealth, and there is no State collection of duty because the Commonwealth takes control of all Customs. The moment it imposes duties, the Commonwealth takes control of all Customs officers. </para>

I am dealing with the subject arising out of that, and I say first of all that in my opinion we could have done without the clause at all, because I think the usage of the Constitution would allow all that is required to be done. In the next place I am, perhaps gratuitously, expressing my opinion that whatever the Government of Great Britain could have done in Great Britain, or whatever the colony of Victoria could have done in the colony of Victoria, the Commonwealth can do throughout the whole of Australia. </para>

                    <para>SenatorSir JOHN DOWNER.- No; there is just the fallacy I want to clear up. When the Treasurer of one of the colonies brought down a Tariff, or when the Chancellor of the Exchequer brought down a Tariff, he did not only collect the duties imposed under the Tariff, but the highest duties in force, including the duties imposed by that Tariff. Still he does not collect two Tariffs. He collects the duties imposed by his own. Tariff, plus the difference in amount between his Tariff and the existing Tariff, where the duties under the existing Tariff are higher than those which he proposes. I know if I were Treasurer I should not hesitate to do that. </para>

                            <para>- I have abandoned that matter, and I wish only to say a word on the subject of the powers the Customs authorities have conferred upon them to throw upon a defendant the onus of explaining his position. I think I introduced the first Bill that ever was introduced iii any British dominion which enabled a criminal to give evidence at all in his own behalf, and I had a bitter fight about that. But when I brought in the Bill I wanted to make him compellable as well as competent, because I thought the old Star Chamber days, when a question was put by means of the rack, had long gone by, and that in an open above-board proceeding, where the public eye is on every movement, there is no necessity in the world why a man should not be examined as to his misdeeds. An insolvent has to be examined as a. condition of his discharge, and he can criminate himself out of his own mouth, and constantly does, and I did not conceive, and I do not conceive now, any reason why other persons who are guilty of criminal offences should be placed in a position to say, "I decline to criminate myself." I say to a man, " Exculpate yourself, sir, if you can ; criminate yourself if you must." But these Customs offences are offences of a peculiar character, relating to a matter in which there has been a very lax -morality on the part of the general public. </para>

But be that as it may in the case of Customs offences where the morality is of the laxest character, it is highly expedient that we should give the Customs authorities the fullest power of investigation, and throw on the person accused the fullest opportunity of proving his innocence. </para>

                            <para>- It would be better to take the chance of something important being overlooked than to place such strong power in the hands of any Government, who, in consequence of pressure of work or intentionally, might decide not to bother with regulations during the session, but to wait until other business had been disposed of. As to anything being overlooked, it would be just as reasonable to give the Government power to amend the law during recess, if the provisions were found to be faulty. Important leakages might be found to exist under this Bill, but we would have to wait until Parliament met before amendments could be made. Legislation by an Executive is one of the most dangerous classes of legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I am voicing the opinion of a large section of the people of the Commonwealth when I say they disagree with a provision such as this. They want the regulations put before Parliament so that they may be dealt with forthwith, and so that there may be no legislation enacted by the Government without the authorization of Parliament. Under the Bill we find that many things may be prescribed by the Minister by means of regulations. Under clause 49, the importation of certain goods may be prohibited by proclamation, but I contend that no proclamation of this character should be permitted without the authority of Parliament. This clause is a regular drag-net, and enables the Minister to prohibit anything whatever ; and from beginning to end the Bill bristles with opportunities for the Minister to surprise not only the country, but Parliament, in matters he may provide for by regulation or proclamation. It is not right or proper to place such a wide power in the hands of the Minister, and it would be wise if Parliament laid down in all Bills the principle that regulations', other than those dealing with- procedure or forms, should have no effect until they have been before Parliament for approval for a period of fifteen or thirty days. Under clause 49, the Minister is given power to prohibit "all goods " by proclamation. That is really placing in the hand of the Minister, at the time when Parliament is not sitting, and the people of the Commonwealth are powerless, the right to prohibit the importation of articles which Parliament might never have considered it necessary to prohibit. Amongst the prohibited imports I find " oleomargarine, butterine, or any similar substitute for butter "; but while there is this prohibition these very articles are manufactured in, I understand, some of the States, and no attempt is made to provide against the latter. These matters should really be dealt with in a Public Health Bill or an Adulteration of Foods Bill. There ought to be laws to prevent a man selling goods deleterious to public health or selling butterine and calling it butter ; but, so far as I am aware, oleomargerine and butterine are perfectly healthy substances. There is no ques-0 tion that false money, blasphemous, or indecent works, or articles, and any works which infringe copyright should be prohibited. Exhausted tea and spurious tea leaf could very well be dealt with under an Adulteration of Foods Bill; but we recognise these are things which are spoken of as unfit for human use or unwholesome, and it might fairly be argued that they should be prohibited in a Bill of this character. We all recognise that it is very desirable to pass this Bill and also the Excise Bill and Distillation Bill as early as possible. At the same time that is no reason why these Bills should not be fully discussed in this Chamber. The Customs Bill was a very long time before the other Chamber, night after night being occupied in dealing with it. Whether the Bill was there pushed on with very great activity or not, the duty of the Senate is to deal with the measure fully, and not hurry over the consideration of the clauses simply because the Government or honorable senators want to deal with the Tariff Bill. There are very important provisions in the measure, and I clare say we shall find important provisions in the other measures which have been referred to, and I therefore hope the Senate will take the fullest opportunity for considering and dealing with the clauses. I admit that when a Bill has been carefully considered by the other Chamber in the way this has been, many of the objectionable features which did exist are either removed or modified, and that, therefore, this Chamber may have no need to go into the provisions so fully as it would if the measure were before them in its original form. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill is one of very great importance. At the same time it is one which ought to be dealt with in committee rather than in long second-reading speeches.; and I propose to make only a few cursory remarks. I cannot help observing that, during his introductory speech, the Vice-President of the Executive Council was silent on the matter which formed the greatest of all the topics of discussion in the other Chamber, namely, how or by what means the uniform Tariff was to be brought in, coincidentally or not coincidentally with the introduction of InterState free-trade. </para>

His reply is an instruction to the Senate as to the position it should assume with regard to this Bill, and is some enlightenment to the Senate in regard to its duty as to the very drastic powers which the Government ask Parliament to bestow upon them.

                        <para>- It is quite evident that we are all deliberately trying to shorten the discussion, on the second reading of this Bill. With that object, I am inclined personally to fall in. At the same time, I should like chiefly because of remarks which have fallen from the Vice-President of the Executive Council - to say a few words with regard to the more important matters dealt with in the Bill. First' of all, with regard to the question of ships' stores. We have been told by the Vice-President, in a very airy sort of way, if he will permit me to say so without offence, that there will be no difficulty in enforcing the provisions of this Bill in regard to' ships' stores. If I remember- rightly, the honorable and learned senator said there would be no trouble in the application of the clauses of this Bill to foreign ships, because we could proceed against the captain of a foreign ship, where he had broken seal. The honorable and learned senator induced us to believe that the ships' stores will be sealed up on arriving at one port of the Commonwealth to go to the next, and where on arrival at the next port it is found that the seal has been broken, proceedings can be taken under this Bill, and the penalty inflicted. The honorable and learned senator may be able to find a provision in this Bill for imposing such a penalty, but I have been unable, since he spoke, to find it. I should like, before I go further, if it can be done, to have the provision indicated to me. </para>

                            <para>- If the provision is there, I am glad to find it is so. But, in any case, I &lt;*im sure that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is too well versed in law not to know the difficulty there is in dealing with these foreign ships, and that it is a difficulty that cannot be got over in this Bill. Another difficulty has occurred to me which the Vice-President of the Executive Council may be able to see his way out of, and that is the difficulty of dealing with British ships. Section 5 of the Constitution, as the honorable and learned senator knows, says that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships - the Queen's ships of war excepted - whose first port of clearance, and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. I am unable to see how it can be contended that the first port of clearance of a P. and 0. or Orient boat is any port in the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is quite possible that such an interference as is proposed, as in the case of a ship registered in Great Britain and whose first pal t of clearance is in Great Britain, may be found to seriously imperil the assent to the Bill. I know that reliance was placed upon the powers given under the Constitution, and an endeavour was made to twist the words " first port of clearance," so as to cover the operation of the clauses of this Bill. That attempt, I see, is abandoned, and there is now no reliance upon the Constitution for enforcing the provisions of the Bill against British ships. </para>

Surely I shall be in order in pointing out how this Bill might be amended in a direction which would be of more importance to the Commonwealth than probably any other matter winch we could consider at present. By providing for the imposition of uniform duties so as to secure Inter-State free-trade at once. You, sir, will not rule me out of order if I suggest that such a thing might have been done in the Bill, and I shall be allowed to point out that in my opinion it is a blemish on this Bill that such a provision was not made in it. The Vice-President of the Executive Council knows my opinions on the subject of free-trade and protection, and yet as a whole-hearted free-trader I tell him that I should have welcomed in this Bill - </para>

If they were, any subject matter might be debated concerning any Bill : because a senator might get up and say - " I think this amendment ought to have been inserted in the Bill," and then go on to argue as to whether these clauses were proper clauses or not. So that we might have the whole question of free-trade and protection discussed under this Bill; we might have the question of Inter-State free-trade discussed under it ; and we might have 50 other questions discussed under it with which the subject-matter of this Bill has nothing at all to do. I point out to honorable senators generally that this is a machinery Bill. So far as I can understand, no questions of policy arc embodied in the Bill, and we ought not on every possible occasion to discuss and re-discuss matters which have already been disposed of or will come on for discussion by-and-by. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I understood the honorable and learned senator raised another question altogether, as to whether this Bill ought to provide for the time at which Inter-State free-trade should come into existence. I think the Bill ought not to provide for that, and could not be amended to provide for it. </para>

These clauses are intended to provide for immunity from legal proceedings in respect to the collection of duties to be provided for, and I shall propose an amendment to secure constitutionally the remission of duties, so as to provide for Inter-State free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that you, sir, have ruled that in clause 217, as referring to the collection of duties, I am not out of order, because I think an amendment may be made to it which will be of very great importance to the whole of the Commonwealth. If this clause is made to apply to the collection of uniform duties, Inter - State free - trade must necessarily, under the Constitution, immediately begin. We cannot consider clause 217 in any other way than by anticipating what its operation will be, and what class of duties will be collected under it ; and it is a fair question to ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council what duties are to be collected under it. Surely that arises out of the discussion of the clause? </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly I recognise that it applies to the collection of duties which we may now impose, and for all time until it is repealed ; but the fact remains that it will operate immediately the Tariff is laid upon the table in another place, and surely it is a fair thing to discuss' the mode of its operation and the manner of its incidence. The Vice-President of the Executive Council knows that there is no question which so largely affects the whole Commonwealth at the present time, and I say that I should have preferred, if it were possible, to see in this Bill some provision by which the Tariff would have been imposed, and would operate for a definite time, say for this session. If I am in order in discussing that, I tell the Vice-President of the Executive Council that, free-trader as I am, I should have welcomed such a provision in this Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I hope with all' respect that I am not trespassing further than I ought. I am sure you will recognise that this clause 217 is a clause inserted in this Bill to deal with the collection of duties under the Tariff. Surely under those circumstances it is competent for me to suggest some other method by which the Tariff might be collected. And surely it is competent for me to suggest that all this bother might have been got rid of if there had been in the Bill some provision for collecting one Tariff only - a Tariff imposed specifically at a certain time, and to begin at a certain time. If there had been some provision of that sort my contention is that these clauses would have been unnecessary. My contention further is that such a provision would be most desirable, lt would secure many objects which, in deference to you, sir, I shall refrain from mentioning, I feel you have given me an indulgence which you have doubts about my deserving, and therefore I refrain from going into any details. I have succeeded in my attempt to indicate to the Government that, in my opinion, clauses 213 to 2IS are not satisfactory, might very considerably have been improved, and, if they, had been improved upon in the direction I have indicated, would have been productive of more good than we can do by any measure until th Tariff is finally imposed. </para>

                    <para>- I do not rise to propose an amendment, but to call attention to the fact that this clause requires that penalties shall be incurred on conviction. Under clause 229 in some of these cases it might be a penalty of only 10s. or £1. Surely it is not intended in every case to drag an importer before even a police court over some trivial error or oversight. That certainly has not been the practice in Victoria all these years. It is bad enough to have the discredit of being fined for the commission of an error, but it is really too bad to have the disgrace of being brought before a police court, and convicted of an offence against the Customs Act, when the conviction is not needed to protect the revenue. </para>

                    <para>. - If my honorable friend will refer to clause 256 he will see that it provides for the settlement of a dispute between an officer and any person by the Minister, whom it empowers to impose any penalty or forfeiture which he shall determine shall have been incurred. My honorable friend no doubt prefers the practice with which he is well acquainted in regard to minor infringements of the Customs Act. If the Minister deals with the dispute, then, under clause 256, he imposes a fine ; but if the party does not consent to the intervention of the Minister, surely there is no hardship in the matter being brought before the court in the ordinary way. We cannot . constitute the Minister a court, and he cannot decide in the absence of consent. I think my honorable friend, will see. . that clause 256 really gives all the power which is necessary to deal with small matters. In fact, it is the kind of clause under which the practice he referred to is carried out. I suppose that in the vast majority of cases the Minister does deal with small matters. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to be unreasonable, but at the same time I think the honorable senator is asking too much when he suggests the postponement of a clause like this, which is obviously necessary and usual, and against the retention of which he cannot give a single reason. If the honorable senator does find any serious reason why the clause should not be passed, he might raise the point on recommittal. </para>

                        <para>- That may have been a fault in administration. It seems rather hard to not only require shed accommodation, but to attach a penalty of £20 for not providing it. The amendment might impose a very heavy burden on wharf-owners, because it would leave it open to the Customs authorities to insist on shed accommodation being placed on every wharf. It ought to be left to the Minister to grant a licence, which would not be granted unless he was satisfied there was proper accommodation. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the committee will not assent to this amendment. It is recognised that the observance of these provisions should be enforced by some kind of penalty which people will feel when it is imposed. The officer employed on the wharf is the person who has to control and inspect everything that goes on in regard to customs matters. Surely there should be a serious penalty imposed where proper accommodation is not provided. The minimum penalty for any offence is to be one-twentieth of the penalty mentioned in the clause. The minimum in this case will be £1 . Surely it may be left to the Minister to discriminate as to what fine is merited by the offence. The case may be merely one of omission, where a small fine will be sufficient, but it may be a serious offence where a man is setting the authorities at defiance and preventing the Act being carried into operation. </para>

                        <para>- I point out that the suggested amendment is not necessary. The word " collector " includes the comptroller and any collector of Customs for the State, and any principle officer of Customs doing duty at the time and place, and any officer doing duty in the matter in relation to which the expression is used. I take it that the collector under the clause is the person absolutely in charge at the time the fraud or misconduct takes place, and as a general rule it will be some principal officer who will be in charge. Unless this power is given for the immediate revocation of a licence, misconduct may take place on the part of a licensee at some port remote from the head office, and we ought not to run the risk of smuggling taking place, or of any of the evils against which all this machinery is directed. The Collector of Customs would see that proper officers were appointed to carry out these duties. It really comes back to this, that action cannot be taken on the spot. I do not think it would be sufficient to delegate the power to every officer, because there is a limitation in clauses 9 and 10. </para>

There is no doubt that in the ordinary working of the department a general delegation will be given to some principal officer in each place. During the adjournment for dinner, I found that there would be no harm in the amendment, and perhaps it may facilitate the carrying on of the department. I move - </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that any one who knows anything about Customs business will say it is a small offence. The only control we have over the carriage of goods is that they are to be taken in carriages, boats, or lighters that are licensed. If a person is allowed to take away goods on the chance of having to pay a small penalty if detected, he may make it a very lucrative business. Any one who knows the working of Customs Acts will admit that it is a very serious matter, and £20 is not excessive for a maximum penalty. </para>

                    <para>- It is not the individual but the carriage or the lighter that is licensed. Supposing that a man's licensed vehicle gets out of order and he has to use another vehicle for the purpose of carrying goods on a special occasion, then £20 is a severe penalty to impose. If it applied to the case of an unlicensed person carrying goods it would be a different thing. </para>

                        <para>- It is the carriage that is licensed, and any one can see whether it is licensed. That aids the officials in their work of seeing that the Act is carried out. If any person may use an unlicensed carriage it is obvious that we at once open the door to a great deal of illicit dealing, and unless we make the penalty a large one it may be worth a person's while to take the risk. </para>

No doubt the Customs, officials will always endeavour to meet the convenience of the ship, but the collector must be the judge of the circumstances. If there is an agreement there will be no trouble, because the collector can allow overtime ; but inasmuch as the whole matter at issue is the collection of revenue, it is right . that the fixing of the hours should be in the hands of the Customs officials. </para>

                    <para>- The clause is undoubtedly the existing law in Victoria, and it has been administered very liberally, the convenience. of the ships being studied- rather than the convenience of the Customs-house officials. Lately, however; there has been a change, and during the last month or two I have known a. case in which) permission to discharge cargo from a large ship on a holiday was refused. The present Minister of Customs was appealed to, but he backed up the officers, and the ship had to remain idle, although there would have been no difficulty in getting labour: at an increasedpay. </para>

                    <para>- I. support the request that the clause be postponed. On referring to the interpretation clause I see that the word " collector " includes a considerable number of Customs officials, any one of whom might materially interfere with the working of large vessels, involving demurrage charges, and much loss. So far as my experience of the port of Sydney is concerned I do not think the men engaged in the discharge of ships object to working overtime, seeing that they are handsomely paid for it? It is unreasonable that any one of at considerable number, of officials should have it in his power, apparently without any appeal, 'to stop and harass a ship-master who may per haps have made himself a little unpopular by some small outbreak of temper. </para>

                    <para>- At the present time in several States goods which come through the Post-office are not subject to customs entries. The addressee receives the goods at the Post-office by paying the customs duty without having to pass a customs entry. At the Post-office in Tasmania, and, I believe, at the Post-office in South Australia it is possible to receive dutiable goods by applying there and paying the amount of duty, which is there and then assessed. That, I take . it, is the practice which we want to obtain in the Commonwealth. I believe that we discussed this question on a clause of the Post and Telegraph Bill. </para>

                    <para>- To my knowledge for 30 years this practice has been carried out without the slightest difficulty. It does not say that all. the forms of entry are to be gone through, but that these goods shall be under the control of the Customs equally with other goods. We do not want the control to be either less or more than it is on other goods. If it would meet the views of honorable senators we might put in the words " as prescribed," but it would make no difference. The detail of carrying out this control is simplicity itself .It is a matter of everyday occurrence. No entries are needed. A printed form is simply sent to the addressee, with a notification, . and if he does not care to go up to the Post-office, he can ask the Customs officer to value the article, and thereupon he receives a note that the duty is so much, and he pays the duty. It is much more simple than 'having to pass an entry through the Customs. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment would result in decreasing very largely the convenience which now obtains in dealing with dutiable goods through the Post-office. At present there is no difficulty, but if the amendment were passed, whenever goods over £5-in value came through the Post an entry would have to be made, seeing that the limit must have some binding effect on the officials. The discretion now exercised would be taken away. </para>

                    <para>- It would be very little more trouble to pass an entry than to prove that goods were under £5 in value. A declaration of some kind would have to be made, and the only difference that I see lies, perhaps, in the payment of a small fee of 2s. 6d. for making an entry. That difficulty might, however, be met by providing that in the case of small imports through the Post no fee should be charged. </para>

It appears to me that if the collector does not do certain things he may find himself liable for that amount, although the whole scope of the Bill is to make " the other fellow " pay. </para>

I cannot conceive of any person who understands English misunderstanding the meaning of these words. A large number of words might have been used to convey the meaning, but it is quite clear already what the meaning is, and I do .not think the committee should be troubled seriously with this kind of criticism. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the committee -will not accept the amendment, because the word is required to cover a distinct class' of cases. The goods are entered and unshipped. That means taken' out of the ship. If they are put into a lighter they are not landed.; they are put over the side of the ship. If the goods are put from a ship on to a wharf, it may be that the taking of them out of the ship is landing them, but they may be unshipped and put into a lighter and taken a considerable distance and landed at another wharf or direct into another ship. They would be unshipped, landed, and examined. No penalty is imposed by the clause. It only indicates the steps which are to be taken. The word "landed" is quite as necessary as the word " unshipped." </para>

                    <para>- Supposing a man had a pass, it could be produced and would be a satisfactory accounting for the absence of a certificate. But the certificate or the pass might by some mischance get destroyed after the vessel sailed, and when the captain reached this port, he would be in this fix that he could not land any of his goods. He might explain how the certificate got destroyed. It is far more satisfactory to allow the clause to stand as it is, and to leave it to the Customs authorities to be satisfied that the absence of the certificate was satisfactorily accounted for. </para>

                        <para>- In the Tasmanian and Western Australian Acts there is a similar provision and, I believe, in other State Acts also. </para>

                        <para>- Whether there be a similar provision in other State laws or not, I contend that it is undesirable to place this power in the hands of any Government. To prohibit the importation of any particular article is a serious step that ought to be taken by the Legislature and not simply by Ministers. These proclamations may be made at any time and under any circumstances, and it is not a safe power to give an Executive, especially as it may be exercised when Parliament is not sitting. I have a very strong opinion that it is undesirable to allow the Executive to do any legislative work, such as this practically is, seeing that they are left free to prohibit the importation of any particular article they may see fit. If an import matter crops up during recess, surely it could wait the ordinary course, like other matters, until Parliament meets. </para>
