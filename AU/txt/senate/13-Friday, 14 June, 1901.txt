                        <para>- There are other senators who are under that impression. Therefore, of course, I arn free to admit that a misunderstanding may have arisen. Under such circumstances it seems to me the proper course is to have such a misunderstanding cleared up at the earliest possible moment. Therefore, the question I intend to put to you, sir, is, whether you understood me to say - " I accept the ruling," or - " I except to the ruling " ? Of course if you also understood, as I am sure must have been the case, that I said "accept" 1 can understand what took place. If you had understood me as saying " I except to your ruling," the question would not have been put in the way it was put. The amendment would not have been dropped while an exception to your ruling was in existence. I think the Senate will agree with me that I am taking the readiest and most decorous method of setting right a misunderstanding which has arisen, by asking whether you understood me to say " I accept " or " I except." </para>

                        <para>- I most undoubtedly understood the honorable and learned senator to say, "I accept your ruling." I am fortified in that opinion, because, if the honorable and learned senator had said " I except to your ruling," lie ought to ha ve submitted a motion .disagreeing with the ruling. All rulings of the President stand unless the Senate itself disagrees with them. Therefore, I could come to no other conclusion ; in fact, I never was for a moment in doubt as to what the honorable and learned senator said. </para>

I have gone very carefully into the matter since, and have had a consultation with my colleagues, and I desire to inform the Senate as to the course I propose to adopt. I hope that course will meet with the approval of honorable senators who have spoken on the subject. I propose that when order of the day No. 1 is called on - that is, the order of the day for the suspension of the standing orders - to move that the order be discharged, and on the order of the day No. 2 - the second reading of the Supply Bill - being moved I propose to consent to an amendment, to the effect - </para>

                    <para>. - I have no objection to this motion myself, and I am prepared to second it. Personally, I am entirely in favour of opening our proceedings with prayer. I am not speaking now from a religious point of view - not that I desire it to be understood that I regard that point of view with anything but the greatest respect, but there may be others better qualified than myself to speak on that aspect of the subject. I have been accustomed, in the State from which I come, to see the proceedings of the Legislative Council opened with prayer, consisting of two collects and the Lord's Prayer. I am inclined to think that a few moments spent in that way make a break in the business of the day, and perhaps induce an attitude of mind on the part of members of the Legislature that is favourable to the despatch of the business which they have to perform. I think, therefore, that on that ground alone, if for no other reason, it is desirable that our proceedings shall be opened in that way. I am happy to support and to second the motion. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure honorable members will give the senator who has just resumed his seat full credit for the view's he entertains, and although he appears 'to be in opposition the present proposal, still we do not fail recognise that he has stated his fullest belief in religion where properly observed. But let me point out to him that this is not an occasion on which we are merely to say that we are instructed that religion is to be observed only in the closet ; that a ian is to confine his religious observances simply to his own chamber. That, no doubt, is the proper place for a man to observe many of these principles. At the same time, are we not told that it is well for men when they meet together to recognise the divine authority ? According to. the argument put before the Senate just now, our churches should be closed ; there should be no observance of religion in the churches of our land. </para>

I certainly commend the motion strongly to honorable senators, and I am perfectly sure that they will practically be of one mind, and accept it as a proper principle to lay down in connexion with legislation by means of which we hope to promote the prosperity of the great community of which we are endeavouring to lay the frame-work. </para>

                        <para>- Or hypocrisy. trust that every honorable senator has the utmost contempt for anything of the kind. At the same time I trust that we, as a representative body, may at least acknowledge the Almighty in our doings, that we may at least follow the precedent which has been well established in other communities. The Commonwealth Act itself is framed with a humble reliance upon Divine Providence. Moreover, the Parliament of another great Dominion or Commonwealth has by each of its Chambers adopted a resolution of the kind. And the other House of this Parliament has seen fit almost unanimously to do the same. Apart altogether from the religious aspect of the matter, which is an exceedingly important one, I think, as a public body, we are called upon to make this acknowledgment and to ask for guidance in our deliberations. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would have been far better if the honorable senator had moved the motion without making that reflection on the youth of Australia. I do not think it can be said that the young people of Australia are any less reverent than the young people of any other portion of the British dominions. Possibly the abuse which has been made of religion is the cause of a good deal of the want of reverence in Australian youth. It is the uses to which religion has been put which have caused a good deal of this want of reverence, and I certainly disagree that this provision is needed in order to inculcate a feeling of reverence in the Australian youth. What is -needed, I think, is a better use of the religious forms and observances that they have in other places. </para>

                            <para>- No, I do not want to give names. The gentleman who was appointed has passed away: He was not bound to take it, but we should place it beyond the power of any Ministry or any leader of a Ministry to put temptation in the way of a Member of Parliament. I think it would be a calamity if some of the gentlemen who now occupy positions in this Federal Parliament were to accept positions that might be offered to them by-and-by by the Federal Ministry. </para>

                            <para>- We did not qualify our statement in that way. We were all very careful to inform the electors that it was our desire to serve the country, in endeavouring to so shape its laws that they would be for the peace, order, and good government of the community. If any member, of the Senate or of the House of Representatives had such a poor opinion of the position that he made the mental reservation that, if he got a chance, he would abandon it, and get away into a comfortable and lucrative position, I think we should do all in our power to put a stop to that kind of thing. I think we can do it by passing a resolution of this kind. I hold strongly the view, more especially with regard to the Judges, that no member of the legal profession who enters into the hurlyburly of politics should become a Judge. </para>

                            <para>- I would like to add a few words to what has already been said. I recognise, as every honorable member recognises, that there is a strong feeling amongst a large section of the community on the question of Members of Parliament obtaining appointments from Governments of the day. I am also aware that in certain cases abuses have arisen in consequence of that practice. But ' it appears to me that we should be concerned, not only for the interests of individual members, but as to what is best in the interests of the community as a whole. To my mind it appears to be a distinct disadvantage to a community to place a bar against the admission of, perhaps, the very best men in the community to the legislative halls. </para>

At the same time, we find people recognising the fact that the best men they can geb to represent them are men belonging to the legal profession ; and it would be a distinct disadvantage to the State and the Commonwealth to say that when a man is sent to the Legislature because of his eminent qualifications, he shall not be .available to the Government for an appointment to the Bench. </para>

I distinctly dissent from the principle that because a man, by the voice of the people of the country, obtains a seat in the Legislature, he should be debarred from appointment to a position, although he may be eminently fitted for it. I do not oppose the motion as one on which there is nothing to be said on the other side, because I recognise there is a great deal to be said. It expresses an opinion honestly held by a large section of the community ; but, at the same time, my opinion is that the balance of advantages is in favour of dealing with the matter not in this particular way, but by leaving it entirely open,' while letting the Government understand that any appointments they make will be looked into most closely and criticised severely if any corrupt motives are found. That, I say, is the way' in which the interests of the public could be most carefully safeguarded and protected. </para>

                            <para>- There is a great deal to be said in favour of the principle proposed in this motion. Those who have paid any attention to practical politics in the various States during the past 30 years, must recollect not a few cases in which, had there been such a law in existence as is now proposed, some political scandals would have been avoided. In Victoria a law of this kind has been in existence since the foundation of the Constitution, and, so far as I am aware, it has worked satisfactorily. If it be the desire that a certain member of either House should be selected for a certain position as being the most capable man, it is not a difficult matter for him to resign his seat, and, as provided in Victoria, wait for six months before the appointment is made. But I venture to think - even if I entirely agreed with the principle - that this motion is inopportune, because our position now" is very different from what it will be when once the Commonwealth ship is fairly launched and fully manned. There are a number of important positions that must be filled, and filled promptly, if the Commonwealth machinery is to be carried on satisfactorily, and therefore for Parliament to pass a law of this nature during the next twelve months would, to my mind, be very inadvisable. During that time we shall need to select the most suitable men, whether they be inside or outside of Parliament, for a number of important positions. I think it is very undesirable that the Commonwealth should in any way restrict the choice of men in the present circumstances. I would also point out that this, after all, is merely a resolution of one branch of the Legislature. It is merely an expression of opinion on the part of this House. But if this House, or a large section of it, thinks that it is desirable that such a course should be adopted, the proper plan to follow is to introduce a Bill, to pass it through this House, and send it on to another place to be dealt with. Simply to pass a resolution is like beating the wind, lt can have no effect. It appears to me that it would be very much better for those who think that this is desirable legislation to introduce a Bill and let this House deal, with it and send it on to the other Chamber. Personally, I should oppose such a Bill at the present time, as 1 shall oppose this motion, for the reason that during the next six or eight months we must select the best men we can get to thoroughly man our State ship. </para>

                            <para>- There seems to be an erroneous idea that this motion is directed at the lawyers, with the object of preventing them from gaining any benefit from their profession or practice. I think that it is rather1 aimed at preventing undue practices in connexion with the appointment of lawyers to high positions. They can continue their work as lawyers even if this motion is carried. I do not think this is a motion that any one can object to, seeing that we have carried, this morning, a resolution asking the Almighty to keep ns out of temptation. This motion has the same purpose in view. We wish to keep the able lawyer who comes into Parliament from the temptation that we are going to ask the Almighty every day that we meet here, to keep us all from. This is only fit and proper. The dignity of the Chamber has been very much talked of since Parliament opened. If we carry a motion of this kind we shall raise the* dignity of the Chamber much higher than by reciting a lot of prayers. We shall show some earnestness- at least. If we have a very able man in the Federal Parliament,, instead of offering him inducements to leave it, we should do everything we can to retain him. This, motion is a step in the right direction. We desire to retain the great abilities of these men in Parliament, and to allow lawyers outside who wish to make the legal profession their study, to fill whatever billets may be vacant. Therefore, I am altogether in. favour of the motion, and will support it. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to support this motion, and I consider that it is a very necessary one, and should be adopted by this Chamber in the interests of political morality. I find that every senator who has addressed himself to the subject approves of the spirit of the resolution. We all agree that there is a feeling outside that politicians are placed in a position of: undue preference with regard to certain public appointments, and therefore it is necessary to do something to limit the excess of opportunities which they possess. But when we come down -with a concrete proposal, some senators are against it. Now, if there is an evil, should not honorable senators proceed at once to apply the remedy? </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that we can begin too soon to apply a remedy in a matter of 'this kind. Some senators have concluded that this motion is aimed specially at the legal profession, but it is not intended to deal with that profession any more than with other professions. The legal profession will necessarily be involved, and perhaps more than any other profession. For some reason or other - I have not been able to ' fathom it yet - we find far more lawyers coming into Parliament than members of any other profession. It pays an engineer far better not to enter upon the field of politics. A medical man rarely goes into politics, and if he does, no patient will consult him about the state of his health, because all recognise that no man can serve two masters. A man cannot be an active political student and an explorer in the region of medical science. If I want advice upon any question 1 go to a specialist-to the man who devotes his entire time and energy to that special subject. If I want the advice of a physician I do not go to a quasi-politican, but to a man who devotes himself entirely to the study of his profession. If I wanted the advice of a lawyer I should not go to the political lawyer, because I know that those gentlemen, however great may be the opportunities which present themselves, are rarely good lawyers. I think that what I have said must appeal to every honorable senator. We are all men of the world. We know what is what as well as our neighbours do. I have- no doubt that the honorable senator who introduced this motion did so with a view to preventing certain members of the legal profession in Parliament from being exalted to judgeships of the Commonwealth. </para>

                                <para>- He introduced this motion with a view to preventing that. The Postmaster-General said that in doing so an attempt was being made to. place a stigma on Members of Parliament. What is attempted to be done in this motion is to place Members of Parliament outside the region of suspicion. We will not allow any Member of Parliament to be a Government contractor. If a Member of Parliament supplies goods to the Government he is committing an offence - he loses his seat, and is subjected to a penalty. If an honorable senator resigns his position to-day and becomes a large Government contractor to-morrow, the public immediately conclude that political influence has been brought to bear, and that corruption is at the root of it. </para>

                                <para>- I am quite aware of that. I am merely citing the case as an illustration. We do not permit that sort of thing with Members of Parliament. But when we come down to the specially privileged individuals who wear horse-hair wigs and cloaks, and who 'form one of the closest unions under God's sky, there are exemptions in regard to them. They can hold any number of offices under the Crown: A man may be 'an Attorney-General for the Government and he may take a brief against the Government. </para>

                                <para>- They are very much plural. We know that if this motion is passed the result may be to prevent some very honorable and distinguished individuals from securing certain positions under the Crown. Not only is it assumed that these gentlemen are honorable and distinguished, but it is also assumed that they are very competent. I think honorable senators will have gathered from what I have said that I do not believe in the competence of the political lawyer. One honorable senator interjected that in Great Britain the Judges are all drawn from the ranks of the politicians. I know that perfectly well ; but that is only one of a thousand abuses which exist in Great Britain. How is it possible for a man to become an expert lawyer if he devotes all his time to politics - and we know what politics are, especially in the higher ranks? How can a man succeed in his profession when he devotes all his time to intrigue and to subterfuge ? </para>

                                <para>- Set a man on a hill, and immediately he becomes eminent - the cynosure of every beholder ; but there may be very little greatness in the man himself. Suppose you want a Chief Justice, and there is a very active lawyer-politician in this Chamber. He is in opposition to the Government ; he is a splendid politician and an able debater - a sharp thorn in their side. What do the Government say? "We shall remove this chap ; we shall shift him to some more serene atmosphere ; we shall extract this thorn - we shall place him on the bench." That has been done, not only once, but a dozen times, and will be done again unless some motion of this character is passed. The Government might also have a supporter whom they desired to reward, and he would be placed on the bench as his reward, while a great number of well-trained and capable lawyers outside, who never came into the arena of politics, would be entirely passed over. We find that the position of Attorney-General in many cases - in most cases, indeed - is given to a man, not for his eminence in law, but for his eminence in politics.Why, sir, a third-rate lawyer, a man who the members of the bar will tell you is a very poor lawyer, may come into Parliament and be an excellent politician. </para>

                                <para>- I believe there are some poor lawyers. I believe that some men who know a great deal of law are poor simply because they are deficient in some of the qualities which command success at the bar. A third-rate lawyer, if he is a good politician, is usually elevated to the position of Attorney-General, and we know that from that position to the Bench is only a step. We had a flagrant instance of that sort of thing in Queensland, and that perhaps makes me all the more decided as to giving my support to this motion. In Queensland we had a gentleman who not only appointed himself to the position of Chief Justice, 'but also so arranged matters that he got £1,000 a year added to his salary. All this was done because of his political power. </para>

                                <para>- Of course I quite understand the honorable and learned senator's reasons. There is no need that I should go into them. Some one has asked why should we be prohibited from appointing a Member of Parliament to a position on the Inter-State Commission. It is just for the very same reason that we should not appoint lawyers from the Senate to judgeships - because the whole thing has a look of political corruption about it. A strong opponent of the Government might be got rid of in this way, or a faithful adherent might be rewarded, and I say that it is absolutely necessary that we should hold ourselves above any suspicion of that character. I know that in one State at any rate a prominent politician has been angling for a position on the Inter-State Commission for some time, and it seems likely that he will get it. His capacity for the position has never been taken into consideration at all. The considerations that have weighed, and are weighing, with the people who will have the recommending of this particular individual are these: - "If so-and-so is appointed to the Inter-State Commission, I get his billet." That is one man's consideration. Another man's consideration is that "if so-and-so gets so-and-so's billet, I will get his billet, because there will be a general move up all round," and the public interest is never considered at all. There are a great many other reasons why this motion should be passed thoroughly. I do not intend to occupy the time of the Senate at any greater length. I trust that we shall, so to speak, place ourselves beyond suspicion. Whatever action we take, we should take it in such a way that there will not be the suspicion haunting the public mind that men are appointed to high positions simply for political reasons. </para>

                                <para>- It was stated by the last speaker that the motion was aimed at no one in particular, but as he proceeded he displayed the cloven hoof, and showed that the real object of the motion was to prevent lawyers who were in Parliament from being appointed to judgeships. It seems to me that the principle underlying the motion is such as we are accustomed to describe as the dog-in-manger principle. Perhaps some of these gentlemen are incapable, and therefore unlikely to receive any of these high offices, and therefore they are anxious that others shall not have an opportunity to get that for which they themselves are unfit. It seems to me that this motion casts a most unjustifiable and unnecessary stigma upon Ministers of the Crown. It implies that they would take advantage of their position to give a judgeship or some other prominent appointment to a gentleman who was unfit for it, simply because of his association with them and the friendship that it engendered, or in order to get rid of a troublesome opponent. I think the Government have so far done nothing to justify us in passing a resolution which undoubtedly in the public mind would carry an unfavorable impression -to them. The motion would undoubtedly convey to the readers of this debate the belief that the Senate has no respect whatsoever for the honest judgment of our Ministers. I would like to say one word in answer to my friend as regards lawyers. I have been brought up in the old country, where I think our bench favorably compares with the bench in any part of the world, and I have scarcely ever seen a lawyer elevated to the bench who did not go through a training in Parliament. My friend asks - how does it fit a man for the bench that . he should enter the political arena? My answer is this: What more fitting preparation can you give to those who have the explanation of the laws than to give them some training in the making of the laws? It is the duty of the Judge to interpret ; it is the duty of the Legislature to construct. And we find in all analogous proceeding that the man who has gone through all the education of forming the machine or drawing the document is more conversant with all the details that will enable him to thoroughly explain and interpret. </para>

                                <para>- That is not the duty of the lawyer. It may be the practice of the lawyer to bamboozle his hearers, not because of the dishonesty of the lawyer, but because of the entangled mentality of some of his hearers. My honorable friend has said that the advocate is the person least capable of becoming a good judge, but I would point out that the faculty which makes a good advocate is the capacity of being able to see all the features of a case in the most telling light. Good advocates possess largely the analytical power which makes the mind receptive of all impressions. When a man of that character sits on the bench,- without a bias in favour of one side or the other, his mind is more prone to accept the features which are put more forcibly, and those usually are the correct features. Accordingly it has been found, although there are some notable exceptions, that the lawyer who has proved himself eminent at the bar has proved himself equally eminent on the bench. It is not because a thing is capable of being abused that therefore it has not its use. There is no doubt that the power to appoint a Judge from amongst the members of a Legislature is capable of abuse, but that would be a very poor reason indeed to induce us to rob our bench of every man who had proved himself to be a shining light in the Legislature. It seems to me that the effect of this motion would be that every man who felt from his capacities, his education, and his experience, that he was fitted to occupy some of the prominent positions in the State, would never enter Parliament, because this motion would say to him - " By entering Parliament you incapacitate yourself from reaching any of those positions." </para>

                                <para>- Is it the desire of any of those honorable senators, who are never tired of telling us - and I quite agree with them - that Parliament should be open to the best talent of the country, that a motion should be carried which unquestionably would have the effect of restraining the ablest men from entering the arena because it would incapacitate them from accepting any of those high positions which ought to be the laudable ambition of every man of capacity? My honorable friend has said that the fact that there are many lawyers who, when they get on the bench, prove themselves to be eminent is in itself no evidence that these are good men, because any one put in an exalted position thereby becomes eminent. Even a fool may be exalted to an eminent position, but his eminence may serve only to exalt his folly. What Tennyson terms - </para>

If we pass the motion, how will the choice of Parliament be limited ? We shall still be able to choose from some hundreds of members of the legal profession: the choice will not be limited to any extent,and so far as the Inter-State Commission is concerned, I think we shall have a still wider choice outside the two Houses than we would have, if the resolution were defeated. </para>

                            <para>- This question was fully debated during the sittings of the Convention at Adelaide, and I took some part in it. It was proposed that members should be disallowed to take these positions, and after considerable discussion the Convention thought it wise that the matter should stand as it is placed now. I think that after mature consideration it will be found best to allow matters to remain as they are. It throws a stigma on a Member of Parliament to say that he shall not be allowed to take an office if he is otherwise eligible. Other things being equal, I think he should be allowed to participate in any benefits that may arise from the fact that there are appointments to be filled just as any ordinary member of the public is eligible. I therefore support the existing system. </para>

                                <para>- There is very great danger when a Ministry are struggling for existence; when they find a strong opponent in the leader of the Opposition, perhaps, and consider that the only way in which they can be saved and their salaries secured is to get rid of him - to get rid of him by elevating him to the bench. These remarks apply equally to supporters of the Ministry. It is thought that those who have supported a Ministry through thick and thin should to a certain extent be given appointments, and that the spoils should go to the victors. That danger is recognised in the public service ; under the old system there have been some of the greatest disputes in Parliament on account of preferences alleged to have been given. </para>

                <para>This motion is practically on all fours with one that was recently carried in respect to the elections for the Senate in Tasmania. That there will be no difficulty in the production of the return I can easily satisfy the Postmaster-General by producing the official return of the State signed by the returning officer for New South Wales. There is only one exception. This return gives the number of informal votes at 38,674. That is not the number of the informal votes, but the number of the informal voting papers, and as each paper should represent six votes, plumping being prohibited, the total number of informal votes in New South Wales nearly approaches a quarter of a million. When the 38,674 voting papers are multiplied by the number of the votes it shows what an extraordinary number of informal votes there were. </para>

                    <para>- To a motion of this kind I have very little objection ; but I object to honorable senators going into the country and making statements with respect to other people, and then coming here and publishing their own greatness. What has been the object in moving for this return ? Has it been for the purpose of showing that the honorable senator would have been at the bottom or at the top of the poll, if the intelligence of either the Parliament of New South Wales or its people had been exercised to a greater extent ? I do not think that the honorable senator who is prepared when another honorable senator wants to make an explanation to get up and object himself, should expect us for one moment to allow him to do just as he likes. </para>

                    <para>. - When progress was reported last night I was discussing the method to be adopted for fixing rates of postage. I would repeat the observation I made then, that in speaking of this Bill I should like to be regarded not exactly as an advocate for any of its provisions. I have arrived at a decision in every case after balancing the advantages and disadvantages. The advocate as a rule who desires to achieve success presents only the advantages of his own case and says nothing of the disadvantages. I do not want to do that. I believe that in some cases I could state the arguments against some of the provisions in the Bill almost more strongly than they have been stated by any senator yet, and still I think that the advantages of the course that is suggested in the Bill outweigh the disadvantages. There is a feeling in the' minds of a number of honorable senators that the power of fixing rates should reside in the Parliament ; that Parliament should fix the rates, and that having been fixed they should remain in force for some time. </para>

                        <para>- They cannot be altered. I am supposing that the rates are fixed as they have been in the Postal Acts of Victoria and Queensland. I am not certain about some of the other States. In that . event they cannot be filtered except by Parliament. Just on the eve of federation a Postal Bill was brought forward in Victoria to' reduce the rates of postage within the State from 2d. to Id. It was brought forward for the express purpose of enabling the lower rate to be adopted immediately after federation, and it came into force on the 1st April. That was a case where the rate was fixed by Act of Parliament, and a Bill had to be brought in to reduce it. Supposing that plan is adopted here, then within six months from this time, or say within twelve months, there will be a deputation waiting on the Postmaster-General, and asking him to reduce the rates of postage on some particular kind of publication or postal matter. </para>

                        <para>- I would not like to commit myself to an absolute expression of opinion on the point, because it is expressly declared that during the bookkeeping period the revenue from any State is to be credited to that State, and the expenditure of that State is to be debited to it. The Constitution Act does not say that we shall not make such changes as may affect the revenue and expenditure. I do not think we would violate the Constitution if by law we provided for a reduction of rates which would mean a loss of revenue ; but I have very strong doubts whether it would be wise to do anything that would unfairly interfere with the revenue of the States at the present time. If honorable senators agree with me on the point that, if we are to fix the rates by schedule in this Bill, we ought to fix them so as to be uniform, I want to say that it is undesirable that we should equalize rates at the present time. In order to do that I must travel a little outside the scope of this Bill. It will be clearly admitted that if we reduce the rate of postage it will mean a considerable loss of revenue to some of the States. At the present time it is impossible for any one to know what will be the amount of revenue that will be collected during the first year of the existence of the Commonwealth. While I have the very utmost confidence in my right honorable and learned colleague who is considering and framing the Customs Bill, I think no human intelligence can possibly forecast with any accuracy what will be the result of the Customs collections during the first year. There are many factors that have to be taken into consideration ; diminished imports perhaps in some directions, or a change it, may be, in the direction of the industrial activities of the people. Various other matters may interfere to falsify the calculations made by the most far-seeing Minister. </para>

                        <para>- No, we cannot raise them They must be reduced, and, as the penny rate has been adopted in Victoria, there would be only one course if we were equalizing, and that would be to make a reduction in all the States to one penny. That would seriously affect the revenue of. certain States. Instead of having the charges fixed in the Bill, we should let it be: done at some time in the future, when the Governor-General, with the advice of the Postmaster-General, would be able to see by the receipts and expenditure that it was a. reduction that could be safely made. It depends to a great extent upon the revenue that is derived from Customs. In the section of the Constitution Act known as the. Braddon clause- </para>

There is no legal bar.

                        <para>- I am not speaking of newspapers. There is a strong feeling on the part of the community that there should be some charge on newspapers. I am speaking particularly of letters. While we are discussing this matter from the financial point of view, I would like the Senate to understand that the revenue derived from the carriage of letters and post-cards is so enormously greater than the revenue derived from newspapers or anything else thai we can direct our attention almost exclusively to that part of the subject. Seeing that we cannot determine with approximate exactness the amount of revenue which will be returned to the various States under the Braddon clause of the Constitution Act, I think it is inadvisable, and that it would be to a certain extent unjust, to alter the rates of postage in such a way as might add to the financial embarrassment of the States. There will probably be one or two States that will receive back in Customs revenue an amount which will not be equal to the amount they have been receiving in the past. The result of that may be that they will have to look to some other sources for making up the deficiency. </para>

If the Senate generally thinks that this is a power which should not be in the hands of the Postmaster-General, and that Parliament should exercise some control over it, I would suggest an amendment of the clause. I am not advocating an amendment, I am only suggesting that it would be preferable to fixing the rates in a schedule of the Bill to provide that the rates when made shall lay upon the table of the House for a certain time ; and that if they are not disapproved of within the time limit fixed they shall then come into operation. After they have been advertised and laid upon the table for a certain time Parliament, if it disapproves of any particular rate, may express its disapprobation. </para>

Its only desire is to have an Act to work under which will enable it to carry on its work with the greatest possible efficiency. Perhaps some provision of that sort might meet some of the objections which have been made ; at all events, that is an alteration which may be made in clause 19. </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General advocates the passing of this measure because, in his opinion, it will be to the interest of the public that the power of making what he calls slight changes should be vested in the Postmaster-General rather than in Parliament. Whatever changes may be made must necessarily take the direction of either increasing or decreasing the charges on the people. If there is one thing laid down more strongly than another it is that the Parliament alone can levy taxes ; and therefore I look upon the suggestion of handing over to any Minister - even to the present Minister, though I should be very strongly tempted, if he could give a guarantee that he would always be in power, to give him a great deal of power. </para>

                        <para>- On the other hand, there is this danger that the influence which may be brought to bear on a Minister will not be of a slight character, but may be of a very far-reaching character, and in the direction of distinctly benefiting a certain class, it may be, of his own constituents. We have frequently known such things to happen in connexion with the post-office - at least in Victoria. I do not know what may have happened in Queensland. Probably they may be clearly above suspicion in such matters ; but I do not know any department that is more liable, to be used, and has been more used, for favoring a certain class and certain electors than the postal department. I feel that we ought to protect the public, and guard the Minister from undue influence in that direction. Whatever changes are made, I think, should be made by Parliament, or at all events with the entire consent of Parliament. The object of clause 2 is to keep alive in the meantime the existing regulations, fees, rates, and dues. With that I entirely concur. I do not see anything else for it in the meantime. This is a machinery Bill entirely; but I do not think that in a machinery Bill there should be imported into clause 2 or clause 19 a power to alter the incidence of taxation. I desire to keep the Bill entirely what it professes to be - a machinery Bill. On looking into my amendment more closely, I see that it will not fully meet the case. </para>

                <para>Senator Sir FREDERICK SARGOOD.It will not meet the case for this reason - that the word " regulations " is in clause 2, and it clearly should be within the scope of the Minister to alter the regulations. But, with all due deference to the Minister, it should not be in his power or in the power of the Governor in Council to alter the fees, rates, or dues. That, I think, should be restricted entirely to the action of Parliament, and should be brought up, as has always been done in Victoria - I do not know what has been done in the other States. - in a separate Bill dealing with those rates in a schedule. It- is not a common thing to alter the postal rates. It is a thing which happens only occasionally, and it is not- a very serious matter to have to wait for a few months until the changes are made, and made in the way I indicate. </para>

                        <para>- On previous occasions. We altered the postage rate, I am sorry to say, from Id. to 2d. It has always been done here by Act of Parliament. I look upon it as a matter of taxation which should only be dealt with by Parliament and not by any individual Minister. These are the reasons winch I would advance why this clause and clause 19 should not pass, and although the amendment I suggest would not fully meet the case, any amendment made will have to be done in that direction, with the exception that the regulations must be left for the present to the Minister to alter. </para>

                        <para>- It is a commercial department, and conducted on commercial lines, and the rate charged, whether it is a penny, a twopenny, or any other postage, is simply what the State receives for the work it does in transmitting the postal matter of the citizens of Australia. But I would suggest to ray honorable friend, so as to get to a much more important point than is simply involved in the distinction between taxation and non-taxation, to carry over the consideration of the matter to clause 19, because otherwise if we strike out "Governor-General" we shall have landed in the difficulty which he points out of disabling the Governor-General from revoking the regulations which are matters of administration. </para>

If they had waited until the financial conditions permitted it a Bill could have been brought in taking over the post-offices of the States, and fixing uniform rates of postage, and arranging every detail that is necessary at one time. According to this clause the regulations, fees, rates, and dues in a State can be altered at any time. As we have six States we may have six separate proclamations issued by the Governor-General altering the regulations, fees, rates, and dues in each one of the States. </para>

                        <para>- It would be giving no undue preference. Supposing in Queensland, where a rate exists higher than in any other State, the Postmaster-General reduced that rate there would be no preference give. I think I am correct in saying that under this clause the Postmaster-General has power to alter the various rates and dues of every one of the six States. </para>

                        <para>- It has not come to this Chamber. That gives an interpretation of the word Minister, because in a great number of Acts of Parliament, especially those that relate to matters which are sometimes in one department and sometimes in another, the word " Minister" is advisedly used. It would be very inconvenient in an Act of Parliament to speak of the Chief Secretary, and then find afterwards that the Act was being administered by the Minister for Mines or the Minister for Lands. We know that in all the States they have an easy method of transferring these departments :from one Minister to another. Therefore the practice adopted in these Acts is to speak of the Minister, but it is very different with the affairs of the Postal department. They are always administered by the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- If he is away there is a Minister acting for him. The title that is always used by the Minister charged with these functions is the Postmaster-General. That is the title used in Great Britain and in all English-speaking communities, and I think it is not desirable that we should initiate such a revolutionary change as this in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- What I understand the Minister desires is that the term " Postmaster-General " shall be used throughout the Bill as conveying a meaning associated with a particular department, but there is really a more important matter to be considered. I rather agree that the term " Postmaster-General " should be preserved throughout the Bill. It has a special significance, and this is a . measure, of course, that greatly affects the interests and affairs of all the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, who 'would be more likely to understand the term " Postmaster-General " than the word " Minister." </para>

                        <para>- I am not so wedded to the political aspect of the post-office as my honorable and learned friend seems to be. I rather like the railway system, where you get a great executive working department as far as possible removed from political and Ministerial influence. I think in time we may come to follow the example of South Australia by detaching the head of the post-office from politics altogether. It may be so. If it were so, then the definition might be used which would cover " the Minister or officer charged with the administration of this Act for the time being." Perhaps it is looking a long way ahead to foresee any severance between the post-office and the Ministry of the day ; but it may come, and from my point of view it will be advantageous if it does. </para>

                        <para>- The scythe was in use for centuries, but it is now supplanted by the reaper and binder and a number of other things. An honorable senator says we ought to continue to use this term because it has been in use so long. But the expression "Minister for Posts and Telegraphs" would much more accurately describe the office. We all know what Postmaster-General means. It is a fine, round-sounding phrase - a good mouthful. </para>

                    <para>- In discussing this clause I cannot help referring to clauses 5 and 6, because they seem to hang one to another. Clause 4 says the department shall have control ; clause 5 practically says that the Postmaster - General shall have control, while clause 6 says that a principal secretary shall have chief control. I have always been under the impression that the Minister was the one who had sole control of a department, and that everything done in the department was really done in his name. It appears to me that clauses 4, 5, and 6 are absolutely unnecessary. As a matter of law the whole power of the department is vested in the Postmaster-General, and to my mind it is absolutely incorrect to say that the department has control. Clause 5 says that the administration of the Act shall be in the Postmaster-General. </para>

                    <para>- The department is vested in the Postmaster-General by the Commonwealth Constitution Act. All the Acts vesting the post-offices of the various States in the Postirfaster-Generals will be repealed by this measure. The Postmaster-General now exercises authority by virtue of the Commonwealth Constitution Act only. Seeing that we are passing a Post and Telegraph Bill, which is not correctly described as a mere machinery Bill, because it deals with everything in connexion with the post and telegraph services, it is desirable that it should be clearly stated therein what is the position of the department in regard to the Minister administering it, and these three clauses simply bring this about. The local Acts having all gone, it creates first of all a department that has control over the posts and telegraph offices throughout the Commonwealth ; then it says that the Postmaster-General is the head of that department j and next it says that there shall be an officer to be called a principal secretary, who, under the Postmaster-General, shall have control. Surely that is clear. </para>

                    <para>- I think that all the words after the word " Postmaster-General " should be omitted. A principal secretary to the Postmaster-General is all that is wanted. He can only act in the name of the Postmaster-General, who is the head of the department, and administers it. There is not the slightest necessity to go and say that this officer shall have chief control under the Postmaster-General. </para>

                        <para>- I want more. My object is to provide for the necessities of the State from which I come. The population is very evenly distributed over Queensland. The south is settled, the centre is settled, and the north is settled with a probability of much greater settlement in the near future. In the past it lias been found extremely inconvenient that all the strings of administration should be held in one hand in Brisbane, and in the future with the Postmaster-General living in the federal capital, wherever it may be, this state of things will be accentuated. In the past we could get our postal business dealt with and finished in Brisbane, but in the future it will have to filter through Brisbane to the place of Commonwealth administration. If the Postmaster-General provided for three deputy Postmasters-General in Queensland, one with an office in Brisbane, the second with an office in Rockhampton, and the third with an office in Townsville, each being directly responsible to the Minister for the conduct of the business in his own division, the management would be much better, and the thing would work much more smoothly. By adopting this amendment senators will not commit themselves to anything. If the Postmaster-General does not see any need to have more than one deputy in each State he need not appoint more than one ; but if in the interests of better government he finds it necessary to appoint two or three, or more, in each State, 1 think this Bill ought to give him the power.

                    <para>- There are a number of members of the Senate, and a great many people outside, who are greatly disposed to object to the appointment of Deputy Postmasters-General altogether. There are a number of people who hold the opinion that the post-office could be better administered if there were simply a central department, and a number of inspectors going round so as to treat the Commonwealth as one solidified country. But I am disposed to consider that, seeing that the form .under which we live is a union of the States, it is desirable that we should continue the practice which has been adopted hitherto of having a permanent head in each State in the form of a Deputy ' Postmaster-General. The States, I know,, are very desirous that they should not, in. any way, lose their identity ; and I think,, therefore, that it is desirable there should, be a deputy in each State. But in this proposition I think we are going to the other extreme. </para>

One is that the Deputy Postmasters-General should be done away with altogether, and that a policy of centralization should be adopted. Another is that this clause should remain as it is, and </para>

                        <para>-I think it is a very reasonable clause, and we ought to adopt it. It will come very badly from us to take away rights and privileges from our States which they are undoubtedly entitled to, and which we in this Senate are here to maintain I trust that this clause will remain as it is, and that this huge department will be decentralized as much as possible. If that is not done I believe, from a working point of view, we will find we have injured the department I think that confusion is bound to arise in a huge department with ramifications, extending throughout Australia, if every one has to apply to one head at the seat of Government. That will cause a great deal of delay and trouble. </para>
