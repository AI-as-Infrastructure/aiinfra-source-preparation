If a plaintiff in a court fails to set his case down for trial, although. , he has discharged all the preliminary duties devolving on him, the court has. no mercy on him, though, where a plaintiff who appeared in his own behalf, was without proper knowledge, it might permit the resuscitation of the suit on terms. I venture- to think there may be found - of course I must not argue that, there will be found - an. analogy between such a case as I have indicated occurring in a court, and the case which is before the Senate - because of course it is still, before the Chamber. It would perhaps be more convenient for me - I shall be briefer- - to refer to the motion paragraph by paragraph.. I first of all. ask that, the committee will advise the Senate- - </para>

                            <para>- We need not make any unpleasantness, I fancy,, over this matter ; I desire- to deal -with it in the most innocent way possible. There is the fact - it is publicproperty;it is a record of the Commonwealth, and without referring to Hansard, or in any way transgressing any rule of parliamentary etiquette, we know perfectly well that the Prime Minister did move the adoption of a report from a parliamentary Committee of Elections and Qualifications, which laid it down very clearly and very positively that the law of Western Australia does govern election petitions from that State. Then we find - -and this is why I inserted that particular paragraph - that in this Chamber another Minister of the Crown, also a King's counsel, moved an exactly opposite motion, which says in effect that the law of Western Australia, does not govern, these petitions. When , we have so. remarkable a conflict of authority- in- the Cabinet itself, and1 amongst the ranks of His Majesty's counsel, I think it is well and absolutely needful that there should be some authoritative statement on so- vexed a question, because we may have amy number of petitions coming in. I do not know whether Western Australia can supply anymore; it has- shown a prolificacy- of petitions so far, and possesses, the record. But it is not only the question of1 the law of Western Australia which is involved. We want an authoritative statement of the question as to. what . law will govern- any other petitions that may come -in before we have some distinct regulations or standing orders to govern these matters beyond the realm of cavili </para>

                    <para>SenatorLt.-Col. NEILD. - Very good, ; sir. I might, if it were worth -while . to refer to the matter further, do so by way of personal -explanation. You, sir, would be the first to protect my interests in doing so, if it were necessary ; but I let that pass. Surely the question of party politics . need not be brought in. Surely I have uttered no word this afternoon tinged with party politics, and my speech made the other day, in which I announced my intention to vote for the motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, -showed no evidence of party politics. I believe there is only one subject which constitutes any line of demarcation amongst members of this' Senate, and that is the fiscal question, and surely the division list on this motion the. other day showed that. </para>

                            <para>- I say that the division on 'the motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, showed that whatever line of demarcation there may -be 'between- senators on the subject of the fiscal question, -there was no evidence of it in dealing -with that motion. I need not go into matters of a personal character,- as to why my name does not appear in 'that division list. I let- -that pass. I move this motion, as I have already pointed out, for the purpose of clearing up these (important facts, that seem to largely influence the decision of this Chamber, and to clear -up, if possible, all 'doubts as to legal procedure. It will also limit the future discussion of this matter, and tend to cause its settlement with very much less waste of time, and very much less heat of speech, and very much more freedom from anything that -partakes of a party character than could be hoped for, if the questions involved were to come before the Chamber a second time surrounded with all the elements of doubt as to law, and -uncertainties as to the accuracy of facts that we saw was the case last week. I' move the motion in the hope that it will be carried, and that it will tend to -simplify our procedure in the future, and to establish some precedent for our future working. It is well known to every member of this Chamber that we have few precedents to guide us in so many cases,--and it is eminently needful 'that we should proceed carefully, as we are making precedents for those who will come after us as well' as for ourselves in the future. It is desirable that each step should be taken on a sure foundation, that we may not be- misled by -false views or distorted ideas of ' fact, or a lack of confidence in facts asserted, 'thatwe may go- on carefully putting together these, precedents that will be of so much (advantage to- us in the future, and, I trust, to those who will later on occupy the seats that we now fill. </para>

                            <para>- What I wish to point out particularly is that the resolution says nothing about the law of Western Australia or any other law. Whether we take our law from precedent or the law that prevails in similar cases in the House of Commons or anywhere else, the affirmation by the Senate on that occasion was, to slightly alter the wording, " that there is nothing in the law to prevent that petition from being considered." I say I can perceive no inconsistency between the action of the Prime Minister in moving the adoption of the report of the Committee of Elections and Qualifications appointed by another place, and the action of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in moving and supporting the motion which was carried by the Senate. </para>

Knowing that the petition was here, and that, according to the law of Western Australia, it was properly in the hands of the Senate, he considered it was his duty, as leader of the Senate as well as representative of the Government, to see that it was dealt with in a proper way according to law, and that was the action he took. There was no word at that time, nor for a long time afterwards, of any party complexion being given to this matter. </para>

                            <para>- In justice to Senators O'Connor and Best it would be very desirable if they were present at the next sitting when this question is discussed. I hope that an honorable senator will move the adjournment of the debate. I have no personal interest in the matter. I have endeavoured as a member of the court - the committee - to do justice between man and man, and it has annoyed me exceedingly to read in certain newspapers that this is a matter in which the Government and the Opposition take opposite sides. It is well-known that several of us on this side voted with the majority, and that members of the other side voted with the minority, and that- the third party was divided. I fail to see then why the public should think this a party question. </para>

The probability is that in any case there will have to be an adjournment of the committee, so that practically no unnecessary delay will occur. </para>

                        <para>- I think it would be much more convenient to resume the debate on Thursday. A number of honorable senators come here from the north and south on Wednesday, and it is asking too much to expect them, just after arriving by train, and before they have collected their thoughts, or regulated their papers, to debate this question. No harm can come from postponing the debate until Thursday, even if the committee have to sit a little later. </para>

                    <para>This is another of the Bills which have been described as machinery Bills, but I think all honorable senators will admit that it is a Bill of first-class importance. So far we have been getting along with the Public Service Acts as they are in the several States, but it must be evident to all that it is desirable at the earliest moment, without, of course, undue haste, that we should have a Public Service Act applicable to the public servants who have been appointed under the Commonwealth Government, or who have been transferred with the great transferred departments'. It will be generally admitted, I think, that the great object to be attained is to get a public service which will consist of men who are competent to perform their duties, and also to make that body so attractive that we may be able to get the services of the best men in' all the States. It is not desirable that we should have a public service consisting of a vast number of persons who are perhaps not qualified for their duties, and are not sufficiently paid. It is much better to have a. smaller number of highly efficient and well paid men than to have a larger number of men who are not equal to their duties, and whose remuneration is inferior, because, though in that way, we may be giving, as it were, relief to a number of persons, the result ultimately must be that the service will become less attractive to good men, and the public convenience will not be so well served with such a vast number of civil servants as there will be, including those in the transferred departments ; it will be a very great work, especially considering the vast extent of our territory, to go through all the offices and ascertain the qualifications of the men. We cannot reasonably expect that within a short time any body of persons who may be appointed to discharge that duty will be able to make themselves as acquainted as they should be with the working of all the departments in the six States. But I think all will admit that the most important thing is to secure the right type of man to be at the head of the public service, and to discharge the duties laid down in this Bill. We require a man who will be, not only thoroughly efficient, but superior to all influences political or social. The very great difficulty which has to be faced at the outset is to find a man who will fulfil those qualifications. The Bill proposes that there shall be one commissioner, who will be charged with the duty of administering the Act, and seeing that it is impossible for one man without assistance to do the. work which is required, he will be provided with a number of inspectors, not exceeding six. The inspectors will act under his instructions, and assist him in discharging the duties required of him. The Bill is divided into five parts - namely, administration, division of public service and appointments, internal administration, life assurance, and miscellaneous. In the first part we find the provisions dealing with the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner and the inspectors. I would draw attention to the conditions which are required with regard to the commissioner, and the provisions of the Bill in this respect are similar to those in other Bills which have been before the Senate. It is required that the commissioner, who will receive a salary of £1,500 a year, shall not engage in any paid employment outside the duties of his office. </para>

                            <para>- Although in one respect the Auditor-General may be regarded as an officer of more importance, the Public Service Commissioner will undoubtedly have very much more work to do. He will not be able to engage in any paid employment outside the duties of his office, and he vacates . his office if he becomes insolvent or compounds with his creditors, and also if he absents himself. from duty for 14 consecutive days, or for28 days in any 12 months. The term for which he is appointed is seven years. He cannot be removed except by an address from both Houses of Parliament, but he may be suspended from his office by the Governor-General ; and if he is suspended a statement has to be made to Parliament within seven days, if Parliament is sitting, or, if it is not in session, within seven days after the commencement of the next session. The commissioner is to be restored to his office, unless within 42 days both Houses of Parliament, by resolution, declare that he ought to be removed. But if within those 42 days a resolution is not passed by both Houses, stating that he ought to be removed, he goes back to his position. With regard to the inspectors, they are to be appointed under similar conditions. They are to receive £800 per annum each. Their term of service is the same - seven years - and they have the same tenure, and are subject to the same conditions. They are to act under the instructions of the com- missioner. The duties of the inspectors are described in clause 8 and the following clauses. It is there stated that the duty of each inspector is to - </para>

                            <para>- No, because the inspectors act under the instructions of the commissioner. The inspectors represent the eyes and ears of the commissioner. These inspectors will go about into every department. They are charged with the duty of finding out the work that is done, how many men are employed, what are the duties they fulfil, and, so far as they can, the capabilities of the individuals employed ; and they report to the commissioner. In the case of appointments and transfers, it will be found throughout the Bill, that the permanent head makes a report to the commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- Not necessarily. There may not be six inspectors appointed. The limit is six, but there may be a smaller number, and one inspector is not to be assigned to each State, because, it may be desirable to divide the Commonwealth into districts which will not coincide with the States. The inspectors will go' about and inquire into matters for the commissioner, and then in making appointments and promotions the permanent head has to make a report to the commissioner, and the commissioner will recommend to the Governor-General, whereupon, if the Governor-General does not approve, the proposal is sent back to the commissioner, for him to make a fresh proposal ; but in every such case a statement of the objections to the proposal is to be made within a certain time to Parliament. It is believed that, in this way, we shall get machinery which will result in obtaining a public service as good as we can get. It will- be the best way of getting over the difficulty of having a Minister who might be inclined to be an autocrat and a commissioner who would be inclined to entirely disregard the wishes of a permanent head of a department. </para>

                            <para>- The trouble in the past has been that in the States where there has not been a Public Service Board positions have been filled through political influence, and in many cases the departments have been overmanned. Sometimes two officers have been doing the work- of one man. It is in consequence of abuses of that kind being created that three of the States have taken the opportunity of appointing Public Service Boards. In each case three gentlemen have been appointed to act as a board, but in some instances the system has not worked very well, because although you have three highly-paid men sitting round a table dealing with the public service, and you perhaps get the united wisdom of those men, you have no inspection. You cannot exercise any supervision without inspectors. The principle adopted in this Bill is that we shall -have one commissioner, and then, to assist the one commissioner, there shall be a number of inspectors, whose business it will be to be outside the office. I do not know whether any other system could be adopted as good as this that could be carried out. for a less expenditure. If the commissioner finds that there are two men in any department where one would do, he may transfer the excess number ; or, if that method of relieving the congestion is not open to him, he may stop all appointments and promotions until the expansion of the work of the office has once more become proportionate to the staff. In case of an excess of officers the sixth sub-section of clause 8 comes into operation, but it is not a provision that we should like to see put into force unless it were unavoidable. It is as follows : - </para>

                            <para>- I would hardly put it in that way, because, as I have said before, the inspectors are the eyes and ears of the commissioner. They have to go about and report to the commissioner, and the commissioner digests the information they furnish to him, and takes any action he chooses under the circumstances. I think that is the better way of putting it. Then there -are powers given to the commissioner to summon witnesses and take evidence on oath, and he is required to furnish -a report at least once a -year -as to the condition and efficiency of the public service, which report is to be published. With regard to the work of the separate divisions, although this refers to all the departments, it -is chiefly important in :connexion with the Government transferred departments. My own department, the Post and Telegraph, department, is of course the largest. It is so much larger than any other department that it -is a leviathan amongst the minnows, so far as the number of persons employed is concerned. Of the other three departments, the Defence department - excluding the soldiers - is comparatively small, and the number of the officers in the Customs department is likewise comparatively small. </para>

                            <para>- Only the soldiers are . excluded ; the civil officers are dealt with under the Bill. In the Postal department we have, I think, speaking from memory, 8,000 or 9, COO officers, and we have in each of the States a Postal department that has been up to the present time complete in itself. The title given to the officer who is; next to the Minister in one of these transferred departments is that of permanent head. He has generally been called undersecretary in the past. He is next to the Minister in the work of administering the department, whether1 it is a transferred or any other department. That is dealt with in clause 1 2. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it may be possible to get such an individual. I remember that Emerson in one of his essays mentions that a friend of his, speaking of the domestic problem, told him that he had been sent down town by his wife to procure an angel .to do plain cooking. To get a man to occupy this high position, who would be entirely free from all social influence we should have to get some one angelic. But at all events we can try to dissociate the officer from political and social influences. </para>

                            <para>- Assuredly. The chief officer of a department is- the person in charge of the department in one of the States. Take the Post-office for example, and the same system will apply to every transferred department. We have had in the past a permanent head under the Minister in each of the States. The permanent heads have been called postmasters-general or deputy postmasters-' general or sometimes under-secretarys Under this Bill, as I have explained, they will become chief officers. It is just as well that honorable senators should carefully impress that point upon their minds when going through the Bill, otherwise errors will be made. The permanent head is the officer who comes next to the Minister as Hie head of the whole department, embracing the branches of the department in the various States, and the chief officer is the highest officer of a department in any particular State. </para>

He is a member of the Executive Council, and, consequently, his influence only comes in where the Governor-General in Council acts. Seeing that the Governor-General in Council acts upon the advice of the Minister, the Minister will merely act as a member of the Executive Council. </para>

                            <para>- What I understand is this : Apparently the commissioner, acting with the assistance of six inspectors, discovers everything that is going on in the various departments, and he reports to the Governor General, which is a report to the Executive Council. Upon that report the Governor-General acts. The commissioner has no further power than to make an investigation and to report. </para>

                            <para>- That is. so. If the commissioner's recommendation is not accepted, the Governor-General sends it back for another recommendation, but in that case a statement of the grounds upon which the recommendation has been rejected is to be laid before Parliament. That is where the Ministerial influence may come in. But where Ministerial influence is exercised against the recommendation of the commissioner Parliament must be informed. That is a check, and will operate against what may be called Ministerial interference with the work of the commissioner. </para>

                            <para>- If we substitute one for the four there will be no check. In view of the discussion some time ago, when some members of the Senate were exercised in their minds in regard to the form of an Appropriation Bill, I may point out that this Bill makes it clear what is the position of Parliament in regard to its own officers. The clerical staffs of the Senate and the House of Representatives are to become departments in themselves. The Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff are also separate departments. You, sir, occupy the position that would otherwise be occupied by the commissioner. The Speaker and the President are substituted for the commissioner, and the Clerk of the Senate takes the position that would be occupied by the permanent head or chief officer. With regard to the Library and Parliamentary Reporting Staffs, they are placed under the control of the President and Speaker. So that in the case of the Senate it would be the President, as commissioner, who would make a recommendation, after having received a report from the Clerk, as permanent head. </para>

For the first six years he is entitled, upon the certificate of the commissioner, to an increase of £20 per annum for each succeeding twelve months until he . gets £160. If a particular officer does well and gets the certificate, he will get up to the top of the fifth division in six years, and then he will be in receipt of £160. The first two increases are automatic, and then the increases are automatic, but subject to merit. </para>

                            <para>- This will apply also to females in the service, but the Senate will have to carefully consider whether a provision of this kind will not tend to diminish the amount of employment that can be found for women, because it is an almost universal principle that the wages of men should be somewhat higher than those paid to women. We know that for a long time past women have been endeavouring to get employment in the public service, and in private service as well," and they have been willing and able in many cases to get employment at lower wages than men. Though they may be equal in .some respects, they claim certain consideration on account of sex. If we are going to say that, with regard to salaries, sex shall be taken into consideration, and that on account of sex women shall receive special consideration, then in the long run those who do not desire or expect this consideration must be employed to a larger extent than those who do require it. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, I think so. I could never see myself why the sex should make a difference in the salaries. I do not think that is what does make the difference. It is a matter of capacity and working ability . In private employment, women have been working their way, and a number of people requiring clerks are employing young ladies, but they pay them lower salaries than would probably be paid to men. The young ladies have been very glad to get into the employment, but if we told a merchant that he must pay the same salary to women as to men, he would probably say that he would prefer to employ the men. </para>

                            <para>- If the women can do the work as well as the men, no doubt they will be able to command the same salary, but if they cannot do the work, and we make a fixed rule that the same salary must attach whether the operator is a man or a woman, the preference will be given to the man, and I am afraid the women will be crowded out. Of course those that are in the service will be all right ; it is a very good thing for them. There are a great number of females in the service who are getting at this age £50 and £60 a year. It will be a great thing for them to have their salaries at once doubled, but how will it affect the number of young ladies who would like to get into the service ? I think it will have the effect of diminishing the amount of employment for women. I have discharged my duty in drawing attention to the matter, and I hope that in committee it will be thoroughly discussed. </para>

A civil servant in Victoria who is doing exactly the same work as a civil servant in Tasmania, will find himself immediately placed in the higher subdivision or in a higher class if we take the salary standard.

                            <para>- I really do not see how we can do anything else. That is one of the tasks which the commissioner has before him. It is a task which no one will be inclined to envy him. There is a very great discrepancy in the salaries which have been paid in the various States, and he has to set to work with the provision of the Constitution before him that every officer who has been transferred shall retain all his rights and privileges, and at the same time he has to endeavour to do equal justice to all civil servants throughout the Commonwealth. It is a most difficult problem, and if the honorable and learned senator objects to the principle that is laid down in the Bill, perhaps he can make a suggestion as to how the matter may be dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- That is quite correct. The method of obtaining appointments is dealt with in clause 26. Clause 27 gives power to the Governor-General to make regulations for examinations. Every person who comes into the civil service has to pass a preliminary medical examination to test his health, and also an educational examination. It is very desirable that there should be a medical examination. If we get men into the civil service in weak health they may become unequal to the performance of their duties, and it would be almost impossible to dispense with their services. I do not think it is desirable to take any weaklings into the civil service. It should not be looked upon as a sort of asylum. There are persons who are afflicted from birth with ill-health and who never get strong. I think that public or private charity should look after such persons, and the public service for many reasons should not be used for their relief. I know that in administering departments in Queensland it was most objectionable to get a person who was suffering from some disease like consumption working in an office with a number of civil servants. I cannot imagine anything more unsatisfactory than that. Such persons are better provided for by some benevolent and charitable institution than in the public service. Clause 28 provides for separate examinations to be held to test the efficiency and aptitude of candidates for employment in the different divisions. I have no doubt that on the recommendation of the commissioner the Governor-General will prescribe such examinations as really will disclose the working ability of the candidates. Perhaps in the past too much stress has been laid on purely educational qualifications. The tendency of modern times is to model the examinations in such a way as to find out what the abilities of the candidate are. The commissioner is required from time to time to give public notice of the number of new appointments which it is estimated will have to be made, the division, class, or grade thereof, and the times and places of examination. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill has been framed on those lines ; it is designed to prevent the political head from interfering in the work of the department, where transfers are concerned up to the time when they come before him as a member of the Executive Council. He has power to dissent from a recommendation, but in every case a statement has to be laid' before Parliament. Suppose a permanent head wants to make an appointment in a department, and the Minister objects to it. The permanent head makes his report" to the commissioner. The commissioner recommends the appointment. It then goes to the Minister as a member of the Executive Council ; the Minister says - " I do not agree with that appointment. That is not the man I want, and I will not have him." The Executive Council sends it back, supposing that the Minister's colleagues are with him in the matter. In that case a statement of the reasons for the objection have to be laid before Parliament. In some States where the principle of Ministerial control is very strong, the Minister would simply say - " I will not have the appointment made - appoint so and so," and probably no one would know the reason why the person selected had not been appointed. It would be seen perhaps that a man had been passed over, but no one would know why. It would be simply the Minister who would have done it. But, in this case, the permanent head makes his report, the commissioner makes his recommendation, the Governor-General then intervenes, and a statement has to be laid before Parliament, showing that the permanent head made a certain recommendation, and why the Executive Council disapproved of it. </para>

                            <para>- Clause 42 is very important indeed. It deals with a matter that has been a cause of difficulty in all the States, and that is the principle upon which promotions are to be made, whether by merit or according to seniority. Generally, when the question is raised, every one says that promotion should' be made according to merit, but when you take a concrete instance, you find a complaint made that some one who is senior has been passed over. There is also the question whether appointments should be made within one department, or from one department to another; and a third question of whether appointments should be confined to the public service, or whether the commissioner should be entitled to go outside the service, if necessary. This Bill deals with these matters, and the principle which has been adopted is that in the first place promotion is to go by merit. But if there are two officers of equal merit, then seniority is to count. I think that is the best way of settling it. The clause reads in this way - </para>

                            <para>- That would certainly be one of the Conditions upon which the company would take the business. Certain regulations will be laid down, and if certain companies will not undertake the business of insuring civil servants upon those terms, then the officers will have to go to other companies. This is a substitute for the system of Government insurance. It will be laid down by regulation what conditions must be complied with, and the civil servants themselves must -make arrangement with some company or other. If one company will not comply with the conditions another will. Probably all the best offices will be competing for the business. There is another provision to which I must refer upon this subject. That is that in case of a person being unable to insure his life, or in case the companies load his life for more than five years - that is to say, in case of a person who cannot very well get insured - we make provision for a deduction from his salary to take the place of insurance. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator should not jump before he comes to the stile. The insurance by the Government simply consists in their deducting a certain sum from a man's salary from month to month, and when he arrives at a certain age, or leaves the service, he is just paid the amount he paid in with interest. </para>

                            <para>- No ; it is simply compelling him, to save a little money. Insurance is decided upon actuarial calculation, and is a sort of speculation as to whether a man is going to get more or less. In the case of transferred officers, where they have contributed to a superannuation fund, they are required to continue their payments, so that they do not come under the class of persons who are not insured. </para>

                            <para>- Only in the way the matter is dealt with by the clauses to which I have just referred, requiring an officer to insure his life in a private office. Clause 60 is, I think, almost a transcript of the section of the Constitution Act reserving the rights of civil servants who are transferred. It is just as well that it should be there. Clauses 61 and 62 also provide for cases where officers have been transferred. Clause 63 deals with the rather vexed question of rent chargeable for quarters. Honorable senators who have had anything to do with administration know how difficult it is to arrange with regard to giving quarters to officers. I think the provision made here is equitable. An officer is sometimes transferred from a position where he has quarters to a position where he has not quarters, and in lieu of quarters he gets an addition to his salary. The next time he gets a change he claims the addition in lieu of quarters as a part of his salary, and will consider he is reduced if it is taken from him. He takes the increased salary with him, which includes the allowance for rent, perhaps, to a place where there are quarters, and he quietly goes into the new quarters with the higher salary, and perhaps also asks for promotion. The Bill provides that in all cases of transfer there shall be a certain estimated value for quarters, and that value is to be deducted, and is to be considered as part of the salary. Clause 63 provides - </para>

In calculating for any purpose the rate of salary of such officer, the amount so deducted as rent shall be deemed and taken to be part of his salary. </para>

                            <para>- No. I think it is mandatory, and it is right that it should be so. The same rule applies all round. We never say that the Governor-General " shall" do a thing. There is a provision that in the case of a man becoming unfit or incapable of discharging his duty the Governor-General may deal with him on the recommendation of the commissioner. If a man is convicted of any crime, or becomes insolvent on account of his own misconduct, power is given to the Governor-General to dismiss him or to punish him by fine or reprimand. The Bill, also lays down the amount of leave of absence that may be given for recreation or . in case of sickness. For purposes of recreation an officer may have eighteen days1 leave in each year, and. there is a proviso that in remote parts of the Commonwealth the leave may be extended. In case of sickness an officer may be given three months' leave by the Minister, and if he is not right then the Governor-General may extend that leave to twelve months. If the officer after the twelve months is still unable to return to his work he may get six months additional leave without pay. If after that he cannot come to his work, I suppose, the case must be regarded as hopeless, and his services must be dispensed with. Leave of absence may be given under certain circumstances without pay where a man is not sick. The Governor-General, on the recommendation of the commissioner, may grant twelve months' leave without pay. Then there is a provision in clause 70 that if a man has been twenty years in the service, or ten years if he joined at the age of 30, the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the commissioner, give him twelve months' leave of absence - -six months on full, and six on half -pay. Clause 71 deals with holidays, and clause 72 deals with the retirement of officers. At 60 years of age a man is entitled to retire. Between 60 and 65 he may be called upon to retire at any time by the Governor-General, and when he is 65 years of age he must retire - </para>

                    <para>- -It will be in the recollection of honorable senators that when this clause was previously under consideration, believing as I do that the salary here proposed for the Auditor-General was not sufficient, I proposed that it should be increased from £1,000 to £1,500. At the time I proposed the amendment the constitutional aspect of the question had not occurred to me. I do not regret having moved the amendment because it was the occasion of an exceedingly interesting discussion upon the whole constitutional question and the Senate has perhaps grasped the Constitution a great deal more clearly now than it did previously. There are- two points involved in the matter. The first is as to the power of the Senate to make an amendment in this particular Bill. That was very ably discussed, and I will now only indicate my own opinion after listening with considerable attention to what has been said in all parts of the Chamber.' My contention is that this Bill is one which the Senate can amend, and that it does not come within the category of Bills appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. But then, according to my idea, it docs come within the next subsection of section 53. </para>

                        <para>- The theory of the British Constitution, and I think the theory correctly illustrates the process which is carried out. First of all we have the Committee of Supply which decides how much is going to be granted for carrying on the services of the Crown, and then we call in the Committee of Ways and Means to decide how that amount is to be found. First of all we decide how much our expenditure is going to be, and then we turn to find out how we are going to raise that money. If that be so to whatever extent we increase the amount of our grant we must increase the amount of our taxation. If for instance we propose to grant half-a-million we go into Committee of Ways and Means to decide how that money is to be raised. If at some stage that sum has been increased by resolution to £600,000, then the Committee of Ways and Means has to decide how £600,000 is to be raised. </para>

                        <para>- I connect it with our Constitution. What we are trying to decide is, what is meant by the expression increasing a burden or a charge on the people, and seeing that the language which is used is language which has been used in all British speaking countries, we have aright, I think, to go to the British Constitution to find out what those words mean, and in that way it becomes justifiable to argue from the practice which is carried out under the Constitution. Coming back to my argument, if that additional £100,000 has to' be raised by taxation, clearly the resolution of the House, at whatever stage, that £100,000 more should be granted, is the act which has increased .the burden or charge on the people. </para>

                        <para>- It has worked out fairly well hitherto, during the short experience we have had of it ; and just as we have engrafted responsible government on our Federal Constitution, so we must necessarily have recourse - because our written Constitution is not exhaustive - to the well-established rules and procedure of the British Constitution in relation to all matters that are not strictly provided for under our own Constitution. If we are not to do so we shall be like a barque launched upon a new political sea, with equipment derived from a country of which we have had long and historical experience, but in the management of which barque we are not to have recourse to that equipment. We have to look to the President of the Senate to determine the rights of this Chamber, and the relations between the two Houses. In this regard I hope - and I am sure - that he will listen to arguments from both sides before arriving at a final decision, which may be important as upholding the rights of the Senate in regard to the power of initiation and all provisions of this kind. I hope the President will not allow those rights to be whittled away by any attempt on the part of the other Chamber - although it may be unconscious - to limit our powers. There is one other matter to which I would refer, and that is with regard to the provision of the Constitution which uses the expression " charge or burden." .It appears to me that the words " charge or burden," as used there, mean those taxes imposed by the Parliament which are directly placed upon the people. They mean money directly taken out of the pockets of the people. </para>

                        <para>- A tax Bill. The phrase does not mean - and I do not know any constitutional authority who says so - expenditure out of the money which has already been voted by Parliament. On the one hand a burden is laid on the people in order to raise revenue. That is the only charge or burden of which they are cognisant. Then the money is disbursed in paying salaries and meeting the expenses connected with the Government, and so on. But it is the former which is a " charge or burden " on the people. I do not think this proposed .salary of £1,000 a year is a charge on the people, for instance. The charge on the people would be the tax by winch the revenue was raised out of which that particular salary is to be paid. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt. We are arriving at no conclusion, however ; and whilst it is useful to have our minds instructed on the subject, I hope the question will be distinctly raised, and that we shall then get an authoritative ruling upon it. Because, on this matter, we can only be guided by an authoritative ruling from the Chair when the question is directly raised.The' constitutional way is to raise the point, and ask for a ruling from the Chairman of Committees, and then let the House resume, discuss the whole matter, argue it out, and have it settled by a ruling which will become, until it is altered, the law and practice of the Senate upon the subject. </para>

                        <para>-No; the other Chamber has said there is to be a salary of £1,000 per annum paid to the Auditor-General, and the words that follow include the word "appropriated." Those following words are wholly needless, and I doubt whether they can be found in any other Act. In the Commonwealth Act they do not appear. There is a provision for the payment of a given sum to the different Ministers, for the payment of a sum to the Governor-General, and for the payment of sums to members of the Legislature. Those are statutory obligations which have to be fulfilled. The money is not voted year by year ; it is paid without discussion, without cavil. It is not voted at all, strictly speaking, because it is a statutory charge that must be complied with unless the law is altered. There- is no need for the particular words of winch I have spoken, specifying that the amount is " appropriated accordingly.'" It is sufficient for us to have a statutory obligation to pay the amount, and I shall therefore, at the earliest moment, move the omission of these appropriating words so as to let the clause terminate with the word "fund." That is to say, I shall move, to strike out the words - </para>

                        <para>- I have not. We may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. Now, we have in England an actual definition of what is meant by a charge or burden, and it is that mode of obtaining money whereby the Committee of Ways and Means approaches the public. The section therefore says that we shall have no power to amend a law whose purpose is to increase a burden or charge by which we are going to approach the people. It clearly has only reference to a law for getting in money from the public. </para>

                    <para>- We have here a very important question to consider in regard to the Constitution, which I do not think has been properly appreciated up to the present time. Section 53 of the Constitution is a negativing section. It relates to the laws which we may not introduce. Laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. That is the only qualification. With the exception of laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, we can originate any laws, and if we quibble with that we travel away from the foundation, of the Constitution which the Convention endeavoured to frame on the soundest lines. The whole question then comes to this - and I ask honorable senators to follow me in this connexion, because it has not been put yet - Could we have introduced this Bill? There we get at the root of the thing. If we could have introduced the Bill, away goes all the argument that has been used about the rights of the Senate. There is the crucial test, and I am standing here by the Constitution and fighting for the rights of the Senate. If we introduced a Bill dealing simply with appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation pure and simple, we would be offending against the very purview of section 53. Would we not ? Possibly, if these words stood alone - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys or imposing taxation shall not originate in the Senate- and were not qualified by what comes afterwards, and we introduced a Bill which related to other matters, but which incidentally appropriated revenue which means general revenue, and not particular revenue for the particular purpose of machinery for imposing taxation, there might be some difficult}'. But we do not stop there at all, and we who made the Constitution did not stop there. We who knew what we were doing, and explained what we were doing, which everybody understood at the time, went on to say - </para>
                <para>But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys Or to impose taxation by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law. </para>
                <para>Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys or imposing taxation shall not originate in the Senate. </para>
                <para>But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys or to impose taxation by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation .... of fees for services under the proposed law. </para>
                <para>Now it is sought to have our Constitution frittered away by it being said that fees for services would not cover salaries. Do we quibble over the word "fee," a lawyer's term 1 Do fees for services mean remuneration for services which can or cannot be recovered ? We cannot have bigger words than the words we put in advisedly for the express purpose of saving the rights of the Senate - for- the express purpose of seeing that although we had no right to deal with the ordinary Appropriation Bill of the year, we had a right to introduce Bills which imposed duties and required fees, to use the objectionable word - or which required money to be paid for them, to use the more colloquial term - which imposed duties and the necessary remuneration for the performance of them, and that we should be limited to that, and should not be tied down to the narrow precedents - which some of us never get over - of the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council. We were embarking on a new scheme in which one House was not to represent one class and the other the other, but in which one was to represent all the people and the other all the States. I am simply shocked when I see honorable senators who I think ought always to bear in their mind the downright cardinal principle which underlies this Constitution, wavering for a second about its great underlying principles, which, if we sacrifice in this initial Parliament, we sacrifice for ever. That is really what we have to consider at the present time. We have, at the beginning of our Constitution, to remember that, as the Christian religion is not only made up of the 39 articles, but is made up of a great many things which are superadded to them ; that as the American Constitution does not consist simply of its articles, but is also made up of a good many very wise and clever understandings that have been well added to them ; so our Constitution will prove within its four comers absolutely inefficient unless we add to them conventions which will become greater than the articles themselves, which will be embedded therein by the good understanding of all of us, and of the people at the back of us, and become as sincere parts of it, as the words which we have inefficiently written and adopted. We have to recognise that, underlying this question, which crops out as a side issue, we have a very big constitutional principle. I would ask Senators Harney and Clemons - very clever men whom I respect very much - to apply this test to the question : Is this not a Bill winch we could have introduced here ? </para>

                        <para>- If it is a Money Bill in the ordinary sense of the term, one of the class of Bills which we cannot amend and cannot introduce, we cannot alter a single word of it. We have to adopt it through and through, and. every possible alteration we desire has to come by way of suggestion. To my mind there can be two views about that. But, standing by the lights of the Senate and standing by the Constitution which I think we have safely established, I submit that this is a Bill which we could have introduced ourselves. We could have introduced a Bill providing for the audit of accounts. We could provide a salary. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend is taking rather a professional view of it. I simply say that, by the concession which was made - because it was not a grant, but a concession - for there were some who wanted to prevent the two Houses being in the same position as the Senate and the House of Representatives in America - were we not to interfere with Appropriation Bills and Bills imposing taxation. But at the same time we reserved to the Senate the power of amending any other Bill, although in its incidence it imposed penalties or prescribed fees. Say a Bill imposes penalties. We have a perfect right to introduce a Bill into this Senate dealing with public matters, imposing huge responsibilities on persons who offend against it, punishing them by fine and imprisonment. There can be no question about that. Are my honorable friends opposite, who want to weaken the Constitution, going to say that, whilst we can impose huge penalties of fine and imprisonment, we cannot pay the salaries of officers who are to prevent the necessity of either of those responsibilities of fine and imprisonment being incurred at all, so as to make prevention better than cure ? If the powers on the one side with regard to imposing penalties are big enough, are not the powers on the other side in regard to the payment of fees for services big enough ? </para>

                        <para>- What special Act? There is no Act which we have to deal with at present except the Commonwealth Act itself. The Act fixes the position of the Judges and decides everything. We have power to legislate, and those powers come from that Act and nowhere else. Therefore we have to consider everything simply and solely in the atmosphere and under the enactments of the Commonwealth Act. I venture to say distinctly that if on this occasion we decide that we have no power to amend this Bill, we shall be denying rights we have fought for and have obtained under the Commonwealth Act. A great deal of trouble was taken about this point in the Convention, and if we are going to allow the House of Representatives to ride roughshod over us by saying that we are not entitled to introduce Bills of this kind - because that is what it comes to - we are giving them a great deal more than the framers of the Constitution intended to give them. I say unhesitatingly that we could have introduced this Bill in the Senate, and as it could have been, introduced here, we can amend it. </para>

                        <para>- We might have required a Governor-General's message, because we do not want to go beyond the letter of the Constitution. The Senate is not, by the accident of where the Bill was introduced, to be prevented from asserting the initial rights that we should have had if the Bill had been introduced in this Chamber. It will be a great pity if we make a mistake in this matter. It will be particularly a most regrettable mistake at this time when we are practically arranging what the Constitution means. There appears to me to be a misunderstanding arising out of the supposition that this is a Bill that we could not have introduced ourselves. The root of the matter is - could the Bill have been introduced in the Senate ? That question goes root and branch to the whole question of whether we can amend the Bill or not. </para>

                        <para>- This is a discussion with a view of clearing our intellects and of enabling lis at a later period to deal with the matter conclusively and finally when the question arises. Paragraph 3 provides that we may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. That, I venture to submit, fits in as a limitation upon sub-sections (2) and (4). Paragraph 2 says that we may not amend, and sub-section (4) says that we may amend in a particular way. Paragraph 4 says that we may amend in a particular way, and it is merely a matter of method ; but paragraph 3 says that we cannot even do that. We cannot even make a suggestion which will have the effect of increasing a charge or burden on the people. </para>

                        <para>- The whole governing words are contained in paragraphs 2 and 4. First of all it is said we may not amend certain proposed laws at all, and then comes paragraph 4, which says we may amend* in a particular fashion. '&gt; If we put paragraph 3 after paragraph 4, the thing seems as clear as possible. If the paragraphs had been arranged in that way, there could not have been a doubt, because paragraph 3 would then have been read as. a proviso.

                        <para>- Sub-section (2) tells us what the Senate may not do. We may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation. Then sub-section (3) says the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people, and it is as plain as a pike-staff to me that, with this small limitation, it is clear that we can amend certain laws. I contend that the Bill we have before us now is one of the special measures which we can amend, and which was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution when they put in sub-section (3). Unless that is so sub-section (3) is nonsense, because it would otherwise be absolutely covered by sub-section (2). </para>

                        <para>- It would be covered in every way. Sub-section (2) says what we may not amend, and then the, section goes on to say, in sub-section (3), that there are some laws that we may amend, so long as we do not increase the charges or burdens upon the people. The implication is as plain as possible. The Senate may not amend any proposed laws so as to increase any proposed charge or burden upon the people, and the implication is clear that they may amend such laws except in those particulars. I think the framers of the Constitution in dealing with sub-section (3) had in their minds a class of Bill precisely like this Audit Bill, because there is only one clause dealing in the slightest way with the appropriation of revenue, and all the rest is , pure machinery for the purpose of giving effect to the Bill. There may be in such a Bill as that a proposal for a salary to some officer to carry out the provisions of the Bill, and the Constitution says that the Senate shall not amend that in such a way as to increase that salary. </para>

I wish to protest against the unfair position in which we have been placed by the action of the honorable senator who led us' on, and then refused to allow us to follow him. The honorable senator started the amendment and abandoned the principle. As the amendment and the principle were so inextricably mixed that they could not be separated, both motion and principle were abandoned in the same act. I only rise to say, however, that I have not abandoned the principle in the slightest degree ; that in spite of the dissent of the various honorable senators who spoke on my side and voted on the other- </para>

Although that might seem to amount to a general disavowal of the parliamentary principle which governs us, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I abandon no particle of the principles I have contended for to-day. I say we have' a perfect right to amend this clause, and that the deduction ought not to be made, because of the disaffection of any portion of the committee from the views which they originally advocated, that we are sacrificing the principle. It has been shown that we can amend-- </para>

                        <para>- Well, say, a full report. The Auditor-General, however, might leave out of his general report a large number of suggestions and submit them in a special report, which would only go to the Treasurer. It would not go to both Houses of Parliament. If it is well that the Auditor-General should forward his general report to Parliament, is it not equally desirable that he should send his special report to each House of Parliament ? I submit that the reason given for providing that the one report shall go before Parliament applies equally to the other. The Auditor-General might make his suggestions in the annual report, and then they would come before Parliament. He might say that instead of making his suggestion in the annual report he will make it in a special report, and Parliament will not be entitled to see that unless the Treasurer sees fit. That surely was never the intention. Again, clause 12 says - </para>

                        <para>- I think with regard to the first part of clause 54 it is really all included under clause 12, which covers a tremendous lot of ground. What is really indicated under clause 54 is that any suggestions which may be made by the Auditor-General with regard te the better collection or payment of public money may refer to any of those things contained in the annual report or special report, and shall be considered and dealt with by the Governor-General. That I take to be the enacting part of the clause. If it were (is the honorable and learned senator suggests, clause 53 would contradict clause 12, which we have already passed. It would mean then that every special report that the Auditor-General made, and any communication he desired to make with regard to these matters, should all be laid before Parliament. The subjects referred to under clause 1 2 pretty well cover all the subjects, referred to under clause 54. Clause 12 says that the Auditor-General may communicate upon certain matters with the Treasurer, and it is now suggested that we should enlarge that, and provide that every report that is made by the Auditor-General to the Treasurer shall also be laid upon the table. Of course if there is any important matter, there is no doubt whatever that it will be embodied in the annual report to Parliament, but the Auditor-General might be allowed to communicate with the Treasurer and make suggestions to him from time to time as to a better method of collection, or it might be with regard to some particular improvements he desires to suggest in the collection or payment of money in some obscure part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know where the honorable senator would draw the line. Clause 1.2 says the Auditor-General may communicate with the Treasurer at anytime, and I presume his communications would be special reports ; and then there is the annual report that deals with the whole of the finances of the Commonwealth, and that must be submitted to Parliament. I think, for purposes of the kind I have indicated, it would be sufficient to allow the Auditor-General to communicate as proposed in the Bill with the Treasurer. This clause 54 provides that any plans or suggestions he makes with regard to these matters must be considered bv the Governor-General, which of course means that any suggestions he makes to the Treasurer come before the Cabinet for consideration. </para>

                    <para>- I am inclined to support the Postmaster-General's contention. I do not think the Treasurer could defeat the purpose of the Auditor-General on any important point, because if the Auditor-General had any important recommendation to make, he would take care to include it in his annual report to Parliament. This clause would not give the Treasurer power to defeat the purpose of the Auditor-General, and at the same time I can quite understand that it might be necessary many times during the course of the year for the Auditor-General to make some suggestion or recommendation to the Treasurer. </para>

                        <para>- Only for five years. We take so much of the debt, and we pay the interest ourselves upon the debt we take over. The States will have nothing to do with" it at all. There is evidently some confusion in the minds of some persons about this. If honorable senators will look over the clause carefully they will see that if we take over the State debt it will be for the Commonwealth to pay interest, and we will charge it to the portion of the financial year to which it belongs. Otherwise we shall have two systems of paying the interest in the Common wealth. </para>

                    <para>- I rise to support the omission of these words, and I do so on behalf of sound and honest finance. It is not at all a reasonable thing that a debt belonging to one quarter or half-year should be carried over to the next quarter or half-year. It is a system which would not be allowed or thought of in any private business, in any bank, or large institution. And it is calculated to give an entirely wrong impression of the position of the State. Moreover, some difficulty, it will be seen, arises from the fact that the practice in the States is not uniform. There are States in which the practice only concerns a quarter, and others in which it concerns a half-year. I 'am not quite sure whether the practice is current in the whole of the States. </para>

                        <para>- If it were not it I would be an improvement in the clause, but as I read it it compels the whole of the items which are charged on the first of the current quarter to be carried on instead of being charged back to the quarter or period when they actually matured. Supposing that £10,000,000 *' be taken over, the interest on that sua* for a quarter comes to £75,000, or for six. months to £150,000. All that is necessary is for the State, instead of taking over simply £10,000,000, to take over £10,150,000, and that will at once put the finances of the State and of the Commonwealth on a. fair, sound, and proper basis. There will be no deception. Everybody will see exactly how the account stands. </para>

                        <para>- Their revenue does not need assisting. All we want to do is to put the accounts in a fair position, and to let all the world know how they really do stand. If at the end of a second period a certain sum is due, let all the world know it is due. Do not let the accounts of the period close and it be understood that the State has paid its indebtedness in that quarter when a large sum is handed over to the next quarter. Tt is very bad finance, and the finance of many of the States is not conducted in the manner in which it ought to be, and it would be very desirable, I think, for us to try to lead all the States aright in this matter. There will be no difficulty with the States, because the matter is easily arranged in the way I have spoken of. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether the Commonwealth would have power to do that. In fact I am not quite sure whether it is within its power to purchase the stock in that way- by taking it up and giving, cash for it. I want to show how it may embarrass the State. Supposing that £10,000,000 were taken over at 3 percent., the interest will be £75,000 for a quarter. The accounts of that State will already be debited with £75,000 for that quarter, for the interest that accrued due in the previous quarter. When the loan is taken over the Commonwealth Government, following the line of its own Audit Act, debits the same quarter with another £75,000 for the interest accrued due during that quarter, which will mean that the interest, instead of being charged with the £75,000 during that quarter as previously, will be charged with £150,000. </para>

                        <para>- Let it be borne in mind that those States who have financed so as to put off their quarter's or half-year's interest to the next period, have very often gone through times of great difficulty and trial. They must have had great difficulty in financing, and they have been led to adopt this particular method of making their finances a little better than they would have been otherwise. We in the Commonwealth have had no trials of that sort. We are starting with a clean sheet. With revenue in excess of expenditure, but under no temptation to finance in that way, have we a right to take up this position - " AVe- shall keep our books all right from the start. AVe shall adopt a proper system of finance, and charge to each quarter and each half year the interest which becomes due during that time, and we shall force the States to do the same thing." I think it will be better, especially at this stage, for us not to take that step. Let us say that we hope that the States will see their way to adopt the system of bookkeeping which we propose to start with, but in the meantime we leave it to their own good sense and judgment to make the change as soon as they conveniently can. </para>
