                    <para>- A great weakness in the operation of the provision in the Queensland Public Service Act has been that the commissioners, instead of making personal visits, merely issued a circular to the heads of departments, and to the officers in charge of various branches, requesting answers to be supplied to certain questions. I am glad to observe that this clause provides for personal inspection. I hope that there will be a vigorous inspection of the departments within a reasonable time by the inspectors. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- The remarks of
                    seem to me to carry a kind of vote of censure against every chief officer in the States. We can find instances of failure of justice wherever we look - from the woolsack downwards. To make a charge of that sort against the chief officers in the States is, I think, a very great mistake.
                    has failed to grasp the facts as they exist. The facts are that all the civil servants have been graded, not by the chief officers, as I desire, but by the Public Service Boards in which he has such confidence. I ask, taking all the services of the States and having them properly graded, how are they to be classified into one service ? If there are six inspectors - one to each State - or, as I hope will be the case, three inspectors - one to every two States - how is the classification to be arrived at unless the inspectors personally examine the officers and then confer together, compare notes, make recommendations, and suggest a classification? I wonder that the Postmaster-General does not see the point. But if the Government are content to let the classification of the public service be done in this unpractical and impossible way, I must submit.

                        <para>- Under other clauses a report is required from the permanent head of the department, but there is this difference - that in the clause we are now dealing with, several departments are affected. Clause S provides that officers may be transferred from one department to another. Therefore it may be necessary for those who work with the commissioner to have a report not from one permanent head, but from the permanent heads of several departments. Those reports might be contradictory. If it is suggested that instead of a report from the permanent head, a report from the chief officer should be obtained, I think that is entirely out of the question, because it would put the permanent head into a most invidious position. It would be asking a subordinate officer to report to the commissioner over the head of the permanent head. The inspector himself would be reporting on the chief officer, and the chief officer also would be sending a report to the commissioner. That is the reason why, in this clause, no reference is made to the report of the permanent head. </para>

                        <para>- Probably for the reason that this deals with the organization of the whole service, and not, with one department only, and also because it does not deal with the officers of any one State, but with the officers throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore, it seems neither necessary nor desirable that any provision should be made for the consideration of a report from the permanent head of one department. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - One of the objections I have to this Bill is that the permanent heads and chief officers are placed in a humiliating position under it. The heads of departments are charged with the control, discipline, and management of their departments, but almost the whole of the power is given into the hands of the commissioner. I hold in my hand four articles which appeared in a newspaper in Western Australia when the Public Service Bill was before Parliament in that State. I believe the effect of the publication of these articles was to change the control of the public service of that State from a board back to Ministerial responsibility. These articles were written by an old Victorian civil servant. One of them says -

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - If we are going to exclude the chief officers from all right of control and from the opportunity to give advice, we might very well characterize this measure as one for the propagation of " pimps. I say that deliberately, because I know what has happened in connexion with this method of sending round persons to make inquiries, and of classifying as the result of those inquiries. The man most likely to play informer is closeted with the inspecting officers, who pump from him all the tittle tattle that can be obtained in connexion with the different officers employed in his division. As the result of- this behind-the^ back tittle-tattle, the classification takes place, and the permanent heads have no say in the settlement of these important questions. As I understand this Bill, the scheme of it is that the Governor-General shall be the apex of everything. To him on one side the commissioner reports, and on the other side the Minister reports. 'Die heads of departments report to the Minister, and the inspectors report to the commissioner. Beginning at the base, we have on the one hand the inspectors reporting to the commissioner, and the com missioner to the Governor-General ; and on the opposite side the chief officers reporting to the Minister, and the Minister to the Governor-General. If we want to increase expense to the Commonwealth, and have an inordinately large number of important officials, who shall by tins very process be battering their heads one against the other, wasting their time and the public money, we shall succeed, most admirably under this system. What is the use of the Minister when he is superior to the commissioner in one respect, and inferior to him in another ? Under this system, instead of having a proper administration beginning at the beginning, we shall have nothing but conflict till we get to the Governor- General .

                        <para>- If the honorable senator will look at paragraph (tf), he will find that an inspector is required to furnish in writing to the commissioner a full report as to every inspection, examination or inquiry, including therein recommendations for the consideration- and determination of the commissioner. That, no doubt, includes appointments, but it includes a great deal more. It includes every detail upon which it may be the duty of an inspector to report. I have had some experience in these matters, as I was, for some little time, a member of the old Civil Service Board of New South Wales. I never was an official, and never had a relative who was an official ; and what I know of these matters has been gained from positions occupied, so to speak, outside the service. I have no official prejudices, but I think that great care should be taken to preserve the authority of those who are responsible. Under this Bill the chief officers will be charged with the responsibility. If the inspectors make wrong reports, and the commissioner comes to wrong conclusions as the result  of the hearsay evidence upon which he will act, the person held responsible, if anything goes wrong, will be the chief officer, who, under the Bill, can do nothing. It will be my duty to take a division upon the question, though I may be in a minority. </para>

                    <para>- We have so far provided for the arrangement of the whole of the service, and it is evidently anticipated that there may be cases in which there will be officers in excess of the demand in any department or in the service of the Commonwealth as a whole, and the question arises as to how the excess of officers is to be dealt with. That is provided for in this sub-clause. It is absolutely necessary to have such a power. We have to bear in mind that there are two classes of officers in the service, permanent officers, under a system of promotion, and also what are called officers under temporary appointment. In some States more than in others, and in some departments more than in others, there is a considerable number of officers temporarily employed. The retention for years of so-called temporarily appointed officers is a curse to the public service. I know of cases where men have been temporarily employed for six, seven, and eight years. I know of as many as eight or nine nien being so employed in one department. It was this system which caused the break-down of the public service in 1 884. I do not think any honorable senator will deny that where two officers are discharging similar work, and one of them has to go, it should be the temporary employe. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I submit that that is the whole point. I think that the merit of each case should be considered, and that if there is an excess officer the commissioner should consider whether it is desirable that the permanent man or the temporary man should go. It would be fair for the commissioner to take into consideration the length- of service of the men, and not keep a man who had secured permanent employment within the last year or two in preference to a man who had been temporarily employed for double the time. Another matter which should be taken into consideration is the convenience of the department to which the officer belongs. So long as employment can be found for him in a department, I do not think that any officer, temporary or permanent, should be put out to make way for officers from any other department, or from any other State. </para>

                    <para>- It sounds very fair, and very reasonable, that a man who is said to be a permanent officer should not go if there is a temporary officer in the department ; but we have to look at the case of States, where a pro and tem. service has been adopted as a part of the civil service. In South Australia, we have a pro and tem. list and a fixed list. Many officers who have been on the pro and tem. list for ten or twenty years are quite as much civil servants, and as deserving of consideration, as those who happen to be on the fixed list. In our original Civil Service Act, we divided the civil service into classes, and we provided for a considerable difference between the classes. In </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>One class, a cadet who started at £25 went up to £80, and when he rose to £90 he passed into another class, in which he received an annual increase of £10 until he rose to £ 150. When he had got to the top of that class, he and his friends naturally fought very hard to get him into the lowest grade of the next class, so that he might rise by an annual increase of £10 from £150 to £210. A man might be worth £180 who would not be worth £210. We found that we were paying men on the fixed list, very frequently, considerably more than their services were worth. Their services might be worth more than the minimum of a class, but certainly not worth the maximum. Therefore we adopted the system of appointing a number of pro and tem. officers, so that we should pay civil servants only the value of their services. The Government did not think it worth while to trouble about altering the Act. In the Post-office and the Customs department the vast majority of the civil servants are on the pro and tem. list. Possibly in other States such a system has not been adopted. Through force of circumstances, we adopted the expedient of appointing officers right and left on the pro and tem. list - men who in many cases had passed the ordinary civil service examination and entered at the lower rung of the ladder, and whose salaries were gradually increased by Parliament when it was thought that an increase was deserved, without reference to the Civil Service Act. These pro and tem. men were protected under the Act. After they had served five years they were entitled to practically all the privileges of an ordinary civil servant - for instance, to a retiring allowance and to leave of absence. Under this amendment we should have men coming over from a neighbouring State to take the place of men in our Post-office or Customs department, who are called temporary, but who are really permanent employes. Where the circumstances have differed so much in the States, and various practices have been adopted, we must look at each case on its merits quite apart from the question of whether an officer is on the fixed list, or the pro and tem. list. I believe that the commissioner will take length of service into consideration and not trouble his head much as to whether a man is a permanent or temporary employe. </para>

The officers who have been called pro. and tem. appear to me to be permanent officers who have been appointed under the Act. They are not what we understand as temporary officers in Victoria - namely, men appointed for a period of not more than six months. My amendment would certainly not act fairly toward such men, and under the circumstances I ask leave to withdraw it.

But we have evidence from South Australia and New South Wales that men who have served twenty years are still called temporary officers. In my opinion temporary officers ought to retire before permanent officers. If, on the merits of each case, a pro and tem. officer is really a permanent officer he ought to be made permanent.

                    <para>- The word " determine " is inconsistent with the previous clause, which says that the Governor-General is to determine. In suggesting an amendment, I am placed at a very great disadvantage on account of the very loose language of the previous clause. It does not say plainly what we all mean - that the commissioner is to suggest the classification, and the Governor-General is to finally determine it. If the Chairman had not, with his desire to get the Bill put through quickly - which, I am sure, we all applaud - put the question so hurriedly; I should have proposed an amendment to the effect that the Governor-General should deal with and finally determine the classification. The amendment I wish now to propose is to the effect that the commissioner shall keep a record. The whole fight in the other House was in regard to giving over the management of the civil service to an outside commissioner, but at the same time maintaining the responsibility of the Governor-General. If we allow the Governor-General to finally determine the classification proposed by the commissioner it is all right, but if we say that the commissioner himself shall determine the classification we undo the work which has already been done in clause 8. Therefore we should say that the commissioner shall keep a record of the officers as classified by . the Governor-General, or whose classification has been' finally dealt with under the proposed clause.

I strongly object to any limitation of the power of the commissioner; but at the same time I recognise that throughout the Bill he merely has to recommend, and the final approval must rest with the Governor-General. </para>

                    <para>- I take the view, that it would be very dangerous indeed to give the commissioner supreme power in the determination of the division and class of each officer. It would create a panic in the civil service, unless the commissioner were recognised as a very high-minded and just man. I will support any amendment that will subject the determination of the commissioner to the final control of the Governor-General, which of course means the Executive Council. I do not object to the commissioner having a hand in it, but to give him. the final determination would be very wrong indeed. </para>

                    <para>- I must admit that I do not like the word " determine " myself, because clause 9 clearly applies to every officer. I have not the slightest doubt that the commissioner will be the person who will fix and decide upon the class and grade of officers. Of course he must do so, always subject to a control of the Governor-General. The previous clause refers to officers who have been in the service previous to the passing of this measure, but this clause is clearly designed to correct anomalies and to put officers who are in the service in their proper places. If the service in any particular State has not been worked well, the inspector makes his report in regard to the particular department together with a recommendation. The commissioner may then propose certain changes or alterations under clause 8. It is perfectly clear that the commissioner is bound to respect the decision given by </para>

Under the Customs Act a similar power is given, but it only relates to the State in which the inspector may be. This clause will give the inspector power to summon a man from Western. Australia to Victoria. That cannot be intended, but, inasmuch as there is a restriction under the Customs Act, it seems to me that there should be a similar one here. I do not move an amendment but suggest the necessity for one.

                    <para>- During the debate on the second reading of the Bill, some honorable senators, with myself, had a little altercation with the Postmaster-General as to the powers given to the permanent heads. The Postmaster-General stated that there were many instances under the Bill in which the permanent heads had power and authority, but I could not find them. If there is any part in which the permanent heads should be introduced it is that dealing with the fixing of salaries. The chief officer should know a great deal about the value of the services of the officers who have worked under him for many years, and I ask the Postmaster-General to consent to give the permanent heads some power in this matter. If honorable senators will look at clause 27 they will find that, if some person from without the service is proposed for appointment, the appointment is to be made by the Governor-General on recommendation by the commissioner and upon a report from the permanent head. </para>

                    (Queensland). - The Postmaster-General has urged that it would be a great hardship to a number of young ! deserving men if women were employed at clerical work in equal proportion to men. Is there no hardship to young deserving women in the present condition of things
                    Except in Victoria, Western Australia, and Queensland, the sexes are, I think, in equal proportions in the Commonwealth. Where would the hardship come in under my amendment? Women are not supposed by some honorable senators to eat and drink and lodge in comfortable places, and wear decent clothes, but it is the young men who are supposed to deserve these conditions. My daughters have to live, just as well as my sons, and if there is a section of the community which deserves special consideration it is the young women, who are not able to protect themselves in the same way as young men can do. It is a poor argument to advance that if women were employed it would be a great hardship to a number of young men. Young men can find employment in various avenues which are closed to women. In the railway service of Victoria, employing 10,000 men, how many women are employed ? Very few in comparison with the vast number of men. In Queensland, bow many women are employed in the railway service? A couple of hundred.

                        <para>- It is not. I do not contend that in all the departments women would be capable of filling the various positions, but I do hold that if there is work for which women are eminently fitted, physically and mentally, it is clerical work. I have some notes with regard to the number- of persons employed in different branches of industry. If the committee will not agree with my amendment I hope they will consider it, and not treat it with levity and laughter. It should be discussed in a rational way. </para>

In English speaking countries the status of women has been raised greatly during the last 50 years, and is still being raised. I admit that there is plenty of room for improvement, but there is no necessity for inserting this provision in the Bill, and I shall oppose it. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I am sure that my honorable friend
                    is perfectly sincere in the view of this matter which he has expressed, but, at the same time, I think he is mistaken. I know of no better guide for the future than what has occurred in the past; and if we judge as to how the sexes are to be employed in the future by what has happened in the past, there will not be much show for the females. Let me direct attention to a few figures. In New South Wales the Commonwealth Government employs nearly 4,000persons in connexion with branches of the service taken over from the State. The number of females employed is only 219. Is that a fair proportion? In Victoria, the Commonwealth Government employs 2,764 civil servants, of whom only 390 are females. In Queensland there are 1,288 persons employed, of whom only 45 are females. In the model State of South Australia, I find that of a total of 1,232 persons employed in the Commonwealth service there are only 127 females.
                    will admit that the officials who have the employment of women will continue to be of the same class, and there is not much chance that they will, in the future, make a larger selection of females. In Tasmania, of 559 persons employed in the Commonwealth service, there are 101 women, the largest percentage in any of the States. In Western Australia there are 1,422 persons employed in the Commonwealth service, and 217 of them are females. If
                    anticipates that a larger proportion of females will be employed in the departments in the future he is likely to be woefully disappointed, and it would be much better if the honorable senator would assist me in taking this step, which would, at any rate, guarantee the employment of a greater number of women in the future. Now, let us take a few of the industries which are entirely closed to women. Take mining, for instance. I should be sorry to see women employed in mines, though in my young days, in Scotland, I saw women working at the pit banks. In the Commonwealth t here are 83,000 miners, and 20,000 men employed in occupations connected with mining, or over 100,000 men ; and that avenue of employment is entirely and properly closed to women. Then the foundries, chemical works, tanneries, and iron works are all closed to women. Surely it is not too much to ask that this clerical division of the service shall be open to women.

                        <para>- There are only 127 employed now in the Commonwealth service in that State, and there are very few employed in the State service. It is often said that if women are employed they will throw men out of work ; but the fact that if men are employed exclusively women must be thrown out of work is never taken into account. Viewing it from every possible stand-point, I think that this is a fair proposal. It is sometimes contended that if we offer increased facilities for employment to women they will be prevented from marrying. In a very great many instances it would be a good thing if they were. Tens of thousands of women marry merely for a home, and as a consequence tens of thousands of marriages are mistakes. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt a girl brought up in a good domestic home with some degree of refinement will make an excellent wife for a working man but I entirely dissent from the view that factory girls make bad wives. I worked myself in a factory and amongst factory girls. I married a factory girl, and no better woman or better mother ever breathed. There are tens of thousands of factory girls who would make splendid wives and heads of households. It does not follow that because a girl works in a factory she is necessarily unadapted to preside over a home. It may be done unconsciously, as it is likely to be on this occasion, but by curtailing the opportunities for the employment of women they are driven in thousands of instances to forced marriages which lead to infinite mischief and to no end of strife, difficulty, hardship, and privation through life. If we endeavour to find openings for the employment of women, and to place them in such a position that they will be able to earn their own livelihood, they will be independent, and they will be less likely to make an unfortunate choice than they are under existing circumstances. I say that in the performance of clerical duties women are equal, and in many instances superior, to men. I do not wish to put them on a superior pedestal, but I know that in the United States of America women are employed in every possible direction. I have seen them in printing offices there standing at the same frames with men, doing the same work, and receiving the same pay for it. I have seen them employed in hundreds of instances in the departments at Washington, and I know that in one of the departments a lady was the chief officer, and was receiving £700 a year. I deny that, so far as clerical work is concerned, women are unable to perform the duty as well as men. </para>

                    (Western Australia).This is one of those questions upon which I think it is not wise to give a silent vote, lest it might be misinterpreted. I claim to have as much sympathy with women workers as
                    but I recognise the impracticability of this proposal. I wish to see women treated in the same way as men in the public service, and I certainly wish to see them paid equally well for similar services.

                    <para>- There are one or two points which have been somewhat overlooked. The amendment is restricted to the clerical division, and it refers only to new appointments. We have a fully-manned civil service, and therefore the number of women who might be appointed under this amendment would be very few. It is only proposed that women shall be appointed when the positions to be filled are suitable to their employment. If such an amendment is not made, although we have undoubted testimony that women are equally as good as men for certain offices in the public service, still they may be debarred from employment by prejudice. For this reason I support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The wives and daughters of the larger proportion of our householders have to do their own domestic work. I am not afraid of restricting the area from which the ranks of domestic servants can be recruited. The conditions of life for domestic servants have been much improved ; but until very recently in many households they were looked upon as very inferior beings. They were very little more to be considered than the watch-dogs of the household. I am glad to say that our experience is showing us that that condition of things is improving, and I think it will go on improving if we throw open to the young women of Australia as many avenues of employment as we can. The amendment does not tie the hands of the Postmaster-General greatly it simply gives to him and the head of the department a mandate from Parliament, that as nearly as may be and wherever practicable, there shall be in the clerical division an equal number of women employed as of men. I hope the amendment will be carried, because, while it cannot do harm, it may do good. </para>
