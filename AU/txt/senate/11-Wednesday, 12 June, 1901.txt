                            <para>- Well, I will add to it then. I have given Notice of Motion this afternoon relating to two Bills which it is proposed to introduce to-morrow. There is another Bill which under ordinary circumstances would have been introduced at the same time, but has been delayed. I hope that very shortly that other Bill will be laid on the table of the Senate. 1 may remind the Senate that there is every probability that the other House will be engaged at some later period of the session in the discussion of a measure which will not only be of great importance, but will involve a great deal of detail. That House, therefore, will probably be fully occupied during that time, and it has been considered desirable that measures should be introduced first in the other House, in order that when that period arrives there will be plenty of work for the Senate to go on with. I assure the Senate that every effort will be made to arrange the business in such a way that both Houses will be fully occupied the whole of this session. </para>

                        <para>- Under the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia which we have adopted temporarily, a motion for adjournment to bring on some matter which cannot be brought on in the ordinary manner must be moved before the business is called on at all. It must be moved before the questions have been called on, and in the form that the Senate at its rising adjourn to some unusual day or to some unusual hour, and it can only be moved to bring forward a matter of pressing public importance. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps I may be permitted to say a word in regard to the matter, as it appertains to the privileges of the Senate. What I understand is that the honorable senator was desirous of directing attention to something which had been said, or which is reported to have been said, since the last meeting of the Senate, and as this is the first meeting which has been held since the alleged statement was made, he desires to make a complaint about its character. It will be perfectly clear that, in a case like that, it was impossible for the honerable senator to have given any notice in the ordinary sense ; and with all due respect to your ruling, sir, would not the first meeting of the Senate, after a statement had been made, be the proper time and the immediate time to introduce a question of this character ? If an honorable senator has to give notice, it is a different thing altogether. Supposing the thing had happened five minutes ago, as this is the first opportunity he has had since last Thursday to bring it forward, would he not be in practically the same position if he proposed to bring it forward on the ground that it affected either the privileges of the Senate or the privileges of any individual senator ? </para>

                        <para>- Yes, that prevents the erection of suitable buildings. Sometimes if a man is very pertinacious he will get a great deal more money spent on. a post-office than the town is entitled to. I do not want to pull the thing down to the bare matter of postal sufficiency, but I want to see buildings erected which will be a credit to the towns and districts. Of course, a town with 2,000 inhabitants cannot expect to have a post-office that would suit a town of 20,000 or 30,000 inhabitants, but I do not want all beautification to be done away with in consequence of the transference of the department from the State Government to the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; in many places that is done at the present time. I do not mean to say that where you haven handful of people you 'should put up an expensive building. The probability is that the work could be done in some other premises, but where a building is erected it should be erected on fair and reasonable lines, and be fairly architecturally beautiful and pleasant to look upon. Another question raised by the Postmaster-General is whether postal buildings ought to be erected out of revenue or loans. All I can say is that if we are only going to erect our postal buildings out of revenue, it will be a very long time before the requirements of the country are properly attended to. In cases where buildings are to be of a permanent character, it is a very reasonable thing that the money should be raised by loan, and it is equally reasonable that provision should be made for a sinking fund, by means of which those loans may be paid off before the buildings are obliterated. </para>

                        <para>- Parliament, of course, is all powerful. If Parliament chooses to authorize an expenditure of £50,000 to put up postal buildings in places with a population of 5,000 it can do so ; but it is not likely to be such an ass. I hope not, at any rate. </para>

                            <para>- The effect of the clause is to infringe a well known rule. The accuser is placed not in the- position of a generous accuser, to let the accused person off, but in the position of a Judge, to determine the question and to inflict a line, as though he were sitting in a court. It would be a better and a wider power, I think, to allow the Postmaster-General to abstain from prosecuting in minor cases, but with a discretion to abandon proceedings upon such terms as he might think fit. These, it seems to me, are the most important parts of the Bill itself which may possibly be open to discussion. Nearly all the other clauses are inserted with the object of consolidating the measures in force in the various States, selecting, as I believe, the very best from the mass. The sooner, for the benefit of the postal and telegraphic departments, we get them embodied in law, the better it will be for the conduct of the service. </para>

                            <para>- But they become law before they are laid before Parliament. That is the point upon which I desire to address this Senate. Those who represent the gold-fields of Western Australia have had some experience in this matter. The Gold-fields Act of Western Australia provided, just as this Bill does, that the by-laws and regulations under that Act should have the force of law, and consequently it handed over, in all questions in which it was impossible to frame regulations, the power to Ministers to legislate practically behind the back of Parliament. What happened ? While Parliament was not sitting, the Ministry brought in the notorious 10-ft. regulation, which deprived thousands of people "of the means of earning their livelihood. It was legislation in the fullest sense of the term. Under clauses 19 and 91 of this Bill it is provided that the power of fixing fees for the carriage of letters, the power of deciding the very vital principle of whether newspapers should be carried free or not, and if not the amount to be imposed should be left to the sweet will of the Governor-General in Council, acting under the advice of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                            <para>- I am not arguing what any Government would be wise or unwise enough to do. I am considering legally the effect pf what we are doing. I have no doubt that the Postmaster-General is a wise and discreet man, and will act as such, but I hold that we as a Legislature have no right to assume that our Postmaster-General is everything he ought to be. This legislative power is intrusted to us, but is not intrusted to us to be delegated to somebody else. I think we should take the responsibility of our action, and that it should not be handed over to the Postmaster-General to do just as he thinks desirable. If regulations are to have the force of law immediately they are gazetted, then, in my humble opinion, they should only be formal regulations for the purpose of working the department, and not in any way connected with a vital principle, such as the amount which is to be charged for postage in the Commonwealth. Nor should they deal with the question of whether the newspapers of the Commonwealth should be carried free or whether they should not. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing the effect of the action of the Minister. I am discussing the principle which underlies this clause giving the Minister power to frame regulations which have the force of law whether Parliament approves of them or whether it does not. I come from a State where the consequence of this provision has been evidenced, and all the representatives from Western Australia will join with me when I say that it almost revolutionized that State. When we have had an experience of that kind, surely it is desirable to see that the principle - and it is the principle I am now combating more than anything else - is not introduced into one of the first Bills that the Commonwealth Parliament has to deal with. </para>

Why should there be differential rates for telegrams from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Cape Chance or any other point one likes to name? If I send a telegram from one State to another, there is a differential rate, although it may be a shorter distance than to Port Darwin. If I send a telegram from Adelaide to Port Darwin, I presume the rate is the minimum rate of South Australia; whereas, if I send a telegram from here to Port Darwin, although it is the same distance, I pay double or treble the rate. </para>

The Commonwealth should be divided into districts, and there should be an inspector for each district, who would, of course, emulate the inspector in the adjoining district and in the other districts. By that means we would get full advantage of the system, and it would be better than following the old hard-and-fast rule of having six deputy postmasters-general. I know the Deputy Postmasters-General are very able and capable men. I am not saying a word against them. I am not speaking in that direction at all. </para>

                            <para>- Nature is irrevocable. I am dealing with principles, and not with jocular matters. The rates for telegrams should be fixed by zones, or distances, so that business men would not be at the mercy of regulations. I am not at all afraid that the Postmaster-General will do anything wrong. But it would be far better to fix the rates in a schedule than by a regulation, because a regulation becomes law immediately it is gazetted. Private telephone lines are being established all over Australia, and if the present rates were raised the charge would be too heavy, so that men would have to give them up. There is a good deal of difficulty thrown in the way of private telephone lines crossing roads. I may desire to put a line under the earth in such a way that there will be no possibility of danger to it, but there are all sorts of difficulties and red-tape created by the department. I have had some trouble in regard to this matter, so that I know a good deal about it. I hope that in this Bill all sorts of useless and needless red-tape will be done away with. I again congratulate the Minister on the very lucid speech he made in regard to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I doubt that. If there is a uniform system I think the Minister will take care that there is no undue influence. He will be willing to call for tenders, say, for a horse service if it would be ample for all requirements. If representations were made to him, however, he might call for alternative tenders for a horse ' and a bus service, and if the State desires the latter, charge the difference to it. 1 think the thing could be easily managed in that way. With reference to the erection of post-offices, my own idea is that in a great many instances, especially where there is a doubt as to whether the settlement is likely to be permanent, the Postmaster-General will have to be careful in his initial expenditure. When, however, a township is seen to be growing, and there is every prospect of it succeeding, the Postmaster-General should not be too niggardly in the amount he grants for the erection of suitable buildings. It would be wise, on the ground of economy, that he should go a little beyond present requirements. He should anticipate the growth of a township, and if he puts up a post-office, it should, at all events, be a decent one. This is a machinery Bill, and with the exception of the points I have mentioned, I do not see that there is anything to which exception can be taken. I shall, therefore, be pleased to assist the Government in its passage. </para>

                        <para>- I agree with what has fallen from a number of senators as to our indebtedness to the Postmaster-General for his splendid exposition of the principles of this Bill, and also for the way in which he indicated the lines of policy that would guide him in connexion with the administration of the' Postal department. I cannot help thinking that he rather laid too much emphasis upon the commercial aspect of the measure. He has got to remember, as I am sure he does, that we have here a vast undeveloped continent, and that we have a duty to render to those who do not crowd themselves into cities. We ought to offer them every possible facility, with the view of making their lives as agreeable as possible. That is a general principle I am sure we will all bear in mind. We cannot afford to disregard the commercial aspects of the matter, yet we have to remember the indirect advantages which may follow from offering facilities, so far as postal services are concerned, rather than to consider the immediate return likely to accrue. Now, while it is desirable that we should have ornamental post-offices in important townships, yet I am sure every senator will realize that efficiency and comprehensiveness in the postal service should be the first consideration. No doubt when settlement is undoubted and the conditions of a township warrant the erection of an ornamental building in the shape of an architecturally beautiful post-office, the matter will receive due consideration. Now, in glancing through this Bill, I notice a number of important clauses which have been specially mentioned. Clause 16, which was mentioned in particular, is one that I have looked at, and which I venture to submit; with great respect, is not in the best form in which it might possibly be put. It says : - </para>

                            <para>- Will the honorable senator allow me ? As far as our railways are concerned, I am pointing out the particular section of the Constitution Act which deals with their control in respect to transport for naval and military purposes. The Act deals also with the acquisition of the railways, and leaves that to be a matter of arrangement between the Commonwealth and the States. That indicates what our control of the railways is to be, and it is true that by sub-clause 39 of section 51, power is given to make laws in regard to matters vested by the Constitution in the Parliament. I submit for the consideration of the Postmaster-General, whether it is absolutely clear that the Commonwealth has power to enact a clause of this kind, and, if it has the power, whether it is desirable that the clause should be worded in this way. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator has hardly followed what I was urging. I was urging the constitutional power of Parliament to make an enactment of the kind. I agree with what has fallen from several honorable senators with regard to the fixing of the rates of postage by regulation. I do not think that we should fix our rates, as far as letters are concerned, by regulation. There are many subjects referred to in clauses 19 and 91 that are essentially matters for regulation ; but the question of postage rates, which so materially affects the interests of the Commonwealth,' should be a matter for the deliberation of Parliament rather than for regulation, which in every probability would escape the attention of nine-tenths of the members of this House and of another place. I. would also emphasize the view that has been stated, that these regulations have as a matter of form only to be put on the table of the Chamber. Now that is scarcely right, and as we are forming a precedent, the obligation on us is the greater to lay down some wholesome well-founded principles with regard to what form any delegation' of power by Parliament shall take. Regulations are practically delegations by Parliament enabling responsible Ministers to do certain executive acts. What I feel is that instead of these regulations, no matter what they are, being formally laid on the table, we should adopt some affirmative act. What I mean is that regulations should be confirmed by a resolution of the Senate, say within 14 or 30 days as the case might be, and should come into operation only after having been so confirmed. </para>

                            <para>- Of course there are plenty of precedents for regulations not coining into operation until they have received the sanction and approval of Parliament. I think the matter is well worth consideration. Now, there is another provision that has been mentioned, and that is clause 54, which refers to the enabling power taken by the Minister to prevent the delivery of letters. I am quite certain of this much, that in its design and object the clause is essentially in the public interest ; and I believe, moreover, that so far as four or five of the States are concerned, they have already laid down the principle that Parliament shall not be a party to offering facilities for gambling. The Parliaments of several of the States have been at all times careful that no public sanction shall be given to the pernicious system of gambling in any shape or form. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt, that is in force in some of the States, but in the State which I have the honour to represent, while we have plenty of gambling in our midst, while our biggest carnival partakes largely of that element, yet Parliament has been careful, as far as its public legislation is concerned, to avoid any sanction of the principle of gambling, and we have very rigid laws which neutralize its pernicious influence. </para>

                            <para>- That is the point I am arguing. There is another matter which has challenged the attention of honorable senators. Clauses 92 and 150 give power to the Minister to deal with certain offence!? which are not indictable offences. A similar provision exists in the Victorian Customs Act, and I can only say, after five and a half years' experience, that it has been found exceedingly useful. So long as the principle is followed, which I had the honour to rigidly observe during my term of office, namely, that every offence should be dealt with in public, and that every information should be given o the public in regard to these matters, it will prove a very valuable provision. The Customs Act contains some very rigid sections of this kind, and I do not mind saying no , v, after the event, that I found them specially useful in cases where, if I had attempted prosecutions, I should have had to overcome certain technical difficulties, and where the Government would have been obliged togo to serious expense and trouble in order to secure a conviction, although the person concerned admitted his guilt. </para>

                        <para>- I wish with other honorable senators to join in an expression of thanks to the honorable and learned gentleman in charge of this Bill for his lucid and comprehensive explanation of it. There are seven Tasmanian Acts which it is proposed to repeal by the Bill, and there are several clauses in it which are new to us. I quite agree with the Government that the Postal department should be conducted upon business lines and with due regard to economy. Such a proposition has my hearty approval. We ought to know the exact position of ; the Postal department more than that of any other department. The Postmaster-General told us the other day that he could not "tell whether there was an actual profit or loss, because so many works had been charged to capital which ought to have been charged to revenue. I would draw the attention of the honorable and learned senator in charge of the Bill to clause 36, sub-clause (2) of which provides that - </para>

                            <para>- When the Postmaster-General read it out on the first day, it occurred to me that the word " determine " was what made the difference. We know that in many Acts of Parliament power is given to the head officer of an institution to deal with offenders who plead guilty. That is quite right, because the head of the institution can say- - -"As the offence is admitted, all that remains is the apportionment of punishment ; and if the person is willing to rely on me, he may do so." That is a perfectly right thing, but it is quite another thing to enact that, although the person says - " I am not guilty," yet by his consent the Postmaster-General is to be elevated to the position of a Judge of one of the courts. It errs against the fundamental principle of criminal law, that no man shall be a judge in his own cause. </para>

                            <para>- It is worth £15,000- a year to Tasmania, but that sum represents a very great loss to the general community throughout Australia, from the fact that no less than a million of money I believe is. put every year into consultations. A. million of money is diverted from ordinary trade and commerce to a gambling institution, and in ten years that amount, goes into the pockets of the man who is running the consultation. Ten percent. I believe is the commission which he receives for carrying on the lottery. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I maintain that in cases of that kind it would be in the power of the Crown Law department not to take any action. I dare say the Crown Law department overlooks many cases of trivial offences, which if the law was carried out in its entirety would be brought before the courts. In fact, I have very grave suspicion that many high offenders against the law escape scot free on account of the power the Crown Law department possesses in that respect. I shall vote against that clause when it comes up, as I do not agree with the principle. With regard to the regulation of the rates of postage, I think there is a difficulty in the way of this Senate fixing the rates. We may spend a great deal of time in drawing up a schedule without very good result. I think we might almost as well ask that a Railway Commissioner, presuming that the railways were in our hands, should permit us to draw up the schedule of rates to be charged. But I do think we might have in the Bill a clause to provide that there shall be no alteration in the postal and telegraphic rates, except during the time Parliament is in session, and that the schedule should be placed on the table, and not become law for a certain period, in order that we may have a chance of reviewing the proposed rates. Why I think the Postmaster-General should be allowed to fix the rates is because he, with bis colleagues in the Cabinet, would be in a better position to judge of the revenue requirements of the department than we would be. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister will know that a very great deal of injustice is perpetrated by subletting. A man gets a contract at a reasonable price from the Government, and he sublets it to a contractor who sweats the men he employs. With regard to another important principle in connexion with the Postal department, I imagine from the Minister's remarks that it is proposed to charge for newspapers. Really I think that, too, shows a great amount of courage on the part of the Cabinet. I know that some State Governments have not had the pluck to face the matter, and the general taxpayer has had to bear a burden which should have been placed on the proper shoulders. I do hope, therefore, that the Minister means to impose a charge. It is not only an injustice to charge the general taxpayer with the carriage of newspapers free, but it is to some extent unfair to the newspapers which are printed in the country districts. I do not think there is anything more which I care to refer to just now. I join with others in congratulating the Minister on his very lucid introductory speech on the Bill which he has presented to us. I should say that an effort has been made to include all that is best in the various postal Acts of the various States, and that to my mind is a proof of the advantages of federation. </para>

I would suggest to the Minister that in Queensland we should have three Deputy Postmasters-General. Some honorable senators seem to be amused at my suggestion. </para>

                            <para>- It is in the interests of economy that I make the proposal. Queensland is a very large State, which nature has divided into three divisions, and my opinion is that the measure of. decentralization which I propose in connexion with the Post-office would be most advantageous to not only Queensland but also the entire Federation. I trust that the Min ister will take a note of my suggestion. With regard to the erection of new post-offices, my experience has been that a very large amount of money has been unnecessarily spent in the erection of more or less ornamental buildings. What we ought to direct our attention specially to is not ornamentation, but use. We are a young community, and in spite of what we hear about our great resources we are not a wealthy community. A very large proportion of our postal buildings have been erected out of loan money and not out of revenue, and I am exceedingly anxious that that system should not be continued. The Commonwealth should try to keep out of debt as much as possible, and the Post-office should be so managed that when new buildings are required revenue should be available for their construction. In Queensland we had a most curious method of dealing with the erection of new buildings. Some of them were erected out of loan account and some out of general revenue, and when I asked on one occasion how that came about the answer I received was that the cost of a brick building was defrayed out of loan account, but that the cost of a wooden building was charged to the general revenue. Whether the buildings are of wood or of brick I think the cost ought to be charged to the revenue: Another matter which I think the Minister might very well consider is the appointment of local storekeepers or persons in business in many of our outlying centres to manage the post office business. </para>

                            <para>- Our object is to extend postal facilities to as many as possible of the people of the Commonwealth. If we have to erect a post-office in every township and appoint a resident postmaster, the expense will be so great that we shall not be able to give the facilities which we otherwise could. But if we appoint local residents at small salaries - -because the duties in a great many places are merely nominal - we shall be able to extend the facilities by so much more. That system, I believe, is very largely followed in Great Britain, and 1 think it might be adopted more largely in Australia than it is. </para>

                            <para>- I think it is a very suitable occupation for women. There is only one objection I can think of, and it is that women are very often inquisitive, perhaps unduly inquisitive. I have read stories of individuals complaining that their letters had been opened where the person in charge of the post-office happened to be a lady. </para>

                            <para>- It may be a libel, I am merely giving it to honorable senators for what it is worth. I must cordially echo the objections to the power to make regulations, because I do not think that they should have the force of law until they have been submitted to and approved of by Parliament. By agreeing to the Bill as it stands, we are placing in the hands of the Government of the day the entire management of the Post-office - the fixing of the rates for letters and of the post ages on newspapers, and so forth. The men elected by the people desire to have some voice in the fixing of these rates. I am very glad to gather from the observations of the Prime Minister that he intends to charge postage on newspapers. He contended, very properly I think, that if newspapers, as is alleged, have an educational influence; the cost of their transit should be borne by the Education department. But, so far as I have been able to gather, newspapers are simply commercial enterprises ; they are not instituted to educate the people necessarily, but to make money. </para>

I believe in free postage when we can afford it, I believe in free railways when we can afford it, but if we are going to carry anything free let us begin with the necessaries of life. A great many persons look upon newspapers, I have no doubt, as necessaries, but a man can live without them. </para>

We want tea, sugar, and a number of other things, and when we have exhausted the necessaries of life, then we can go in for distributing the luxuries free. </para>

                            <para>- There is a good old maxim of English law, that every man shall be held to be innocent until he has been proved guilty, and I think it ought to be presumed that every newspaper is innocent of an offence against the law until it has been proved guilty. If sedition is charged against a writer on a newspaper, he ought to be brought ' before the court in the ordinary fashion, charged with his offence, and if found guilty punished. But to seize the newspaper, to stop the publication of it, appears to me to be contrary to the spirit of English law, and more in accordance with the custom in Russia. In fact, this clause places the Postmaster-General and his deputies in the position of censors. I do not think it is at all desirable that that should be the case. What he might think to be seditious thousands of persons in the State might have a different opinion about, and the place to settle a point of that sort is a court of justice. In regard to clause 54, which has been so belaboured by honorable gentlemen from all sides of the Senate, I am in a bit of a quandary. I may mention that I do not gamble, but I am not aware that I am entitled to very much credit for that. If some honorable senator will insure me that by speculating 5s. I can win £1,000, I shall gamble It any moment he likes and as often as! he pleases. But being a cautious and prudent Scotchman, 1 think 5s. in the hand is worth £1,000 in the bush, and very much in the bush. I do not see that I am entitled to interfere with other people who more speculative, who are more daring, who are more ambitious, perhaps, to get money than I am. Why, sir, speculation is the life and soul of business. If there was no speculation there would be no profits, and this special form of gambling which seems to have so aroused the ire of people in the States that they have exhausted every resort to suppress it, is only one of a hundred forms of gambling. There is no honorable1 senator who does not gamble in one shape or another. The buying of an allotment of land is gambling, yet they call it speculation. </para>

The law has a certain amount of control over it, and as I have said, if we suppress it in one way, the conductors of the enterprise and the public will only have recourse to methods of evasion and subterfuge, and it will go on in the future just as it has done in the past. Seeing that gambling is a weakness of humanity, why do we not turn it to account and get some revenue out of it ? Smoking tobacco is a weakness, but look how the Government pounce down on the tobacco smoker, and make him pay for indulging in his little luxurious habit. Whisky drinking is a weakness, and the whisky drinker has to pay handsomely for his indulgence i f people will persist in putting their money into speculations of this character let the Government have some benefit by it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not go to the length of advocating a State lottery, but if we are to have lotteries I do not see why the State should not run them. The State runs a great many things more immoral to my mind than lotteries. Now, there is another matter I would like to refer to, and that is the employment of coloured seamen on mail-ships. I think I read somewhere recently that it was not proper to put a provision of that character in the Bill - that it was usually reserved for the contract. I would like to see it in the Bill, but of course we may be told that the Imperial Government would not consent to it. I think the sooner we let the Imperial Government know that we are going to be masters within the confines of Australia the better. This question has to be settled sooner or later, and the sooner the better. </para>

                            <para>- If they have got it they have not paid for it, but that will come in due course, and in due course the past office properties will pass over.. There is a wide difference between the exercise of power by a sovereign State over its own ports and the exercise of an overriding power of a limited character over the ports of sovereign States. No doubt alt these matters can be dealt with under the head of navigation laws, and it may be a question for the High Court to determine, if. these clauses are passed into law, whether the power has not been taken in a wrong-; way, and, consequently, whether this Bill is really good law. That is a legal proposition, but I think it is one which may be fairly considered in committee. In other ways I feel that the Bill possesses admirable qualities, . and I am sure every member of the Senate will do his utmost to speedily pass those of its provisions which are excellent, and which properly come within the scope of our authority. </para>

Our experience in Tasmania has been that costs against the Grown or against the police are never accorded the successful appellant. That is a matter of practice. </para>

                            <para>- The matter would be determined according to the law of. the State in which the case was dealt with. So far as our State is concerned a successful appellant, no matter how iniquitous the decision appealed from may have been, and no matter whether during the appeal it has been indicated that there has been an attempt on the part of the police, or some one else, to unnecessarily or unwarrantable prosecute him, must be satisfied with getting the decision reversed. Costs against the Crown and police are not awarded by the court. The measure should indicate in express terms that it is within the power of the court to award costs to a successful appellant. Moreover, power should be given to the court to award not only costs to the successful appellant, but to allow him something in the nature of damages, as against the department as compensation for the loss of a particular issue which may have been destroyed by order of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                            <para>- That is not the principle on which our courts of justice are conducted, and the interjection which the Postmaster-General has made indicates another danger. A newspaper proprietor who had not large funds might be made the very victim of this clause, because the department recognised that even if he did succeed in his appeal he could not get costs. Clauses 40 and 41 are somewhat analogous to those I have just dealt with. They contain provisions empowering the Postmaster-General to examine newspapers and packets, and blasphemous or indecent letters may be destroyed. In regard to clause 41, however, there is no provision analagous to that in the clause to which I have just referred which would enable an individual to make any appeal at all. It gives a still more arbitrary power to the Postmaster-General. And not only the Postmaster-General but the Deputy Postmaster-General may deal with these matters. As some honorable senators have indicated, the Deputy Postmasters-General in some of the States have not given entire satisfaction to the public. I think that I and others from Tasmania can say that that has been our experience. The clause says that - </para>

So far as Tasmania is concerned, we have, in the first instance, an Act for the suppression of gaming and betting, and it is absolutely unlawful for any two individuals to make a bet in a public place, and a race-course is a public place within the meaning of the Act. We have no bookmakers, no bookmakers' shops, and no totalizators except those which are used on the race-courses - we have none in private shops. No private individual is allowed to make a bet of any kind on any event in any public place, even including a race-course. Our methods of gambling are therefore restricted, so far as horse racing is concerned, to investments on the totalizator. And for our totalizators we have rules and regulations laid down. They are subject to the supervision of the State through officers appointed for that purpose, and who attend on the race-course. </para>

                            <para>- Precisely ; and I would not be here if I did not know all about these things. I think that all who come here should know about them. Why should we get up and condemn Tattersall down to the lowest if we do not know all about him ? When the drawing is to take place, the time and the place are notified to the Government, and a Government official is in attendance there. And, further than that, the whole of the proceedings are open to the public, and any individual, whether he be an investor or not, may attend there at the drawing, and take a part in it, and then go and get breakfast with some of them, for they generally extend that to one, I believe. Under these circumstances, as honorable senators must agree, Tasmania has not, through any laxity in her legislation, encouraged gambling. We have been told that the presence of Tattersall in a particular community has been very dire in its results ; that the evil effects have been pronounced ; that it is a most pernicious system to have existing in any community. What has been the result in Tasmania, which my honorable and learned friend calls the black sheep of the States? I think I may fairly, on behalf of the State I represent, challenge comparison with any other State in the union per head of the population, or on any other basis that any person may like, as to its moral character, and as to the absence of crime in the community. </para>

                            <para>- So far as Tasmania is concerned, there is no evidence of any deterioration in the moral character of the community. We will take, for instance, the opportunities for gambling which are afforded in other States, and contrast them with those afforded in Tasmania. We are told by some persons that if we allow gambling to exist we open the door to petty sssspeculation by those who cannot afford to practice gambling, but are induced by the encouragement held out to take what does not belong to them, and put it into some form of speculation or another. Where do these inducements mostly exist? In Tasmania, where the individual would have to go and get a postal note or a post-office order and give his name ; where he would have to write a letter and send it through the post ; where the very amount he sent, the letter he sent, and the application form he filled up, could all be traced, because they are all kept; or in a State like Victoria or, I presume, New South Wales, where a man can easily lift 5s. or 10s. and go and put it into the bag of a bookmaker and simply get his ticket ? In which State do honorable senators say are the inducements held out for petty peculation ? That is one of the arguments which are used against Tattersall. I claim that the way in which Tattersall's consultation is conducted in Tasmania has tended, so far as we are concerned, to eliminate the most undesirable elements in connexion with gambling. I think every honorable senator will agree with me that we cannot by legislation eradicate from human nature those things which are deeply implanted in it. If we attempt to extinguish the gambling element, if we attempt to eradicate the tendency from human nature by mere legislation, what will be the result? Does any honorable senator think we shall be successful? </para>

If you had been perfectly honest and perfectly fair, and if you had tried to do all you could to prevent the community of your various States from participating in a lottery like Tattersall's, why have not your various State Parliaments done all they could do - why have they not prevented the very communications from other States passing through their own central post-offices - have you done it ? No. I have heard honorable senators say that the attitude of Tasmania has had the effect of neutralizing the legislation of other States. If the other States liked to carry their legislation to a logical conclusion, why did they not prevent, each and every one of them, every communication passing through their post-offices to the State of Tasmania when they were addressed to Tattersall ? They have not done it. </para>

                            <para>- I beg to differ with the two honorable senators who say "no," and I respectfully submit to the Senate that if the Parliament of Victoria had wished to lay down in its Post-office Act or its Post-office Amendment Act, that the Postmaster-General should not carry any communications through Victoria to any person who was admitted to be carrying on a lottery of this description, it could have been clone. </para>

                            <para>- Apart altogether from the international agreement, I submit that if they had gone on this principle of social legislation their Postmaster-General could have been prevented from doing that. And there has been no attempt made on the part of any of the Legislatures of the States to prevent those who are subject to their jurisdiction from participating in this lottery in the way indicated. Speaking as one who is not accustomed to indulge in this mild form of excitement very frequently - in fact if I were to be asked now, or if I were to reflect for half-an-hour, I do not think 1 could say when I last had a ticket in Tattersall. But at the same time, I strongly and sincerely object to the assumption that by allowing Tattersall to 'carry on his operations in the Commonwealth, subject to the present conditions and restrictions, we are encouraging the evil. I submit, most distinctly, that as far as gambling is concerned our legislation is far in advance of the legislation of any of the other States. </para>

In the case of the investor in Tattersall's, he has to send his application through the post ; it remains in the office of Tattersall, and if he has been guilty of sspeculation, it can be traced home to him much more readily than if he had taken the cash out of the till and gone to Ikey Moses and dropped it into his bag. </para>

                            <para>- I am very sorry to hear that, because I was under the impression that South Australia was the paradise of legislative and administrative effort in this matter. It is a matter of administration. The honorable senator has told us that a great deal of gambling goes on there. That proves my argument. If you do away with the most legitimate form of gambling that you have, and if you do not eradicate the gambling instinct altogether, you allow it to manifest itself in other ways and directions, which are far more injurious to the morals of the community. We have in Tasmania a law which, so far from having produced evil effects on the community, has been productive of effects which by the general community have been considered good. I possibly should except a few extremists from a religious point of view, and a few extremists from a bookmaking point of view. You will get, in your opposition to such an institution as Tattersall, a large number of bookmakers. They do not approve of a form of gambling of that character, which is subject to State supervision ; but I hope honorable senators will consider this. A law does exist in Tasmania with regard to Tattersall. It is a law which we consider, and rightly consider, is far more stringent than the law which exists in any of the other States ; but in that law we recognise there is a human instinct which leads to gambling. We do not attempt to take upon ourselves the herculean and impossible task of eradicating that instinct. We endeavour by our legislation to so arrange that this instinct shall have full play for its manifestation in a direction which is subject to the greatest amount of State inspection, so that every individual who participates in that form of gambling shall not be subject to any of the inconveniences and dishonest practices to which he is subjected in other forms of gambling. </para>

He might still carry on his operations there, notwithstanding the stringency of this clause. My objection to the clause is taken upon this basis : I think, with other senators, that gambling is not a thing to be encouraged, but I say that the way in which the Tasmanian Legislature has faced the question has been the only correct way so far adopted in the States of the Union. If we are going to fly in the face of experience, the experience of centuries and centuries, and attempt by Act of Parliament to make men mora], we shall distinguish ourselves in a . way that we shall not very well be proud of in the future. We shall find that all our attempts , in this direction are abortive. We shall find that Tattersall will go elsewhere, and the very evil we are trying to minimize will not be lessened. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. While the railways remain under the control of the States, I submit that no recalcitrant State could be compelled to comply with the terras of this clause. Clause 17 provides for a payment. If they do the work it is necessary that they should be paid. There is no provision with regard to private railways. Private railways, I submit, must stand in this particular connexion exactly in the same position as the proprietors of coaches or the proprietors of means of communication other than railways. </para>

They cannot commandeer the proprietors of a line of coaches or a company which owns a private railway. In Tasmania we have a number of private railways which are already carrying mails, and must inevitably carry mails under the altered conditions. </para>

                        <para>-- - I can very strongly commend the determination of the Postmaster-General that this great and important department shall be run on commercial lines: I sincerely trust that each of the great departments taken over by the Commonwealth will be run exactly on the same principles? I think it would be a mistake to allow the introduction of philanthropy or other affairs of the States to be mixed up with the commercial principles upon which a great department like this should be conducted. I am extremely anxious to see the department pay, because I am convinced that until that result is obtained we cannot have penny postage throughout the Commonwealth. That isa very important matter, and I trust that before long we will be enabled, to inaugurate the system. As business men we can see that if the department does not pay under the present rates, we cannot possibly expect to introduce the penny post throughout the: Commonwealth .. </para>

We ought to recognise the rights of the States in these matters. If there were no Deputy Postmasters General considerable confusion and disorganization would result and there would also be delay if every person had to appeal to Caesar in the person of the Postmaster-General of theCommonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- A great deal has been said about what I consider is a very trivial matter in regard to clause 16, which provides that the railways " shall " carry mail's. If there is any doubt as. to whether the Federal Parliament has power to make any such provision, then the sooner that doubt is settled in our High Court the better it will be. It is absolutely essential to. the Comm om wealth that we should have that power. It would place us in a ridiculous position if the Governments of the States were able to say, " We will not carry the mails of the Commonwealth." In the very next clause it is provided that the price shall be mutually agreed upon or be settled by arbitration. Now,, considering that the railway is a common carrier, it must carry mails if the price to be paid for the work is mutually agreed upon. If I were a farmer, for example, with a load of wheat, the railway would have to carry that wheat if I were willing to pay the ordinary price; and if it had facilities for doing so. Surely the Government can exact the same terms as those given to private individuals. Under clause 19 there is a very dangerous precedent in the proposal that the Governor in Council shall fix the rates of postage. That practically means that the . States which, for the first five years, are principally interested would be in the position of having, their rates raised or lowered, and their revenue increased or decreased, at the will of a single individual. The States should not be placed in such a position. As the representatives of the States it is our duty to safeguard their interests. The difficulty might be overcome by providing in the regulation that alterations in rates should not come into force until Parliament had approved of them. Clause 44 is a very good one, providing as it does that all unclaimed letters and telegrams delivered at hotels must be returned to the post-office, under penalty, within one month. I have not seen such a provision in any other Postal Act. </para>

I have known many instances in which important letters have been sent to hotels and have remained there for months, with the result that the addressees have suffered great loss. AVe have heard a very great deal .about the moral aspect of an institution called Tattersall, and an honorable senator very eloquently, for about three-quarters of an hour, dilated on the virtues of that institution. But there is ' nothing in this Bill tending to stop or do away with Tattersall. All we say is, that every State in Australia has declared against Tattersall, and therefore we have a right which was previously denied through the individual States to say that we shall not allow letters from those States to go into Tasmania. We do not say that Tattersall must be closed up. They can have Tattersall for Tasmania. </para>

Otherwise the various States will still be placed under contribution for the benefit of Tattersall and the revenue derived from it by the Tasmanian Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to speak at any length, but I feel it is incumbent on me, with others, to congratulate the Postmaster-General upon, generally speaking, the excellent manner in which the clauses of the Bill have been presented. So much has been said upon the various clauses, which, no doubt, will be debated at greater length in committee, that I do not propose devoting any time to them now. As regards clause 16, I cannot see the great danger which some honorable senators see. I think that the clause would be inoperative - almost inoperative at any rate - if the Postmaster-General had not power to order or commandeer the State railways to carry the mails. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator did not use the term the Bill has been described by very many speakers as a machinery Bill, and I think it is generally accepted as a machinery Bill in the greater sense. I object to any matter which is so purely a matter of social legislation being introduced into a Bill which is almost in every sense a machinery Bill. If we allowed this clause to pass in its present form - and I sincerely hope that honorable senators will think it oven well before they do -we can, with an equal show of reason, introduce into any machinery Bill either here or elsewhere, social legislation in other directions. If gambling is an evil - and I am not going to say it is or is not an evil, because that is purely a matter of opinion - and we think it well to suppress it, why not attack it in a fair, open, and honest manner? The senators from other States who are so anxious to push Tattersall out of Tasmania, where he has found a resting place, have not said anything about the pernicious effects of legislation with regard to gambling in their own States: There are many different issues involved. In the six States there are six different kinds of legislation affecting, gambling. In Tasmania, we allow Tattersall; but we do not allow bookmakers or betting, except on registered race-courses, and then only for a certain number of meetings. We do not allow shop- tot a liza tors or street betting. We allow no kind, or shape, or manner, or form of gambling except through the medium of Tattersall. </para>

                            <para>- I do not mean to say that gambling is not carried on " under the rose," but I do contend' that if we want to attack gambling, we should attack it in a proper manner, and not in. an indirect way like thick. In Victoria bookmakers are allowed, and sweep promoters are not; neither is the totalizator. In New South Wales bookmakers are allowed and the totalizator is not ; neither are sweeps. In South. Australia the totalizator is allowed, bookmakers, are not,, and. consultations are not. In Queensland both totalizator and book-makers are allowed. In Western Australia consultations are allowed, as well as bookmakers, and I believe also the totalizator, but I say that subject to correction. If we desire to suppress gambling, why should we attack it by a side issue, instead of in a fair, open, and honest way? I cannot find in the '"39 articles" of the Constitution one article which, in the smallest possible sense, seems to me to allow us to interfere with social legislation in this way. </para>

                            <para>- No matter with what stretch of imagination you read the 39 articles, they do not give us power to take from the States the right to legislate on a social matter, which this undoubtedly is. It is not that I am afraid that Tasmania will lose its little mess of pottage - the £15,000 or £20,000. It is not on financial grounds that I object to this clause, but it is a matter of principle. I say this undoubtedly is an infringement of the liberty of the subject, and I sincerely hope the Postmaster-General will consider the advisability of amending the clause so that it will not interfere with a matter that certainly should be left to the State Legislatures. I will not detain the Senate any longer upon this much vexed question, but before sitting down I wish to add my congratulations to those of other honorable members to the Postmaster-General for the excellent exposition of the Bill which he has given us ; and I trust that when it comes before the committee I shall have an opportunity of expressing my opinion on very many of the clauses. In some respects they may be amended, and I hope we shall succeed in making the Bill a useful piece of legislation for the Commonwealth. </para>

Even if the report is brought up to-morrow it will have to be submitted for consideration on a subsequent day, and it seems to me hardly worth while to shift the motion about from day to day when there is no probability of bringing it on. </para>

While this question was under discussion I made the statement that I would not move the motion. I was supporting the Government in their proposals for temporary standing orders being adopted, and was opposing the amendment that there should be a select committee. The honorable senator was successful ; he brought up his standing orders, and I have never said a word about the matter since. </para>

                <para>Since I tabled this motion, I have learnt from my honorable friend in charge of the Government business, that he has some objection to the mode in which the motion is framed. He informs me that he sees no objection to laying on the table any document referring to a particular subject, but he does not think Ministers should be called upon to lay all documents of importance on the table. In tabling the motion, I was following the practice which we have in Tasmania, and there must be something like it in the other States, whereby a member desiring to see what correspondence on important matters has been going on between the Premier and the Agent-General moves a motion of this sort. We never have been pub to the trouble of moving a separate motion for each set of documents. It struck me whilst some senators were moving for one lot of papers that it would be much better to ask for all papers referring to matters of public importance not being confidential matters. Now there are various subjects upon which the Prime Minister has been corresponding which are -not only of public "importance, but which demand tile attention of every senator. I take it for granted that he has been corresponding about the appointment of " a Commandant, that he has been corresponding about the New Hebrides, that he has been corresponding about alien labour, and also about what will be the position of Australia if she gives in a uniform Tariff preference to the goods of Great Britain. All these are matters on which we ought to be informed, and I should be very glad if the Minister could consent to the motion. If there are any modifications which I could make in it J. would be very glad to make them. </para>

                        <para>- What one senator might consider to be a matter of public importance, another might regard as of no importance at all. The motion, if carried, will be an order of this Parliament, and it will hold good for the whole of the session. I suppose that is so. At the commencement of the session the Government Printer would practically be let loose in all departments - because I do not know who is to decide whether a matter is of public importance or not - and he would be called upon to print a lot of papers. If we were once to say that this must be done all these things would have to be brought down at the commencement of the session. During the session the Government Printer would also have to be supplied with all papers that might be considered of public importance, and all this merely for the sake of supplying au honorable senator with some information that he could obtain by moving for it. Is it not better to adopt the plan to which I have been accustomed- - the more economical system - that when an honorable senator desires information he should ask for it, and that the Senate should decide whether the papers should be printed or not? I think it is going a little too far to ask the Senate to consent to an order requiring the Government Printer to circulate amongst honorable senators correspondence on all sorts of subjects, relating to everything under the sun. 1 would ask the honorable senator, unless he feels keen upon it, to withdraw the motion. I can assure him that there is no disposition on the part of the Government to hold back any information that could be useful to senators or to the public, and I hardly think it is desirable that he should persist in his motion. On behalf of the Government I cannot support it. </para>

If I did not get the satisfaction to which every honorable senator is entitled, I would come here, and I would then expect other honorable senators who probably at times would be placed in the same position as myself to support me in demanding information if it was a legitimate request. Honorable senators have been talking for hours about the vagueness of the Government policy, but there is nothing so vague in the Government policy as a resolution of this kind. There is not even a definition in the resolution of the words "publicimportance,"noris it stated,whatought to be printed, or anything else. It is the most vague thing that has ever been placed before a public body. I hope that honorable senators who move resolutions without consulting their neighbours about questions of this description will be treated as the Ishmaelites of the Senate. I hope that in such circumstances they will not get the support they expect. When they come with a legitimate resolution to get information which we have a right to obtain, which will be of service, and which we may conscientiously askfor,then they will obtain support. </para>

                        <para>- Before we deal with the important subject of a white Australia it will become the duty of every senator to see the correspondence that has taken place, and which shows the grounds upon which a most important Bill relating to sugar companies has been refused the Royal assent. There are other subjects on which we shall want to see the papers. However, as the Postmaster-General has informed me that they can be seen by individual members on calling at his office, and as I have no doubt that sooner or later they will be laid on the table, I have no objection to withdraw my motion. </para>
