                    <para>. -I rise to ask leave to move a motion without notice to further the consideration of the Customs Bill. When a Bill is reported with amendments it is necessary to set the adoption of the report down for a later day. If we report the Customs Bill to-day with amendments it cannot be recommitted until next sitting day. I ask the House, therefore, to suspend the standing orders so as to enable me, on the motion for the adoption of the report, to move the recommittal to-day. If this is done new clauses can be dealt with on recommittal, and the final adoption of the report may be set down for Wednesday, and on that day it will be open to any honorable senator to move for a recommittal. On the other hand, if we have done with the Bill to-day the third reading can be taken on the following sitting day. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I think the third paragraph provides more especially for private warehouses where the services of a locker are required only occasional, and not regularly. In this Bill we have made great provision for private warehouses rather than for bonding warehouses. Supposing that a tobacco manufacturer or a spirit merchant has a private bonding warehouse. It is only occasionally that he requires the services of a locker, and then not at any fixed hour. &gt; When the services of a locker are required, he rings up the Custom-house and asks that a locker may be sent down ; but that is only done at irregular intervals. I am trying to make, provision for warehouses requiring the service, of a locker on at least one-half of every working day. In South Australia they have always had the advantage of such a provision as I am now striving to insert in this schedule. By leaving the schedule as it stands we shall encourage private warehouses to the detriment of the public bonded warehouses, and I venture to think that in doing so we shall be running a greater risk of loss of revenue than by having, bonded warehouses, such as we have now in South Australia, which give very heavy securities for their good conduct. There are at least seven well-known firms at Port Adelaide which have been doing business there for many years, and which, unless the amendment I, recommend is made, will have to go to the Customhouse every day and ask that they may have a locker sent to their warehouses. If my proposal is adopted there will be a locker allotted to A and B, who will know that his services will be available for each for one week in the morning and the next week in the afternoon, and so on. Consequently, their customers will know when to come and their business will be conducted without loss or inconvenience. Unless we provide that they shall have the service of a locker the chances are that sometimes a rush may be made on the Customhouse for lockers, and those who are doing a regular business may not be able to obtain the services of one. That would cause very great loss and inconvenience to the trade of our port. The locker is entirely under the control of the collector, and his services would be quite as fully occupied in attending to two- warehouses as if the two were combined into one, requiring the services of a locker all the time. I fail to see why
                    should object to the provision. The paragraph- as it stands would not meet the requirements I am striving to provide for, because the warehousemen want to be quite sure that the services of a locker will be available to them for a half -day every day. I do not see* how the revenue can be jeopardized in any way ; and while we are striving to guard against loss of revenue we ought also to seek to protect the commercial community from inconvenience and loss. If my proposal is acceded to, greater facilities will be granted to the commercial community, and I am sure that it will aid materially in the conduct of business.

                    (Queensland - . Postmaster-General). - This does not seem to be a matter of very great importance ; but I fail to understand the contention of
                    that what he desires cannot be carried out under the paragraph as it stands. It seems to me that it can, and that in some cases the paragraph would operate more conveniently than the proposal he makes. The provision as to £50 per annum shows that an arrangement may be made with the Collector of Customs for the partial services of a locker. What is there to prevent an arrangement being made under this paragraph that a locker shall give his services for three days to one firm and three days to another
                    M.\r point is that the practice that is now carried out in South Australia and Victoria could be earned out under this paragraph. An arrangement could also be made, if necessary, for a locker to give
                    in the mornings to one firm and in the afternoons to another. That would secure all
                    desires. But there may be other cases where the services of a looker are only required for a third of the time. In that case payment should only be made for the third of the time.
                    amendment would not provide for such a case ; but this paragraph appears to me to give the collector sufficient power to carry out the practice which at present exists, and to make an arrangement by which the services of a locker may be secured for any time, long or short.

                    (New South Wales).There should not ' be any great difficulty in arriving at an agreement on this schedule, because speakers from both sides
                    chamber have expressed a desire to make the measure as convenient as possible for the general public, consistent with the safety of the revenue and the practical working of the Bill. The only point is - does this schedule provide in the most convenient way for all classes of cases that are likely to present themselves ? I think it does not. It seems to me to be simply a matter of arithmetic. I am going to take the case instanced by the Postmaster-General. He pointed out that the holder of a bond might wish to have the services of a locker for half-a-day, on every day in the week. The services of a locker under the scale of charges set out in the third paragraph would involve the payment of 2s. per hour, with an annual charge not exceeding £50. I think I am correct in saying that in no case is an annual charge of less than £25 made. I take that to be the minimum. Now 2°s. per hour for four hours for six days a week would mean that a small bond holder requiring the services of a locker half-a-day a week would be paying £155 a year, which is more than the amount required for the services of a locker in a larger bond. The Government may say that although £25 has been the minimum annual change hitherto, they may make it lower than that. I invite the Government to say that they will charge a less amount. I take it, however, that £35 would be the irreduceable minimum. In that case it means that one of these small bonded warehouses would be paying £5 a year more than a larger bond requiring the whole services of a locker. The schedule does not equitably provide for the case

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - 'There is one -other point from the Customs point of view to which I should like to direct attention. I know that the Customs authorities always prefer to have the services of these lockers definitely engaged, instead of having a number of men waiting about, kicking their heels in the expectation of employment at 2s. an hour. The suggestion made by
                    is a perfectly satisfactory one, and is now acted upon, and, where two bonds want a locker between them, the locker is secured and the cost divided between the two.

                    (South Australia). - What
                    has suggested is practically, the same as what I have suggested. I want to provide that the services of a locker can be absolutely obtained by two warehousemen, and in the amendment I have submitted it will be seen that I have simply followed the phraseology of the Bill. I should like to say that there need be no. fear of altering the schedule, because, as presented to us now, it is not the schedule as originally introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs. We will not be altering the work of that Minister, and by inserting the words I propose we may only be conforming with the desire of the Minister for Trade and Customs himself. I can assert that paragraph 3 is solely intended to meet the cases of private warehouses where the services of a locker are required only intermittently. It will be seen that the time occupied by the locker in going from a private warehouse :to the Custorn-hou.se, or between two private warehouses where he is only intermittently employed, must be charged to some person other than the locker; and this charge of £50 is intended to enable the Minister to charge the warehouses with the locker's time in passing to and fro. Where there is a fixed payment for a locker there is of course no such loss of time. I fail to see why the Minister should not agree to my proposed amendment.

                        there was power under this Bill by which the Minister could make regulations to deal with this matter, it would be all right. But no such power exists, and these fees are absolutely fixed and defined by the Bill.
                        thinks the amendment would be unfair to the small men ; but I ask that honorable senator to reconcile his ideas of fairness with the figures I have already given, which show that a small man under this schedule may be required to pay more for half the. services of a locker than the large warehouseman may have to pay for the whole services of a locker. There is no power of regulation in the Bill by which the Minister can get away from that. If there was such a power it might be the best way out of the difficulty.

                    and at the same time remove a difficulty that exists in the minds of some other honorable senators. I think the whole difficulty would be met by the insertion at the beginning of the schedule of the words - " where one or not more than two warehouses require the services," and so on. Those who have had any experience in Victoria and in the other States must have come to the conclusion long ago that it is not wise to have a large number of small warehouses, because it leaves room for the evasion of duties.
                    idea is that where one warehouse requires the services of a locker for half-time there should be a fairly liberal allowance made.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - In Victoria there is practically only one private bond, and there is not the slightest objection to a fee of £50 being paid. It is not in the interests of the Customs, and consequently of the public, to encourage a large number of small bonds. It is an element of very great danger, and undue facilities should not be given in that direction. In Victoria there are 26 machinery bonds each paying £25, one paying £15, and one paying £10, and an open yard paying £1.

                        <para>- That is really a repetition of a statement which has been made here twice, and implies that the small trader is less honest than the big one. I deny that a man's honesty is in proportion to his worldly goods or the extent of his operations. When we remember that these bonds, small or large, are under the control of the Customs officer, and can only be entered when he is present, what greater facilities for fraud exists in a room which is large than in a room which is small ? It does not appear to me that there is any force at all in the imputation that the smallness of the bond bears some relation to the attempts at fraud which can be carried on. The proposal as it stands, giving the Minister a discretion to fix the fee at a sum not exceeding £50, is a very fair compromise between the two sets of circumstances with which we have to deal. It may be undesirable to multiply the bonds without limit. On the other hand, it is equally undesirable to place any restriction on the fair carrying on of commercial operations. While the first proposal submitted by the draftsman put £25 as a fixed minimum, we are asked now to give the Minister a discretion to put £50 as a maximum for small bonds which only require the intermittent services of a locker. In New South Wales there is a very large number of bonds in respect to which the fee is charged under Ministerial discretion, and a more beneficial exercise of that elasticity it would be hard to find. In New South Wales, and it must be the same in Victoria, the varying circumstances of each bond and of each town are such that it is practically impossible to provide for them in any regulation. All you can do, having stated the limits within which the Minister may go to, is to leave it to him to fix the fee according to the circumstances of the bond and the requirements of the place. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to move an amendment in the definition of "collector" and of "officer." The first word has a gradually descending importance until, practically, it includes every officer ; and I propose to omit all the words in the definition after the word "place." I have frequently drawn attention to the extraordinarily wide interpretation given to the term "officer." Junior clerks, female searchers, boatmen, and all persons employed by the Customs in any capacity are included in the term. In the English Act there is- no interpretation of the word, but throughout its provisions the, general practice is to speak of the proper officer, or the officer duly authorized. I propose to have this definition - "Officer" means any officer doing duty in the matter in relation to which the expression is used. </para>

But I begin to doubt it. I am amused at the view he puts forward in. defence of this definition. The definition imposes no limitation at all, and states that the term " officer" shall include anybody and everybody employed in the Customs service. There is nothing to indicate any check upon any officer. It is ridiculous. However, I am not going to waste the time of the committee by further discussing it. The Bill belongs to the Government, and if they choose to make it ridiculous, it will be to their discredit.

                    (New South Wales) - The word " officer," as defined here, is very wide indeed. How can it be ascertained what are the limitations cast upon the officers of the Customs ? One officer may have a certain duty alloted to him, and another officer another duty. But they may change their duties to please themselves, and then a certain o cer will not be acting under the instructions of the department, but at his own sweet will.

                        <para>- It was my intention to ask the committee to go right through with this Bill to-day, and to deal with the new clause and the recommitted clauses. But yesterday my right honorable colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, had an interview with a deputation which brought forward some very important matters for consideration, some of which are involved in the new clauses to be proposed by other honorable senators. My colleague has had a conversation with me this morning, the result of which is that we think there is sufficient matter m what was brought before me yesterday to entitle it to consideration in connexion with the new clauses which are to be proposed. Without expressing any opinion as to what we intend to do about the matter, we think it desirable to have a consultation before the new clauses are dealt with. When progress upon this Bill is reported, I shall ask the Senate to proceed with the Beer Excise Bill, which is one of those measures that require to be passed into law before the Tariff can be proceeded with.

                        <para>- I am- sure there will .be very little debate on the second reading of this measure, because we must recognise that it is necessary that a Bill of this character should be passed before we can proceed to the consideration of our customs and excise duties. With the assurance of the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the Bill is substantially in conformity with the Bills existing in the different States dealing with a similar matter, I have no doubt the Senate will be prepared to carry the second reading -with very little delay. There are, however, one or two matters in connexion with the Bill which will require a little consideration in committee. One has reference to the position of houses belonging to breweries which are licensed for the sale of wines and spirits. We know that the object of. the clause dealing with the matter is to prevent the possibility of any illicit distillation or illicit sale on the part of brewers. As at first introduced, this clause was rather Obnoxious, because it made a hard-and-fast limit -with regard to the distance from the place where the beer was brewed, or the place in which wines and spirits could be sold. Clause 20 originally provided that no brewer should sell .spirits in his brewery or at any place within 50 yards thereof, but the clause has been amended since it was originally introduced in the other House, and it now provides that no brewer shall - </para>

                        <para>- These words have been very carefully considered, and I think they are better than those suggested. The Constitution Act simply declares the effect of our legislation. There is no doubt that any State Act which would be inconsistent with the provisions of this Act would be invalid without any declaration to that effect at all, and this wording merely serves to make plain the application of the Bill. In saying that it shall apply to duties imposed by the Parliament, and to the exclusion after the imposition of such excise of the operation of all State Acts relating to the excise on beer, the intention is to make it perfectly clear that until the imposition of excise by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the State Acts may remain in operation for the purposes of the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- I think we should have some further explanation with regard to this clause, which is really of very great importance. I do not see any similar clause in the Customs Bill, and this seems to indicate some intention on the part of the Government to follow one course with regard to excise duties, and another course with regard to customs duties ; I mean with regard to the bringing in of what we are all looking for, the uniform Tariff. I presume the uniform Tariff will impose not only duties of customs, but also duties of excise, and I should like to understand from the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether this clause indicates any intention on the part of the Government to bring in these duties of excise in any different way to that which may. be proposed by the Government with regard to duties of customs. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware that they do, and this clause does not affect their operation in any way. The section of the Constitution upon which we are relying under the Customs Bill is section 109, leaving it to the interpretation of the enactment which is in question in each case, in the light Of that section, to determine whether or not the Act is in force. There is no such difficulty here, and therefore we can put the provision plainly on the face of the Bill. The honorable senator can rest assured that this matter has been carefully gone into, and that it is necessary, in order to state plainly what the effect of the Act and its application is, to have the clause in that form. . </para>

The collection of the duty may commence on a certain day, the day on which the proposal is laid on the table of the House, or on a later date. I cannot make any statement about the date at present. The honorable senator will see at once that it is a part of the general policy of the Tariff which it would not be desirable to make a statement about at the present time ; but we shall have regard necessarily to the date of the collection of the duties in deciding the day on which the proclamation is to be made. </para>

                        <para>- As honorable senators are aware, when they buy a quart bottle of ale, they do not get a quart of ale. I understand that in the strict sense of the word no such thing as a quart bottle of ale is sold in any State. What is sold is a reputed quart of ale, and six reputed quarts go to the gallon. The brewers will be compelled to pay duty on ale which is not in existence unless we bring this definition strictly into accord with the facts. I want the definition to be put in this form - "Quarts" or "pints" means quart or pint - bottles of glass or stone, and includes bottles reputed to contain quarts or pints, six reputed quarts or twelve reputed pints to be held to contain one gallon. </para>

                        (Tasmania). - It is a very important thing that the brewers should not have to pay on more ale than the bottles contain. The duty on a dozen of ale in the one case would be 1 2s. 6d., and in the other 17s. 6d. The brewers are rather concerned about this phraseology. Although I, as a lawyer, think that the Minister is right in what he says, still there is the possibility that a collector may say - " Here is a quart bottle; four quarts goto a gallon. I do not know anything about reputed quarts, and I shall charge you duty on a gallon." As it involves the payment of duty, I think the definition ought to say what it means.

                            <para>- There is a reason for the inclusion of this definition. An Act of this sort must be worked very largely by regulation, and the reference is throughout these clauses- to the working 'of the Act, which, of course, will include the regulations. If the amendment which my honorable friend suggests were made, it would be necessary all through the Bill after the word "Act" to insert the words "and regulations thereunder." It is to save the repetition of that phrase that we adopted this method in the interpretation clause. The only regulations which could be proved as binding under the Act would be those which had been properly made and laid before Parliament. No other regulations could be enforced. </para>

                        <para>- Some brewers are dissatisfied that every year they should be called upon to give a fresh security or bond for the annual licence. They say that they have to pay a stamp duty in some States on each occasion. The amendment I intend to propose in the clause is to the effect that when the security is given, it shall be security, not only for the licence for that year, but also for the renewal of the licence. There is no danger in making that amendment, because under clause 18 the collector may require the applicant for the renewal of the licence to give fresh security, and if it is not given, he may refuse to renew it. If, after a bond has been given three or four years back, one of the sureties dies, or from being a millionaire becomes practically a pauper, the collector may ask for a fresh bond. But my object is that there shall be no need to get a fresh bond when only a renewal is required. I move - </para>

                        (Tasmania). - I take it that when a licence is issued security is given for that particular licence, and when a new licence is issued the security is dead. In Tasmania, licensees have to give a new bond every year. The bond in future will be so worded as to be a security not only for the licence this year, but for all future years, until the collector asks for a new security, under clause . 18. Clause 18 is inserted because a bond may be given by a gentleman who is worth say £.10,000 this year, and next year may not be worth 10,000 farthings. The surety may before the end of the year become a poor man, and the collector must have the right to ask for a new bond on that account.

                        <para>- I do not think there is any difficulty about it. The intention is to allow this bond to be given once and for all. It may extend for a number of years as long as the collector is satisfied. That is why power is given in clause18, so that if a man's credit is going down, or the business is conducted in a way that makes the bond not worth so much, a new security may be demanded. There is no reason why the bond should be for more than a year. If it is only for a year it will only hold good for a year ; but the amendment will enable the bond to be given for a longer period if necessary. </para>

                        <para>- It has been suggested that the power contained in this clause is rather an enormous one to put into the hands of a collector - that he can, for any offence whatever, cancel a brewer's licence. Under the Tasmanian Act, even for an absolute attempt to evade payment of duty, there is a fine of not less than £100 and not more than £200. Under our own Customs Bill, even for smuggling, it is not proposed to take away an importer's licence. But under this clause," the whole of a man's trade, so far as it concerns the one article he manufactures, may be taken away from him. This is an enormous penalty to impose. Therefore, I ask the Minister if he will not agree to amend the clause so as to provide for an appeal against the decision of the Minister ? </para>

                            <para>- That is the case. Every one who has had to deal with administration is aware that the real difficulty is to get Ministers to uphold the law strenuously. There is a much greater tendency to give way and be lax in the administration of Acts. This is a power that should be in the hands of the Minister for the prevention of the defrauding of the revenue. The only punishment that is adequate to a serious offence is taking away the licence. This is a very different thing from taking away a publican's licence. In that case a man has to comply with certain rules, which are made in the interests of public morality. But the rules that will have to be complied with under this clause affect the revenue, which will be left open to be plundered if a brewer who resorts to these practices is allowed to continue to carry on business. </para>

                        <para>- I find that under the Licensing Act of Victoria, which affects the product of the brewer, there is provision for the removal or the cancellation of the licence, and it is looked upon as a very serious punishment, and can only be inflicted in the case of a third conviction. Of course such a punishment affects not merely the licensee of the house, but also the owner of the property. In the case of a brewery, a comparatively small offence by the holder of the licence should not be followed by so serious a punishment as the cancellation of the licence. I believe 'the power should be exercised only upon a second conviction, and I would prefer that it should be as in the Victorian Licensing Act, only upon a third conviction. </para>

I have had as touch experience 'in Connexion with these matters as most 'honorable senators ; I have interviewed Ministers in Connexion with such matters, and I. do not believe that what has been suggested is possible. The Minister leans rather too much the other way, and if he errs at all it ison the side of leniency. The suggestions made appear tome to show a want of confidence in. the administration of the Common wealth, which I think is regrettable.

                        is in earnest with regard to this amendment, I rise briefly to point out to the Vice-President of the Executive Council that the insertion of these words will really strengthen the clause, and probably be the means of preventing the committal of these offences. If this power is given in a case where a man has been twice convicted of an offence, the clause will be a strong deterrent, and there will be less likelihood of any offences under the Bill being repeated.
                        merely wishes to emphasize the necessity for punishing a repetition of offences, and the amendment should be carried.

Whatever objections there may be to giving the "Minister power to cancel the licence where a merely trivial offence has been committed, he should certainly have the power where a fraud has been committed, even though it has been committed only once. A man should not be given a second chance to commit a fraud upon the revenue.

It will be recollected that in the early part of this year a number of deaths occurred in the United Kingdom from drinking arseniated beer. In Australia at any time some impure substance may be mixed with beer, and in a case of that kind the Minister should have power to cancel the brewer's licence. There may be in the trade extreme cases which would need the extreme penalty of the cancellation of the licence. </para>

                            <para>- These leavings are frequently endeavoured to be returned as beer that has gone bad, and a refund of duty is demanded. We should be disregarding the purpose of this Bill, which is for the protection of the revenue, if we left open the door to frauds of that kind. If a man has had beer for a reasonable time, and has consumed the principal portion of it, it is only right that the duty should be paid, and the clause is only intended to meet cases where beer has gone bad through some cause, after only a small portion has been consumed. </para>

I must ask my honorable and learned friend to absolve the brewers from doing what he says the publicans do. Does he mean to say that the publican and the brewer act in collusion - that the publican puts into a cask the drainings aud leavings of other casks and sends the beer to the brewer, who then makes a demand for refund of duty? I have never heard of such a thing. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that the general practice is at present that where any portion of the beer goes bad the Government refund the duty on that portion to the brewer. If the "Vice-President of the Executive Council can see his way to provide that when at least half the beer has gone bad there shall be a refund of duty, it will be a fair provision. In New South Wales I believe there is no restriction placed on the return of beer at all. In that State if only a quarter of the beer is left in the cask, and the rest goes bad, an allowance would be made in respect of it. We do not want to do an injustice to the brewers. </para>

There is the greatest possible danger in a provision of the kind. It is not a question of whether the brewer or the publican is given to fraud. But suppose the publican does return a cask, what is to prevent a brewer adding to that quantity of beer by putting in spoiled beer, and then pretending that the publican has returned it all to him ? </para>

However, it may yet prevent a waste of time if the Minister will promise to recommit the clause if it is thought necessary to further consider the desirability of making the quantity one-fourth instead of one-eighth. It would be a graceful act on the part of the Minister if he would consent to the recommittal of the clause for the purpose of making that alteration. </para>

If I have done anything wrong, I tender my apologies to the Minister ; but when an honorable senator who submits an amendment is informed by the Minister in charge of the Bill that, as a compromise, he will agree to a certain course being adopted, that can hardly be taken as a private communication. I hope the Minister does not mean to accuse me of making use of a private communication.

The clause would then make provision for the delivery of beer from either the one or the other. </para>

                        <para>- This clause has been pointed out to me as a most serious one affecting secrets of trade. I am told that all these breweries have their own particular mode of brewing. I regret that this Bill, like the Victorian Act, does not make it penal to have certain drugs in the brewery. It does appear unfair that the officer, after having access to all these inner secrets, should be able to go and sell that information to some one, or probably get an engagement, and Start in opposition. Surely there ought to be some means of protecting a brewer against such robbery. </para>

The power of supervising, for the purposes of revenue, what is going on in the brewery would be quite useless without a power of this kind, lt is similar to that which has existed before. </para>

I find that this clause does go beyond the provision in all the Acts I have seen, in giving the right to the officer to be present at the making of the beer. There may be some sacred and mysterious process in some part of the brewing. There is no desire to pry into that process, and I think the clause will be quite as effective for revenue purposes if that portion is omitted. I move - </para>

The provision the honorable senator has referred to is a proper provision to be inserted in a Health Act, and in most of the States there are Health Acts which contain such provisions and give power to inspectors to carry out the duties which would be involved in conducting matters of this kind. </para>

If we insert a provision of this kind in such a Bill as this, how is it to be administered ? The officers under this Bill will be charged with the duty of looking after the interests of the revenue, and it seems to me they should not be charged with duties which properly belong to inspectors under a Health Act or Foods Adulteration Act.

                        <para>-I trust that the Government will take up the same position on this matter as they took up in dealing with the Customs Bill on the question of the importation of oleomargarine. If oleomargarine is a deleterious substance, surely impure beer adulterated with these chemicals is quite as injurious; An amendment has been agreed to, under which a Customs officer would not require to be present at the making of beer, and that is the time when these ingredients will be added. That renders it all the more necessary that this amendment should be accepted. Under a Health Act only occasional visits are made by inspectors, but the excise officer would be constantly on the premises of a brewery. I trust the committee will not accept the advice of the Vice-President of the Executive Council, but will deal with this matter as it is dealt with in Victoria, and not in a Health Act. </para>

If it is accepted as an amendment to clause 56, any one who waters beer to increase its bulk will be subject to the some penalty as a person who adulterates beer with poisonous substances, and no one would say that there should be the same penalty for the two offences. I suggest that the amendment should be withdrawn with a view to proposing it as a new clause when the Bill is recommitted. </para>

                        (New South Wales).That is not a correct statement. Clause 42 says that no bottled beer shall be removed from a brewery unless a label is affixed to each bottle, but clause 57 does not say anything about removing beer from any other place than a brewery. Surely it is not intended that there shall be two labels put on a bottle of beer. No such thing as a bottling establishment is mentioned in either clause 42 or clause 57. There is only one place where the beer can be bottled, and that is in either the brewery or the delivery store. Surely it only wants one supervision for one label to go on one bottle.
