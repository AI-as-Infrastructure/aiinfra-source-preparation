			<para>Please wire me at once number of kanakas actually engaged in sugar work, state the districts, &amp;c. </para>
			<para>So far as I am concerned the only omission of a factor from my statement, which is serious enough to affect my conclusions, is one particularly prejudicing the district of Cairns, in its relation to the incidence of the bonus. The bonus is payable upon cane, and on the basis of ten tons of cane to one ton of sugar it amounts to £2 per ton of sugar. In the Cairns district, according to the census of 1900, the cane required to make a ton of sugar is not more than eight and a half tons, against more than ten and a half tons required in the Bundaberg district. </para>

				</talk.start>
				<para>The effect is to reduce the value of the bonus in the Cairns district from £2 to £1 14s. per ton of sugar, which, with the charges which will attach to the administration of the Acts, it is estimated will reduce the total value of duty and bonus to about £4 1 0s. per ton of sugar. As a result, the amount that will accrue from duty and bonus upon the tonnage of sugar given as the product of the Cairns district will be about £205,000, or some £30,000 less than the sum which it is estimated to cost to substitute the kanakas in the Cairns district by white men. </para>

The white man's skin is not as thick as that of the black man. When he works in the cane-brake, particularly in damp, hot weather, an irritant comes upon his skin, which is so trying as to drive him almost into a fever, and this is well known on the plantations as the "cane itch."

					<para>It is not now a question of federation or anti-federation, but I can safely and honestly say that if Messrs. Barton and Deakin, when they came to Brisbane some six or eight months before the vote was taken on federation, and charmed an audience of about 3,000 people in the Exhibition Hall, had shown their hand, and been honest and candid with the people of Queensland, there would never have been a majority in favour of federation. Now, I think when a man who knows nothing about the industry attempts to interfere with it in the way now proposed, he is doing a criminal act, and is no friend to Queensland. , I understand that the sugar-planters  to a man voted for federation, thinking that at all events they would get justice, and this is the sort of justice given to them. </para>

					<para>- If there were no better way of dealing with the question, I should be quite willing to buy them out. As a matter of fact, we are buying them out. The bonus of £6 a ton for the production of sugar with white labour, is a very good price to pay to the planters for the abolition of the kanakas. If it rested with me, I should not allow private persons to have a mortgage on the sugar trade. I consider that the Government will get very little in return for the very big price they are paying to the planters. All the return they will get is the honour of abolishing an inhuman traffic. </para>

					<para>- At the expense of the taxpayers of Australia. . In my opinion, the sugar trade, in which such close inspection is required, can only be properly conducted in the hands of the Government. If they could see their way to take over the trade, I should be only too happy to vote in that direction. We have a mandate from the electors to carry out. The Sphinx has spoken, and all the excuse's which have come from honorable senators and from the Government of Queensland cannot alter the fact that the verdict of the people at the federal elections was that the traffic must end. If we were to prolong its existence for more than five years we should be departing from that mandate. I support the Government in their very reasonable attitude. It is in accordance with their election pledges, and it is very creditable to them in every sense of the word. </para>

				<para>- I hold that no more important question can be debated in the Senate in this session than the abolition of the kanaka traffic. To me it is, if not the first, the second question of national importance. It is of greater importance than any other measure we are likely to have, except, perhaps, one before the close of the session. It is the duty of every honorable senator, if he feels as strongly as I do, to place on record the reasons which guide his vote on this Bill. There is no need to say that it is ah important question. Any question which can stir up in any section of the community in a State, such an agitation as this one has aroused, and is arousing in Queensland, must be of very vast importance. </para>

					<para>- Surely the working men of Northern Queensland have as much sense as the working men in other parts of Australia. If they believed that the abolition of the kanaka traffic was going to ruin them, and take away their source of labour, would they not have voted "No," instead of " Yes." I take it that that is the very best argument that could be advanced in favour of my view, that not only the people of Queensland generally, but of Cairns in particular, knew what would follow if that State joined the union. We are also confronted with the argument that even if white men would do the work in Northern Queensland, and if the planters were agreeable to pay them the wages they asked for, they are really physically unfit to do it. But there is a very trying kind of work that is being done by white men in all the -tropical ports of Australia, even as far north as within the Cairns district. I maintain that this work is equally as laborious as any work that has to be done upon the sugar plantations. How is it that people of European descent can work in the stifling atmosphere of a ship's lower hold, stowing away cargo in tropical and sub-tropical ports, such as Cairns and Cooktown and Townsville ? This is very heavy work indeed. But not only do white men do it, but they are glad to get it to do, and come back for it whenever they get a chance. Why? Because they are paid a decent wage for doing it. </para>

					<para>The foregoing interview furnishes some interesting food for thought, and my old friend will, I suppose, attribute the fact that some of us may, on the same data, arrive at conclusions different from his, to the mere bigotry of the southerner. Now, just by way of setting off his view, and those of the planters whose experiences I gave last week, let me now, in this impartial series of statements, present the other side, as put by a Cairns man with whom I talked. </para>
					<para>"You must always recollect," he said, "that this is an out-of-the-way sort of place, and that it is not easily get-at-able. If it were otherwise, or, since we cannot well recast the continent, if travelling were easier and less expensive, we could draw upon the southern cities for the additional labour needed in the busy sugar season, and things would be different. Do not believe half you near about white men being unable to do the work. Why, the very whites who say it are themselves amongst the hardest workers in the district, and you do not find them delicate looking, do you ?" </para>
					<para>"No, indeed, they're what the complimentary inspecting officer would declare to be ' a very fine body of men.' " </para>
					<para>"Precisely, and they do the hard work." </para>
					<para>" But they trash not, neither do they cut cane." </para>
					<para>" Not while they can get niggers to do these things for them."</para>
					<para>#34; But wouldn't they prefer to give employment to men of their own race ? Blood is usually supposed to be thicker than water."</para>
					<para>"Yes, that is a very good and time-honoured idea - sometimes true, occasionally false - but since you deal in aphorisms perhaps you have heard one which declares that ' business is business ' ?" </para>
					<para>" The figure does seem somewhat familiar." </para>
					<para>" Somewhat ! Well, I'll let your modification pass. The point really is that in this work-a-day world 'business is business' with these planters, and whatever they may pretend to the contrary, the kanaka is cheap - ' cheap and nasty,' in fact, if we are to have a general parade of hackneyed figures of speech. I know the country well, have lived in it for years - for my sins, I suppose - and it is just beastly in the summer months. But most of us, British-like, get about and do our business all the year round, and it is hard work for whites as well as for blacks in the sugar season. I know whites can cut and load cane - I haven't seen any of them trashing - and if they care to stick to it would go through the season. Not, however, when there's anything better on, when there's good work on the wharves, as happens in the sugar season, and men can make i'4 or £5 a week, or when a new rush is heard of." </para>

					<para>In the pearl-shelling industry, organized capitalism having driven out white labour with cheap coloured divers, found itself the victim of the black and yellow capitalists competition. At once Parliament interfered to prohibit the person of colour from owning a pearl-shelling boat. All the pathos about how the Christian faith makes no distinction between the white man and the coloured specimen at once dried up. </para>

					<para>The rich man who is so shocked at the selfishness of the poor man in wanting to shut out cheap Asiatic competition, found the Asiatic competing with himself and promptly forbade him by Act of Parliament. And, then, having forcibly suppressed Asiatic competition as directed against his own personal interests, he went on being shocked at the poor man's selfishness in just the same old way. Now he wants to shut out the Asiatic from being a boss planter, because in that capacity he will interfere with the fat man's interests, and at the same time his attitude of Christian surprise because the white worker also objects to the Asiatic interfering with his interests is in as good repair as ever. </para>

					<para>The moral phase of the kanaka question is in itself a subject big enough for a series of articles, and I can only pretend here to touch upon a few of its features. I have said that the frequent stories of cruelty, ill-feeling, &amp;c, are either wholly untrue or exaggerated, but that does not alter the fact that the black traffic is only thinly disguised slavery. </para>

					<para>The cry is purely and simply a dodge to secure delay. Are we going to allow the traffic to continue for all time or are we going to abolish it? If we are prepared to abolish it in seven or ten years' time, as asked by some, why should we not abolish it in five years' time? In fact I would ask, why not abolish it at once, because I freely admit that the Bill allows a greater time for the gradual abolition of the traffic than I had anticipated. If the abolition of kanaka labour five years hence, is going to ruin the industry, then it will ruin it in seven years' time. The truth is that the people who are crying out for an extension of time, believe that if their request is granted they will be able in the meanwhile to keep on agitating, and to bring fresh pressure to bear on members of this Parliament so that their beloved kanaka will be left to them for all time, and they will not have to say every morning, as no doubt some of them do at present - " Oh, Lord, give us this day our daily kanaka." </para>

					<para>I do not. In view of the honorable senator's interjection I would ask, what better time could we have for doing away with kanaka labour than the present, when we have another measure to be brought before us shortly in connexion with which such a Bill as this must be considered ? I refer to the Tariff. I think it was clearly shown by an honorable senator on the other side of the House, whose statement has not been contradicted, that the preference made by the Tariff in favour of sugar grown entirely by white labour over that grown by black labour, will undoubtedly make up for the cost of substituting white for black labour. During the last few months I have endeavoured to get at the bottom of this question. I have sought to learn whether the work can be done by white men, and whether, if it can be done by them, they are willing to do it. Since the introduction of the Tariff I have also endeavoured to ascertain whether the increase'd cost to which the planters will be put in substituting white for black labour will be made up to them under the Tariff proposals, and I have come to the conclusion that I cannot vote for or support any extension of the time within -which it is proposed under this Bill that kanaka labour shall cease. I come now to another and a higher aspect of the whole question. It is all very well to say that this is merely a business question ; but we know that it is a duty which devolves upon the men who have been sent here from all parts of Australia at the commencement of our national life, to pass laws under which the people by whom they were returned will be protected.</para>

I am proud to be able to look at this question in a broad national light, and to have the opportunity of joining in building up in Australia a state of affairs which posterity will not be ashamed of, and for which our children, and our children's children, will thank us.

					<para>- The comparison falls to the ground, because figures from the same source prove that only twelve white people per 1,000 die under the same conditions. This includes women and children. While in the case I have mentioned the offender would be indicted for murder, we deliberately allow the South Sea Islanders to enter Queensland, well knowing that the system is nothing but legalized murder. We also know that the islands are being depopulated, and that it is merely a matter of time when the kanaka race will die out in consequence of this depopulation. Therefore, not only in the interest of the kanaka, but also in the interest of the people of Australia, we ought not to countenance a traffic of this description. Under the circumstances, I feel constrained to vote for the measure introduced by the Government. I regard it as a just measure, and one that meets all the points that ought to be dealt with.</para>

					<para>- They must be separated. It is not fair to the Senate that we should have these two questions - particularly that in relation to the fiscal issue - connected with and inextricably mixed up with that of kanaka labour. The Bill raises a specific question which must be dealt with, and which I propose to deal with, on its merits, irrespective of the general question of the exclusion of alien or undesirable persons and irrespective of any fiscal issue whatever. I consider that we must deal with the subject from a higher platform than that of any suggested bargain by which a particular class of the community, the consumers of sugar, are to pay for the expulsion of the kanaka. We can deal with it on a broader and a better platform than that. In the first place, so far as regards the general &gt; question of a white Australia, we are nearly all Of us agreed that Australia is peculiarly fitted to be the home of the British race. Speaking generally, we are agreed that if if is possible we should make Australia the resort and the home of ourselves, of our children, and of all of the same blood who choose to come here - especially, I would say, of all of the same blood. I do not extend it even to other white races. I am, and always have been, an advocate of keeping Australia - I would not limit it to Australians only - for those of British blood, so far as we possibly can. The Government have wisely recognised that this question is one to be determined apart from the general question of a white Australia. In the Bill now before the Senate, the kanaka traffic is treated as outside the general policy of alien immigration. It is expressly excepted from the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Bill, and is made the subject of a special measure. The fiscal question is not before us. It is impossible for us to deal with it. This Bill does not rest in any respect on any fiscal bargain that is to be made between the Commonwealth and the planter.</para>

I know quite well that in cases of emergency and in cases of extreme necessity an Englishman will go anywhere and do anything.

					<para>- Instead of . the death rate of 12 per 1,000, we should have a death rate of 50 per 1,000 in those circumstances. If there is a death rate of 30 per 1,000 among the kanakas now working in the sugar-fields, owing to the climate, and if these people are an inferior race, I prefer that they should suffer that extreme death rate rather than my own countrymen. That is a vast question which we cannot settle now, but which, I think, it is important we should bear in mind before we speak rashly, and before we arrive at any final determination in regard to this question, beyond the absolute necessity of the case as it concerns kanaka labour in the sugar industry of Queensland. Sooner or later we shall have to face the question of whether the tropical part of our country is to be doomed to perpetual barrenness - is to remain a desert - or whether we shall have exceptional legislation, or exceptional arrangements with regard to particular occasions that may happen to arise.

When the time comes to consider the development and the populating of tropical Australia, we shall have to keep our minds open in determining how far we should go in that direction, and under what conditions we should undertake it. We are dealing now with one exceptional case and that is the condition of things in Queensland in regard to a particular industry that exists there, and which is affected by this particular measure. It seems to me that we should do well to confine our attention to the specific object of this measure, and the proposal itself as affecting Queensland. That being the case we are faced at the outset with this situation. Queensland has sent a majority of representatives - a majority of five to one - to the Senate pledged, I understand, to put an end to kanaka labour.</para>

I have read it, however, and I gathered from it that the telegram referred to a meeting. Certainly it spoke with great force and strength. It is a remarkable fact that, so far as I am aware, we have not had any representations on the other side of the question. There is another point to be considered. I admit that this is a question of time and terms. So far as these terms are concerned, I am not aware that whilst the people of Queensland have expressed themselves on the principle in regard to the necessity of determining kanaka labour, they have expressed themselves as to the terms or the time which should be given to the planters to enable them to get rid of that class of labour. I have been listening, and the reason why I did not speak earlier was that I might hear the views of other honorable senators, and get information. I have not heard it put forward here that there was any issue, and I have not heard the conditions stated of any issue as to the terms on which, and the time at which, the kanakas should go.</para>

					<para>The number of white cultivators has been increasing year by year, and the number of black auxiliaries decreasing at a corresponding rate. Nothing has gone so much to foster this tendency as the continuation and extension of the central mill system. ..... Probably if the industry were left to the Queensland Parliament to regulate, in another decade the central mill system would be all but universal, and Queensland would in time present the unique spectacle of cane-sugar being grown on a vast scale by innumerable white cultivators with the help of an insignificant number of blacks. If anything is more remarkable than the expansion of the sugar industry between 1893 and 1901, it is the ever-increasing number of whites and the ever-diminishing number of blacks engaged in it during that period, a phenomenon unparalleled in the history of cane-growing. Those who have observed this phenomenon were not without hope that within a generation the regime under which sugar is produced by whites and blacks in combination would give place to a regime under which sugar would be produced by whites alone, and they noted with satisfaction that the race which would be indispensable during the transition stage was the one subject race that need not be dreaded as a competitor, or as a contaminator of our own people. </para>

					<para>- Not at all. It may be that the consequence of having Chinese, or kanakas, or Hindoos, or other undesirable people amongst us, is to give opportunities for obtaining cheap labour to employers, but that is a mere consequence of alien immigration ; it is one of the evils which we all admit, and which, if possible, we wish to put an end to. But our power to legislate with regard to the exclusion of kanakas is exactly the same power as we are going to exercise with regard to Chinese and Hindoos. We exercise it under subsection (27) of section 51, which hands over to the Commonwealth Parliament the control of immigration and emigration. What is this Bill ? It is a Bill presented to Parliament under that power. It deals with immigration. It is a Bill to prohibit a certain section of people who have to be specially dealt with, because of the interests which have grown up in connexion with them.</para>

In the argument in favour of the substitution of white labour for. kanaka labour, it is freely admitted that in Bundaberg it can be done. The Bundaberg district is the district of the small farmer, and it is admitted that many of the small farmers work their farms without kanakas. If that is not admitted, and it is said that Bundaberg and the other places are on the same footing, then by all means give them the same extension of time at Bundaberg.</para>

The whole matter is, therefore, open to us, and it is for us to say whether that compromise is fair and just, or whether it is not one which we should alter in the interests of this great industry. Conceding the principle, I should have been glad if we could have had a committee of inquiry upon details, not as to whether the kanaka should go, because upon that I believe the final word for the present has been spoken. I should have been glad for two reasons to have had a committee of inquiry. First, we have been endeavouring to deal with complicated details and wide considerations, many of which have been submitted to us by honorable senators in strings of figures more or less interesting, and it is impossible for us to do them that full justice which we should like without an inquiry into the matter</para>

					<para>- I have not the figures, but I am told that some 4,000 out of the 8,000 odd kanakas employed in the industry have been in Queensland some for six years, and some for longer. If that is true, I believe that to pass a summary provision of this kind for the deportation of those people would do them an inhuman injustice. I can conceive that many of those people, after living for years away from their islands, may, when they are returned to them, find themselves alienated from their relatives, friends, or tribes. They may be exposed to injuries and ill-treatment from which we shall be powerless to protect them. I say that is a grave consideration. I am not going to dwell upon it, but I say that we ought not to forget the kanakas themselves in this connexion. So far as the planters and farmers and others connected with the industry are concerned, no inquiry is necessary, in my judgment, to induce us to be fair. We ought indeed to be more than fair. We ought to be generous. Surely the members of this Senate will not seek to deal out their fate to the planters and farmers with an iron hand ? Let us deal tenderly with them. What wrong have they done that they should be brought in peril in regard to this industry?</para>

					<para>- Yes, there is no pleasing my friends, the antikanakas. I am not seeking to retain the kanaka, only I want fair terms for my fellow citizens in Queensland in respect of the pursuits in which they have embarked their fortunes. Assuming that they are in the minority, and assuming that they have to declare that the majority have spoken, and that representative government is government by the majority, still the minority has to be considered in the terms. The fiat of the majority is that the kanaka must go, and the minority say - because it is boiled down to this - " Let us have fair terms. Let us have sufficient time to get rid of our stocks and machinery if we are to be seriously prejudiced and must submit." I 'say let us ' be generous in the terms we give them. That is a fair thing, and surely one year or two years, more or less, is nothing in this connexion. There are 8,000 kanakas engaged in this great industry in Queensland, where there is a population, I think, approaching half-a-million.</para>

					<para>- Really, is it not absurd when these planters - interested people if you like; people who want to benefit pecuniarily by this trade - say to us, " Give us two or three years more ; we recognise that the kanaka must go," that we should rule them with a rod of iron and say " Not an hour"? I say it is unjust and unworthy of the Federal Parliament to take up such a position. What then do we find ? Nothing could be more interesting than the historical account of this question given by the Postmaster-General. In 1885 the Queensland State Legislature, affected by the same facts as affect us now, gave them eight years in order to get rid of kanaka labour. Surely we might at least allow them the same period ?</para>

					<para>- But they did not carry that out. The people and Parliament of Queensland could not. We have heard it said that this Bill is to be the final word on the subject. If it is not to be so, what is the use of passing it? Every one, even the man interested in retaining the kanaka perpetually, agrees that the kanaka must go. Should we regard this as the final measure, the question is what time must be given for the change? It is said that if we had fixed the term within which the traffic should cease at two years, the planters would have asked for three, or if we had fixed it at ten years, they would have asked for twenty years. That is merely trifling with the question. The real question is, what is a fair time to allow under this Bill ? Another consideration that has to be borne in mind is that there can be no doubt whatever - and one reads of it with a good deal of pain - that there is a strong expression of discontent that the Federal Parliament at the outset of its career should be legislating in this particular way, in face of the entreaties for fair and liberal treatment by those who are most intimately affected by it. I ask the Senate to consider that aspect of the question. Let us not, on the threshold of our union, promote discontent or hostility in any section of the community. If we can we ought to avoid making any section, whether small or great, repent of having come into this federation. We ought not, if we can possibly avoid it, to implant any seeds "of bitterness in the breasts of any section of the community in any State whether large or small. My own belief is, reading as I do of what has . happened in the Queensland Parliament, and what is to be found in the documents which have been brought under our notice by different bodies in Queensland, that there will be a very strong feeling created if we are not generous in our treatment of this question. It is worth while, whatever our opinions may be, to give these people another two or three years, in order that the object may be achieved in a conciliatory and tactful manner. Why should we risk ill-feeling towards the federal union and discontent for the mere sake of another year or two to get rid of the kanakas ? On that ground I appeal to honorable senators most strongly. With me this is no party question. I am expressing my own views. The principle of the measure is altogether undoubted. The necessity for a committee of inquiry, I think, most of us feel has passed by. I should have been glad of it as to details, but no committee of inquiry can be necessary in order to stimulate us to do what is fair and just. If it is thought that what is proposed is more than fair and more than just, then let it be generous if you will. I shall assist in amending the Bill so as to give a reasonable extension of time for the discontinuance of kanaka labour, and, if possible, according to the three zones I mentioned. I shall do so in the hope that we shall thereby achieve the object we all have in view with the least possible disturbance to a great national industry. I think that we can achieve it with equal success by making some such concessions as I have indicated, and at the same time do no hurt that it is possible to avoid to those of our fellow citizens who have invested their money and expended their energy in a great enterprise which has been of immense value to Queensland, and which will yet be of great value to the whole Commonwealth.</para>

					<para>- Honorable senators are taking the Constitution exactly in the same way as they take a Bill. Probably they have never read the Bill, but when they come to a certain clause they take it as one of a lot of nine pins they have to hammer at, irrespective of anything else in the Sill. I have found them doing that very often. They do the same thing very often in connexion with the Constitution. Every Constitution is not an aggregation of sections, but it is a complete whole, and one part of it depends on the other as much as one member of a family depends on another.</para>

Honorable senators will see that the difference between the wages of the kanaka and the white man in the Bundaberg district is £35. The difference between the wages of the white worker and the kanaka in the Mackay district is £45, and the difference in the Cairns district is £55.

					<para>- But they went and got it all the same ; 523 of them went and got those blocks, and are already settled in that district, and that is why there are more acres to the single settler in the Cairns district than in the district of Mackay. The same thing applies in connexion with the Tweed River. It was settled first, and of course, as the settlement there is denser, the land is dearer. It is always from the centre of population that the areas of land increase, whether in a hot climate or in a cold climate, and so in the Bundaberg district, being close to the centre, the settlement would be denser, and districts farther away from the centre would be more sparsely populated. This shows conclusively to my mind that the argument that it is not a very good place to settle in is an idle one. The very fact that 523 people have settled there successfully, and that 202 of them have been able to carry on without the aid of kanakas should disprove that statement.</para>

					<para>- It does not matter whether they are black or white, because the climate of Japan is decidedly a temperate one. If the natives of Japan can come down and work in the Cairns district, the natives of Great Britain, who are as good men as ever they were, and better in my opinion, can come down and work in the ' same place, and there is no climatic influence that will affect one which will not affect the other.
