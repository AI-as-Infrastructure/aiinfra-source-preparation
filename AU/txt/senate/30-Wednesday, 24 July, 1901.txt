                    <para>- I desire to ask the Postmaster - General a question without notice. Is the honorable and learned senator aware that signatures are being solicited in Sydney to a petition against a provision of the Post and Telegraph Bill conferring power on the Postmaster-General to decline to deliver letters addressed to sweep promoters, and that those signatures are being solicited on the ground that the petition is one to prevent the Postmaster-General from tampering with letters? </para>

                <para>SenatorDRAKE. - I have heard, though not officially, thai there is a movement on foot not only in New South Wales, but in other States, to obtain signatures to a petition with regard to the Post and Telegraph Bill. I do not know what inducements may be offered to persons to sign the petitions, but I may say, with regard to the clause relating to letters in that Bill, that there is no power asked for which is not contained in the Postal. Acts of the various States. </para>

                    <para>I shall now state the circumstances and facts upon which that report is founded. It appears that the election which is disputed took place on the 29th March. The return to the writ, as will appear from the writ itself, was made on the 18th April, and on the 23rd May a petition was lodged with the Clerk. I am assuming for the present that the electoral law of Western Australia has some application to the procedure which takes place on these petitions. As I shall point out by-and-by, I think it is very questionable indeed whether the procedure regulating the presenting of and dealing with petitions under that law, in reference to the tribunal which was specially established there, has anything to do with the procedure which is to be followed in bringing a petition relating to a disputed election before the Senate. But I am assuming for the moment that the procedure may be applied. Section 146 of the State Electoral Act of 1899 is the section which more particularly deals with this matter. In Western Australia there is a Court of Disputed Returns, consisting of two Judges of the Supreme Court. That court deals with all questions of disputed elections, and practically finally decides all questions that are referred to it - following the law of the House of Commons in Great Britain, and of other places. Now, the procedure to be followed in bringing a petition before the Court of Disputed Returns is set forth in section 146- </para>

                            <para>- If there was any necessity for any other instructions the committee could have done what other committees have done - come back to the Senate for further instructions. I was saying that the Senate having this power, and having referred the matter to the committee, has left it entirely in the hands of the Senate. In what terms was the committee appointed to act? As honorable senators are aware, there being no election law governing procedure in reference to petitions presented to this House in regard to disputed elections - there being only the section of the Constitution which makes the Senate the judge of disputed elections, it became necessary to appoint some tribunal to take evidence, and deal with the question. That was not, however, absolutely essential, because it was quite open to the Senate to do what I understand is done sometimes in the House of Representatives in America - to have the question decided by the House itself, there being simply a committee appointed to take evidence, which has to be produced to the House. But it appeared to me, who moved the motion - and I assume it appeared also to the Senate who carried it - that it would be very undesirable to have discussions as to disputed elections taking place in the House itself; and that inasmuch as there was no tribunal constituted by law to deal with the matter, the best plan was to constitute a tribunal by resolution of the Senate which could as far as possible take all the proceedings which ought to be taken outside this Senate itself, and report to the Senate the result of those proceedings. </para>

Therefore the Senate deliberately, instead of making the committee a body to decide this question by itself, which of course the Senate might have done, appointed a committee with certain duties, and certain duties only. The committee was appointed in these terms - </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly ; I have no doubt the Senate would interfere if they thought there was very strong ground for the view that the committee had given a wrong judgment upon the matter. I do not say that the Senate would not be entitled to do that, but what I do say is that the Senate would not lightly enter upon the consideration of the accuracy of the committee's report on any question of fact. A different state of things altogether has arisen here. The committee have declined to go into the facts. The committee which was appointed to inquire into and report have determined, upon their view of the law of Western Australia, that they are not entitled to go into the question, and, therefore, they have practically decided and reported . to the Senate that the petitioner cannot be heard before this House. They have decided that the petitioner has no right to have his claims considered by us. When the committee come to a conclusion of that sort, it must on every ground be examinable by the Senate, which is the fountain of authority, which gives the committee its power, and to which the committee must report. When the report denies a hearing by a committee of the Senate to the petitioner, it is only right that we should have an opportunity of saying whether that denial is on proper grounds ; whether it is upon grounds which do justice in law to the petitioner, and which are consistent with the power which this House ought to have and must have with regard to any question of disputed returns. If the laws of the different States, applicable to elections, are to be applied here, it is quite evident that in regard to many of the States it would be impossible to petition the Senate at all. These laws of the different States tare always open to amendment, and it would be possible for any State to amend its electoral laws in such a way that it would be practically impossible for any elections to be challenged before this House. It must therefore be perfectly obvious that the Senate has a right to inquire into the report of the committee, and to express an opinion which shall be a guide to the committee. We have a right to send this petition back to the committee for further inquiry and report. What is the position ? If I may sum it up in a few words, it is this : My view, and the view which I ask the Senate to take, is that there is no justification whatever for the report of the committee that the electoral law of Western Australia prevents them from hearing the petition. In my opinion, it does not prevent the committee from hearing the petition. In the first place, the electoral law of Western Australia cannot apply to the circumstances here. In the second place, the law of Western Australia can only be applied as far as practicable, and applying it as far as practicable to this case we find that it has been complied with in every possible way by the petitioner. The electoral law of Western Australia does not apply to prevent the petitioner from being ' heard. That being so, it is the duty of the Senate at the earliest moment to express that opinion, and with that expression of opinion, to send the petition back to the committee for further inquiry and report, so that the committee shall be in a position to hear any evidence that may be called, and to decide the question upon its merits. I have moved this motion because while I have no knowledge whatever of the merits of this petition - nor do I care what they are - it appears to me that it would not be consistent with the position which the Senate ought to take up in regard to disputed returns to adopt a report of this kind, or even to allow it to be laid upon the table of the House without taking the action which is necessary - first of all to inform the committee of the opinion of the Senate in regard to the question of law which is to be raised, and in the second place for further inquiry and report in order that the petitioner may have his rights, and in order also that the rights of the Senate may be maintained. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned senator's interruptions are so inappropriate, and so recoil on himself that he had better not interrupt me any more. He had charge of this motion. He put it on the paper. Did the Vice-President of the Executive Council rob him of it, or did he take it with the consent of the honorable and learned senator? Surely there could be no more cogent evidence of the combination between these two honorable and learned senators. </para>

I suppose he took it from his pocket. I did not see any other place from which it could come. He read the judgment to the committee there and then, immediately the arguments were finished.

                            <para>- The Act of Parliament of Western Australia. As I have said, so far as my own opinion is concerned, I hold that the Act and practice of Western Australia have no application whatever. The committee never said so for a moment. But there was no practice, and no procedure. The Senate might have adopted - and I venture to think it was the duty of the Vice-President of the Executive Council when he moved in this matter, to have formulated - sessional orders governing the limitation of time within which petitions should be presented, and the procedure that should have been adopted. That has been done in every instance with which I am acquainted, and whatever the practice is which is adopted by the House, or followed by the party, it should be rigidly adhered to. Honorable senators will find that all these questions are to be determined by the committee. It was sand, and this was the only answer made to the preliminary objections offered, that the committee had not to decide them. The preliminary objections are all matters to be dealt with by the committee. The presentation of the petition is a mere matter of course when it comes up before the House. The practice is rigid, as honorable senators will find in Sharkey's little book on parliamentary petition. At page 34 they will find that as to the time within which petitions should be presented - </para>

                    <para>The practice of Parliament is strict in this respect. </para>
                    <para>And an instance is given of very grave hardship, it would seem ; but still, an instance of the rigid application of the rule - </para>
                    <para>A petition being delivered to the Clerk on the evening of the day on which the fourteen days expired, but after the House was up, though circumstances might have warranted a relaxation of the rule, the petition was not received. But if the House did not meet, or having met, did not proceed with business on the fourteenth day, petitions have been received on the next day of its sitting. </para>
                    <para>And with a view to preventing any difficulty the time has sometimes been extended. Now here is what we have before us. We have the preliminary objections taken by the respondent's counsel - first, that the petition was not presented within the 40 days; secondly, that if presented it was not referred to the court - or the substitute, of course, for the court, whatever was the appropriate tribunal - within 10 days. I may point out to the Senate that as matters at present stand, unless we have some directness of application in regard to practice, no honorable senator is safe from the presentation of a petition, at any time, challenging his seat. </para>

                            <para>- My honorable friend has asked a very pertinent and proper question. It was the fault of the petitioner. It is the petitioner who has the conduct of his own petition. It is he, according to parliamentary practice, who has got to be diligent and to be active. The Senate is not to blame, and the only answer that was suggested with regard to the petitioner to excuse him for what were admitted laches on his part was that the Senate was to blame. I deny that the Senate was to blame. It is for the petitioner to move the Senate, and he cannot shelter himself, under an accusation against the Senate, against the consequence of his own want ofdiligence. </para>

                            <para>- The Senate has nothing to do with petitions until they are presented. It is the right of every man to petition, but election petitions are quite different things. Election petitions are proceedings by one man against another. These are in the same position as a litigation by one man against another. The plaintiff or the petitioner has to see that his litigation - there is no better word to use - is conducted with diligence if he wishes it conducted, and I am told that the petitioner was informed by the Clerk that it was necessary that he should have his petition presented by an honorable senator. Why was it not presented? On the 27th June the Vice-President of the Executive Council finds this petition, gathers up this foundling, and presents it. The committee felt - and it is obvious - that the petitioner, knew it was necessary that his petition should be presented by a member of the Senate. When my honorable and learned friend moved that the petition be received, he said - </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps it ought to have been done before : but I venture to think that my honorable and learned friend is a little too Quixotic, is driving the doctrine in regard to petitions a little too far, when he applies that observation to an election petition. I deny that it has any application to an election petition. It is for the active party who is challenging the seat of the sitting member to bring that petition on with the utmost expedition, and the facts show that instead of expedition there was the grossest neglect and the grossest delay, and it was a delay, moreover, which went beyond the time specified in the practice which the petitioner had adopted, fixed by the Act of Parliament of Western Australia. The ground of the decision of the committee was not the bald ground that the petition was left with the Clerk; but that the leaving with the Clerk was not treated by the petitioner or by any one else as a presentation within the meaning of the Western Australian law which they had adopted, and that a presentation by an honorable senator was essential. That presentation by an honorable senator was gratuitously undertaken by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and for the reasons which he stated, but that was out of time. The committee decided upon that ground in the first place, and then the second point was taken. Moreover, the petition when it came before us, I ought to point out, was marked as received by the Senate on the 27th June, 1 901 . That was the date according to which . the period of 40 days should be computed, and the date which the committee, in the exercise of its judgment, was entitled to deem, and did deem, to be the date of the presentation to the Senate, and following the rule held the petitioner to the practice which he had himself adopted. They could come to no other conclusion than that he was out of time. After a prolonged and anxious investigation, after long and elaborate arguments by counsel on both sides, they came to that conclusion, and it was embodied in the report and signed by the Chairman and presented to the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- No ; at any rate we came to the conclusion that it was not an actual presentation and that the petitioner had abandoned that leaving with the Clerk, as a presentation to the State. The presentation to the Senate was that made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council on the 27th June, and if there was anything in the leaving of the petition with the Clerk, that was entirely superseded and done away with by the subsequent presentation. </para>

                            <para>- Because the petitioner adopted what the Vice-President of the Executive Council did. That is what we had before us, and having adopted that as the presentation to the Senate there was an end to the whole question. He knew perfectly well that he was out of court. What he trusted to was that this was one of the things to which the practice was not applicable, that so long as he had got his petition presented and referred to a committee he considered that was sufficient. That is really what the line of difference was - that he was at liberty to pick and choose as to what was practicable and what was not, and the only answer that was offered with regard to these objections was that it was the fault of the Senate, that it should have taken up the matter and conducted the petition as the prosecutor, and it was responsible if anything went wrong with it. All this practice was laid down with the view of making people diligent and expeditious in the assertion of these rights. We must look at what the position is. As my honorable and learned friend says, these States are widely apart. We know that investigation may go on. for months owing to all the difficulties of obtaining evidence and so on. These investigations also, if petitions are presented, may be initiated at any moment if there are no regulations, as there are not, made by the Senate. If there are no regulations, then the tribunal which is chosen for the Senate with the view of dealing with these matters has to do the best it can. This tribunal did the best it could. It investigated the whole matter from every point of view. It dealt with the practice which the parties had adopted; it dealt with the matter from the point of view of the diligence with which these proceedings ought to have been carried out, and after all the investigation had taken place adjourned the hearing, so that no - hasty conclusion should be arrived at. The committee then concluded as is embodied in the report, and the petitioner's counsel anticipating that that was the and of the matter, as he was entitled to do, asked for a recommendation that the deposit should be returned. Now. we are face to face with a position which practically carries back the proceedings with regard to controverted parliamentary elections to the time of 150 years and more ago. We know quite well that the whole object in appointing a body apart from the House of Parliament itself is to secure that, whether they are right or whether they are wrong, they decide the matter according to the material before them, in the best way that is possible. We believe that our decision is absolutely right ; but whether it be right or whether it be wrong it is infinitely better that it should be affirmed than" that, following the iniquitous practice of old, it should be brought before the Senate and determined perhaps on a party vote or according to the feeling of individual senators, which cannot altogether be suppressed. AVe have nothing to gain by such a matter as this. All that can possibly happen is that we shall be introducing the practice in connexion with this petition - I hope for no other - of bringing clown to the floor of the Senate the determination of these questions. AVe had, hundreds of years ago, corruption and abuse of the worst kind. AVe know that so long ago as 1770, with the view of preventing these inquiries from being conducted on the floor of the House, Lord Grenville's Act was passed to remit them to a committee. The committees then appointed, strangely enough, were too large, and were affected by the same vices as affected the House of Commons itself. And so reform went on from time to time, until, in 1839, a great improvement was made in the way these committees were constituted ; and . finally, in 1868, came the salutory provision referring these election petitions, together with all preliminary question's of law and fact, to a Judge, or, as it is in my own State, to a Judge sitting with members in the nature of assessors. But who would ever believe that, supposing a tribunal of that kind had arrived at a wrong conclusion upon a preliminary objection as to the right of a petitioner I to have his petition heard, that that would be brought up on the floor of the House for debate ? Yet that is the situation here. My honorable and learned friend admits that on matters of fact no such thing could be contemplated as the question being overhauled or debated in the Senate. It would be a deplorable thing for that to be done. </para>

                    <para>It has been properly observed that a select committee is the legitimate tribunal before which objections to both the form and the substance of petitions ought now to be taken ; and that any attempt to restore the old practice of discussing controverted elections and returns in the House is an infringement of the Grenville Act, and a violation of the present constitution of Parliament. </para>
                    <para>An election petition, relating to the same transaction, was pending, which would necessarily bring that transaction before a judicial tribunal of the House - a select committee ; and it had been the policy of the Legislature, ever since the Grenville Act, to take from the jurisdiction of the House at large all matters connected with elections, and refer them to a more impartial tribunal. </para>

                    <para>No one can doubt the inherent and inalienable right of the House of Commons ; while all must own the serious inconvenience which was acknowledged by the former to exist, viz.., almost unavoidably anticipating and prejudicing a pending grave judicial inquiry by a tribunal constituted by members of this House. Without further discussing the matter, it may be observed that the ends of justice, and the purity and dignity of Parliament might have been deemed effectually secured by giving precedence to the judicial inquiry by the select committee, before whom all the facts might have been satisfactorily elicited, and on oath. </para>

                            <para>- I hope my honorable and learned friend will in the future try to reconcile himself to being in a minority. He is responsible for this. I do not envy him if he succeeds in getting the Senate to pass this vote pf censure on its own tribunal. He will not cause any inconvenience or uneasiness, I am certain, to the members of the majority on the committee. I am sorry some of the members of the committee are not present to-day. That shows the inconvenience of our not having proper notice of what is going to take place. But I am satisfied - and I do not wish to make too much of these matters of unfairness - that the effect of these proceedings is to censure the majority of the committee, of whom I happen to be one. I am proud of the position I took up. I should decide in the same way again to-morrow. But if we are to maintain the purity and dignity of Parliament, if we are to uphold that procedure in reference to elections petitions, which is only effective by means of the choice of a tribunal winch will endeavour to determine the issues brought before it without fear or favour, then the duty of the Senate- is to back up the committee, and when they have come to a conclusion, not to support the minority. While, as I say, I do not envy the Vice-President of the Executive Council or the Chairman of the Committee if he supports this motion, my fear is a great one that the . carrying of the motion will not only be to censure the committee, but to expose the Senate to damaging animadversions' reflecting on the I position of a committee of its own choosing - a committee which has, at any rate, striven earnestly and anxiously, and after great deliberation, to do that which in its conscience it believed to be right. </para>

I urged, however, that we should not decide that night, but that we should sit next morning at half past nine and deal with the matter, so that in the meantime we would be able to think it over. Counsel for the petitioner then asked to have a further chance of arguing the point. He was told that a further chance would be given to him, and next morning he said something. In the meantime I did what any other judge ought to do. I attended to my work ; I looked into the case and wrote out the result of my' deliberations, nothing being said subsequently by counsel for the petitioner to alter m}' opinion. That is what occurred. The other members of the committee read their statement after I had read mine. </para>

                        <para>But the Act shows that it is not to extend to disputed elections, for section 47 says that "any question of a disputed election to either House shall be determined by the House in which the question arises." So the question of "a disputed" election has to "arise" in the House concerned, and at once all the procedure in reference to it under local laws is displaced. </para>
                        <para>Then what is the procedure? That is for the House concerned. That House may impose conditions as to deposit, or otherwise - whether the procedure by petition or motion should be adopted - but altogether what it pleases. </para>

I said that as the report was only the report of a bare majority I would consider, but I said nothing about letting the Senate know. There is no question about that. I was not going to let them know at the beginning, and lose my right of speaking. I am too old to be caught with chaff of that kind. I behaved absolutely ingenuously with my honorable and learned friend, and moved exactly as I had arranged. Many honorable senators suggested that I should move it, but I said certainly not, as 1 would be stultifying myself. All I said was that I would move that the report be received and . taken in to consideration on a certain date. </para>

                            <para>- Either with a view to adopting the report, or with a view of sending it back to us for. further consideration. There is the. whole question. It is rather serious for us. In this we have got to decide - does the Western Australia law apply? The Western Australia law creates certain offences, which shall be considered as offences against the electoral laws, and which shall invalidate an election. The same Act provides also for disputed elections, and for a court of two Judges to try and finally decide them. The Commonwealth Act provides that until the Commonwealth Parliament otherwise provides the laws of the several States relating to elections shall rule, and it is shown that this does not include disputed elections, because it is said in a subsequent section of the Constitution Act that disputed elections for either House shall be settled in the House in which the question arises. That is, in which the question of a disputed election arises. </para>

                            <para>- I know that honorable senators opposite all agree with that, but they do not agree in the way I like, and they do not agree consistently either. That being the point, and it being agreed that the Western Australia law does not apply, we have a committee appointed to inquire into and report upon a petition, and they recommend that the petition be dismissed. Why ?Because the law of Western Australia has not been complied with. It is admitted all round, that the law of Western Australia does not apply. Yet we have all kinds of imputations thrown upon us if we endeavour to interfere with the finding of the committee, who have said they have come to the conclusion that the petition should be dismissed because the law of Western Australia does apply, when they themselves get up and say that they cannot contend for a moment that it has any application. </para>

We now have it that the deposit has been made, the petition is with the Clerk, duly signed and properly complying with the Act in all respects. Then comes section 147 - </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to forget it. I am trying to go by degrees,because I can assure the Senate that the attitude I am taking up in this matter is one that is dictated according to the principles of justice as they appear to me, and I am striving, perhaps unconsciously - though the effort is consciously made - to make justice fit in with the avoidance of a very dangerous precedent. The words of the Act are - within ten days after the same have been received be referred to the court. </para>

                            <para>- In Western Australia that section has always been taken to have this meaning - the petition is either presented in person to the House or is left with the Clerk within 40 days. Either does. It is for the House of- Parliament in Western Australia to refer the petition to the court ; and if the House does not refer it to the court within ten days the petition is annulled, and has no effect. </para>

                            <para>- That is the ground given, and I think that ground is correctly given, because from the way the committee looked at it and from the way I am arguing it they deemed the law as applicable against a man who himself chose it, and therefore they are justified in saying that " with these circumstances before us we dismissed the petition because the petitioner has not complied with the law of Western Australia." Honorable senators must remember that the committee do not say that the law of Western Australia was obligatory upon the petitioner. </para>

                            <para>- The committee recognised the position that they could not deal, with the matter at all unless they had some procedure. They asked -the petitioner what .procedure he had adopted, and he said he had adopted the procedure of Western Australia. They then, I think, very wisely and justly said - " By no more fair procedure can we deal with you than that which you have adopted yourself." The report might be filled in in this way - </para>

                        <para>- I read with no little surprise the report of the committee, introducing as it did the electoral law of the State of Western Australia, and I waited with considerable interest to hear the discussion ' that would take place on it. We have had a very interesting discussion for and against the finding' of the committee, but the longer the discussion continues the more my surprise is increased at the action of the committee in introducing the reference to the law of Western Australia or of any other State. We have been told that the committee decided upon this case as they did because the petitioner, forsooth, took it upon himself to introduce his petition under the regulations observed in the State of Western Australia - the only law, I suppose, of which he had any knowledge whatever. If this is followed out it really means that whether the petitioner was right or wrong, was acting legally or illegally, and simply because he commenced his procedure under the Western Australian law, this Senate must, therefore, adopt that procedure, whether it be in accordance with the Constitution or against the Constitution. AVe have also been told that the Senate should on no account overrule the report of its committee. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator put it very nearly as strongly as I have done, but i confess that in this case the matter appears to me very clear. I was under the impression that the object which any House of Parliament has in referring a matter to a committee for inquiry and report, was to enable the committee to go into the details, which I quite agree the House is not qualified to do so satisfactorily. The committee then brings up a report, and the House deals with that report, and either accepts, rejects, or amends it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know how far the honorable and learned senator is right, but, personally, I do not see why there should be any difference in dealing with a Committee of Elections and Qualifications. There can be no question that the final determination in any case must lie with the Senate, and not with the Elections and Qualifications Committee, or any other select committee that may be appointed. We are told also that, because there was jio procedure laid down by the Senate, the committee was, therefore, justified in taking account of the procedure already commenced, incorrectly, I think, by the petitioner; but I venture to think it will not be contended that, because no procedure is laid down by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, we must, therefore, take the procedure of some other body. </para>

It is possible for any of us to make a mistake, and if I made a mistake and was told so, I should not consider it a Censure upon me. I should be inclined to look at the matter again and see if I was wrong. I am sure that the Senate has not the slightest intention of passing any censure on the committee, but I venture to think that the majority of the Senate will adopt the motion moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and return the petition to the committee. Then I think the committee will be perfectly right in dealing with the duty laid upon it, inquiring into the facts of the case, and reporting to the Senate, after which the Senate can deal with the matter. </para>

That being so, the grounds on which the petition has been objected to - that it is not in conformity with the law of Western Australia - does not apply. If that be the case the committee have been going on wrong lines. The committee have said that because the petitioner elected to be tried under the Western Australian Act they tried him under it.

                            <para>- If any mistake has been made, it has been made by the Senate, and we ought not to take advantage Â«Â©f our own laches. I think that is a good legal maxim. It is absurd to say that by upsetting this decision we shall be going back to those fearfully bad times when election petitions were always decided by parties. The Government, if they were strong enough, unmistakably ousted a man. who was appealed against, and actually the fate of Ministries has depended upon the effect of a disputed election return. I think that Walpole went out at last after fighting a hard battle when he found that one of his supporters, whose election was disputed, was, by a majority of the House, turned out of Parliament. We are not likely to go back to those times. We know that in a very short time the Government will bring in provisions providing for our own court of disputed elections, and for all matters appropriate and relating to elections for the Commonwealth Parliament. </para>

I shall do so with a certain amount of reluctance, because I admit that this is a thing that is not to be lightly undertaken. Having appointed a committee to inquire into a certain matter, and that committee having brought up a report, its decision is not to be lightly set aside, no matter what it may be. I think this case is such a clear one, however, and that we should commit such an act of injustice in the circumstances, if we did not set aside the report, that 1 feel compelled to vote for the Government in the circum-stances. </para>

                    <para>I am rather sorry the debate was not adjourned, because two of the majority of the committee are absent, and I am sure that if they were present a different complexion would be put upon this matter. That is why I moved the adjournment of the debate. Seeing that we have got to proceed, .1 may say that I differ with the majority of the honorable senators who have spoken, and who say that we have no line of procedure to go upon, and that we should not have adopted the practice prescribed by the "Western Australian Electoral Act. I can assure the Senate that the majority of the committee had that Act in their minds when they came to their decision, and they adopted as a basis of the procedure the electoral law of Western Australia. There is no other Act I am aware of upon which they could have based any opinion. We took sections 10 and 47 of the Constitution as giving us the right to follow the trend of the Western Australian Act, and as that Act had not been complied with in all its conditions, we considered we were well within our right in rejecting the petition, just as the House of Representatives had done in connexion with a somewhat similar condition of affairs. If the petition had been presented within the prescribed time I am sure there would have been no objection to going into all the pros and cons, but having found that the petition was not presented properly, we thought we were acting rightly in saying . that we could not go any further with it. It is unnecessary for me to quote the section of the 'Western Australian Act, which has already been referred to, but it says that a petition, after being laid in the hands of the Clerk, must within ten days be placed before the court. . Whose fault was it that the petition was not placed before the court before the Senate, or before the committee of the Senate? I hold that it was the fault of the petitioner himself. It was the duty of the petitioner to see that the various steps necessary to have- his petition considered were taken,. and having failed in that I hold that it was his fault and not the fault of any one else. There might be some impression that it was perhaps the fault of the Clerk of Parliaments, or perhaps the President of the Senate, or the leader of the Senate, but I do not think so. I think the fault lay with the petitioner. He failed to see that the various necessary steps were taken and the petition was not put before the committee within the time limit allowed. </para>

                        <para>-Col. NEILD (New South Wales). - It seems to me that this committee came to a decision, and I notice that there is no statement of the division. We hear to-day that there was a division in the committee, and that the matter was carried by one vote, but in the report of the proceedings of the committee, as was laid on the table of the Senate, there is no record of any vote. There is no evidence of any disagreement, and it appeal's to have been a unanimous decision. I was for many years a member of the Elections and Qualifications Committee in connexion with the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. The speeches made in the committee were, of course, not recorded; but the whole proceedings of the committee connected with divisions, at any rate, were recorded. That might have some, advantage, because it seems to me to be rather informal that members of a committee should be disclosing secrets of the committee which are evidently intended to be sacred, seeing that they are not to be found in the report furnished to the Senate. It seems to me that the matter that we are now asked to decide is a highly technical and difficult one, and I do not think that substantial justice is done in the matter of election committees if the finest technical points are seized upon to affect the giving of the decision which members of the Parliamentary Committee are sworn to give. I am not saying this by way of  casting any kind of reflection on the committee. 1 . </para>

                        <para>- It is certainly the duty of the committee, as I understand it, to deal with these matters so as to secure substantial justice rather than to deal with technicalities on which eminent lawyers differ. Eoi- instance, in this case we have two honorable and learned senators, both dignified by the title of King's Counsel, and they are absolutely at variance upon .the point. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a constitutional point, as I understand it ; it is a strictly legal point. However, there is this point that occurs to me. If the petition is thrown out, the petitioner fails to secure justice. On the other hand, there is no injustice necessarily done to the sitting member. He is not deprived of any right. The petitioner is deprived of the right on a highly technical ground, if his petition* is thrown out on that ground. I, therefore, think that it is in the interest of broad justice that an election petition should be dealt with rather on the merits than on technicalities. It is purely upon that ground that I shall give my vote for a reference of the matter again to the committee, in the hope that, in view of the discussion that has taken place to-day, when the committee does deal with the matter a second time, it will deal with it on bread grounds of equity rather than on the narrow ground of technicality. </para>

                        <para>- In justice to those honorable senators they should have had an opportunity of being here, to hear the reasons which have animated the leader of the Government in bringing forward this motion. It was certainly, unfair to them to allow- the question to come up for discussion without notice being given of it. I speak with some diffidence upon the subject, because it is one of a legal character, but I must express surprise at the opinion that has been so generally expressed that the petition in. dispute is not governed by the Western Australian Act. It seems to me that this case is on all fours with another case, not of a similar character exactly, but in which the Western Australian Electoral Act and the Constitution Act both partly apply. In . regard to the election of senators certain provisions are laid down in this Constitution. The electoral Acts of the various States provide the method of electing those senators : and in Western Australia the Electoral Act provides that there shall be a deposit of Â£25 for each candidate. The Constitution is absolutely silent as to any deposit being required from a candidate, but we know as a matter of fact that one candidate was nominated and did not bring forward a deposit, and the Crown, law authorities ruled that he was not eligible to be a candidate. </para>

                        <para>- I am willing to leave that point, although it is worthy of mention. The Senate is not now considering the question of overriding the decision of the committee, but is attempting by itself to decide what ought to have been done by the committee. I confess that, opposing this motion as I do, I have to combat many different arguments that in themselves are inconsistent with and contradictory of one another. It has been argued' by some honorable senators that this question of procedure ought not to be subject-to any consideration whatever. Indeed, some are prepared to argue, I believe, that the committee ought to have dispensed with procedure altogether. I think I heard one honorable senator say that the question of procedure should be entirely dispensed with. Let me apply such an argument to its full logical extent. If we dispense with all procedure, we, practically speaking, dispense with all conditions that every one will admit to be very necessary in the case of any person bringing a petition against a sitting member. We make it quite possible for any petition to be lodged against a sitting member without, ibr instance, the deposit of Â£50. The condition with regard to the deposit of Â£50 ls no more important than the other conditions that the committee recognise as distinct and necessary. I do not think I need pursue that argument further. I do not believe any one will support this motion for the reason that he is of opinion that the question of procedure should have been waived entirely. Assuming that every senator recognises that some procedure was necessary, what is the grievance in the present case? The grievance, in the minds of some honorable senators, is not that the petitioner in this case did not, but that he did actually comply with all the conditions. I want to take that point first, because I am perfectly certain that at this stage of the debate there are some honorable senators who are firmly convinced that the petitioner has complied with all the conditions that were adopted by the committee as necessary forms of procedure. </para>

                        <para>- I am obliged to the honorable and learned senator for his interruption, because it reminds me of something which I should have referred to at first. It has been urged that there is no reason why this procedure should have been adopted by the committee. I say that there is every reason, if the committee were to do anything at all, because they could do nothing whatever without some procedure. Some procedure was absolutely necessary. I can scarcely think that any honorable senator would, in a sane moment, gainsay such an argument as that. The committee would have been rendered absolutely powerless if it had not adopted some form of procedure. Finding that some sort of procedure had to be adopted, what did they do? They did no injury to the petitioner. They in no way wronged him. They recognised at once the form of procedure which the petitioner himself desired and actually had adopted. It was clear to the committee that the- petitioner, in all that he had done in order to get the petition before the Senate, had adopted the procedure of the "Western Australian Act. </para>

                        <para>- Section 146 says that the petitioner must, amongst other things, address his petition to the House affected, and that it must be presented by a member, or left with the Clerk within 40 days after the day of return. The fallacy that my honorable friends on the other side fall into is this - they use the word " Clerk " as it is used in the Western Australian Act to cover the same ground when applied to the Senate. If we follow' section 146, and go on to section 147, we shall find that something else has to be done: One of the necessary conditions in section 147 is that all petitions within ten days after the same have been received shall be referred to the court. </para>

                        <para>- I will not continue the debate with anything more of an interrogative nature, but I wish to remind the Senate of what is likely to happen when this matter is referred back to the committee. The committee has no form of procedure. The committee, I contend, cannot possibly settle this question with any sort of self respect ; it cannot approach the consideration of the question unless it has some form of procedure. Procedure means something more than a mere formality, and I think I shall be right in saying that it means that certain conditions will have to be recognised as conditions precedent to the hearing of the case. What procedure can the committee have that will enable it to lay down these conditions ? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not see the logical issue. He says we are refusing the petitioner a hearing ; but if he is granted a hearing now, when the committee have decided that he has not complied with certain provisions, I will ask the senator who interjects if he likes the position in which he will be placed? The position is this, that it will mean that we must allow any man, no matter what his grounds may be, or how ridiculous his claim may be, or how impossible it may be for him to prove his case, to lodge a petition, and we will compel the committee to hear it, and compel this Senate afterwards to consider the report of the committee, and accept or reject it. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad the honorable and learned senator has disavowed it, but 1 still think the question should have remained unasked. There is no member of the Senate who changes his opinion so often, or who is so. much like the chameleon as the honorable and learned senator himself. In this matter I have arrived at a certain conclusion, and I shall not change my opinion. I have spoken on this subject at greater length than I intended, yet I feel very strongly about it. My apology must be simply that I think it a matter of very great importance. I am sorry to see that there is a tendency on the part of many honorable senators to practically flout the committee, and to prefer the opinion of a minority. If we carry the motion it will place us in a position that must be painful to most of us, and it will tend to destroy the dignity of the Senate, and create a precedent that will be harmful in the future. The Senate is asked, on a legal question, to override the report of a committee especially selected to deal with the subject. That is a course that ought not to be taken without very grave reasons indeed, and I do not see that there are reasons in the present case which would justify such a proceeding. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, owing to the petitioner's fault. We are told that he did ask one or two honorable senators to present the petition. There are plenty of honorable senators who would have presented it if they had been requested to do so. </para>

                        <para>- The petition, would have been presented to the House if proper steps had been taken. These proper' steps were not taken. And now I understand that certain honorable senators wish us to overlook this failure on the part of the petitioner. They appeal to our sympathy to let the case go back again, because it has not been tried. They say, " Let it be tried, and let justice be done." The Senate is distinctly asked to do an injustice. If the case is to be dismissed in the House of Representatives, because the law of Western Australia has not been complied with,then the petition now before the Senate ought to be rejected, because there has also been failure in regard to it to comply with the law of Western Australia. </para>

                            Symon said so. This simply illustrates the variety to which I have referred.

                        <para>- I regret that he is not. It seemed to me that he was quite prepared to admit that lodgment with the Clerk was lodgment with the Senate. That was the impression that was conveyed to my mind by his argument. </para>

                        <para>- I followed the honorable and learned senator very closely, and endeavoured to draw his attention particularly to the argument as to the subsequent proceeding superseding the former one. I would not have addressed such an interjection to the honorable and learned senator had I known he was qualifying his remarks with regard to the force of the first proceeding taken. We have heard from the other side that the Western Australian procedure applied because the petitioner had adopted it, and it was a matter of mere generosity on the part of the committee to concede this to the petitioner. </para>

If the tribunal is one of such a character that it is not bound by any particular procedure at all, but can concede as an act of grace to any party that comes before it the right to follow his own procedure, surety they could have agreed to a laxity sufficient to enable them to overcome a little technical difficulty of the kind which has arisen. </para>

                        <para>- That is an elastic provision in this Western, Australian statute which a court, bound by the strictest rules of law, following the provisions of the statute, would be bound to act upon. I contend that if that applied to a court which is most strictly bound to confine its jurisdiction within the four corners of the statute, it applies with greater force to a tribunal which can take upon itself the right of conceding an act of grace to a party who comes before it in the way it is said this tribunal has done with regard to this petition. </para>

                        <para>- I submit that, holding that the Western Australian law applies in its utmost strictness, it may still be contended that the petitioner in this case has substantially complied with all the requirements of that law and its procedure, to enable his petition to come up for determination upon its merits. That is as far as the report of the committee has gone. He has lodged his Â£50 deposit. He forwarded his petition within the 40 clays. It was in the hands of the Clerk of this Chamber, and, though I do not consider it necessary, in his hands it is also in the hands of the clerk of the court. It has not gone from this Chamber to any outside tribunal at all. It is practically here, and any senator might have moved that the petition be referred to the court. Any senator might have got up and moved that this petition be referred to ourselves, but . I contend that even that was not necessary, because here we have absolutely a new court, the like of which did not exist, and was not contemplated by that statute. Here we have circumstances -the creation of a new Parliament, and a Parliament which had not laid down its procedure in regard to these matters - which were never contemplated by the framers of that Act. I say we can only apply the provisions of the statute so far as they are applicable to the existence of such a court as this in the circumstances by which it is surrounded at this present year of our history. On the other hand it has been stated by honorable senators opposite that this Western Australian law does not apply, and again when we really come to consider this matter on its merits - and I hope that every honorable senator applies his mind to the consideration of this question with a desire to do substantial justice between these parties- I cannot for the life of me understand why, when it is stated that the Western Australian law does not apply we should acquiesce in and adopt a report of this character - </para>

                        <para>- I am not applying this as a general rule, and I hope that no such circumstances will ever occur again as will necessitate another discussion of this character in this Chamber. I hope we shall never again have submitted to this Chamber a report of this character. I think the report, considering the whole of the circumstances, may not only be characterized as unprecedented, but as something of which we maj* hope we will never have another illustration in the future. It has been pointed out on the other side, with a great deal of force, that to allow this Chamber to review a decision that may be arrived at, either on a question of law or a question of fact, in connexion with a petition, would be a very great evil, inasmuch as it might give rise to partisan decisions, but will it not appear to the minds of honorable senators who use that argument that if the evil of partisan decisions by the whole Chamber is something we should carefully shun, we should equally carefully shun it with regard to the particular tribunal that is charged with reporting on this matter? Would it not be possible that even a partisan decision might be arrived at in a committee of this kind ? </para>

                    <para>- I should like to draw attention to the fact that some words that were uttered during the discussion in committee on this Bill, in regard to the employment of lascar seamen, were prophetic, inasmuch as what was foreshadowed is being carried into effect. It was said that the Orient Company would soon follow the example of the Peninsular and Oriental Company in respect of the employment of lascars. It was denied by some speakers that lascars are employed by the Peninsular and Oriental Company because their labour is cheaper than that of white men. I wish to draw attention to the fact that Iascar seamen are about to be employed by the Orient Company, because I believe the Senate will have another opportunity, at the instigation of the Government, of reconsidering its decision upon this question. I trust that when we have an opportunity of dealing with it we shall not forget that we are now face to face with the fact that the two largest steam-ship companies trading between Australia and the United Kingdom are now employing Iascar' crews. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that this is the proper stage for a discussion on this question. The motion is that the Bill be read a third time. The honorable senator is alluding to matters which are not in the Bill. The general policy of the Government in reference to Iascar seamen is not embodied in this Bill, and therefore this is not the light time to discuss that policy </para>

                    <para>- I am not altogether in accord with the motion before the Senate. We have been going through this Bill now for some weeks. We have considered it on the second reading, and we .have gone through it very carefully in many instances, and at other times less carefully, in committee. There are several clauses in the Bill against which I must register my protest ; but as honorable senators know the grounds of my opposition, I do not intend to enter upon them now. This is the first piece of legislation of a practical character that we have had before the Senate, and, as the marginal notes show, it has been framed by reference to similar statutes passed in other States. I hope this will be the last attempt on the part of the Government to utilize a purely machinery Bill for the purpose of legislating by implication on matters of a social kind, in connexion with which the States have still undoubtedly the exclusive right to legislate for themselves. I did hope that the Postmaster-General and other honorable senators would have seen their way to have guaranteed the preservation of State rights, and the rights of municipal authorities, to a greater extent than they have guaranteed them in some of the clauses in this Bil], which relate to matters in which there might be a difference of opinion, as to the telegraph wires of the departments and wires erected by any local authority in order to conduct light or power. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that the. Postmaster-General's remarks will prove correct. I think that a little more consideration might have been given to the matter, and more attention paid to those communities which had erected works of the character to which I have referred, with due attention to the statutory obligations imposed upon them by their particular States. Under all the circumstances I cannot .say that I find myself in accord with the motion before the Chair. </para>
