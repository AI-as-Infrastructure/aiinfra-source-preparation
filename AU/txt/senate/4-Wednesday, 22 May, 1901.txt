              <para>- I know there are differences of opinion on that point ; but however that may be, we know what the Constitution is now, and we know that it has been recognised in the Constitution even as amended that as a general rule, in all cases where questions arise involving the interpretation of the Constitution, it shall be interpreted by Australian courts and by Australian judges. There are exceptions which are known, but the Senate may be well assured that nothing will be done by this Government to whittle away in any degree the preeminence in regard to the decision on matters of Australian concern in the interpretation of the Constitution which has been given, to us by the Constitution itself. There is. another matter of machinery which is really necessary also to carry out the principles of the Constitution, .and that is the Inter-State Commission. Honorable members will recognise that it will be of very little value to the trading community of Australia to prevent interference with trade by the Customs house, if you allow interference with trade by rival railway systems to continue. Therefore, following the example of America and all other railway systems passing from one State to another, the Constitution has provided that there shall be a means by which there shall be fair dealing, and nothing more is asked, in all Inter-State traffic. It is our intention at the earliest possible moment to introduce a, measure which is now ready for the purpose of appointing an Inter-State Commission, and for the-purpose also of laying down the principles which will guide that commission in its decisions, find determining the tenure of office of the commissioners. </para>

              <para>- I would, but I am afraid he has got into very bad habits in New South Wales, and I do not know what a certain daily paper would say if the honorable member followed me. Now, there is another principle and a main principle underlying the union, and that is this : It has become the -fixed opinion of Australia from end to end that this continent shall be kept for all time for the white races. That is a principle winch has been forced upon the people for social reasons - reasons so sound, to my way of thinking, that I have no hesitation in saying that whatever happened to the sugar industry, or to any other industry, I think that the social objections to the growing up in our midst of a race inferior to ourselves impossible to admit into our political system is fraught with so many dangers, and full of such possibilities of degradation to white people, that I should prefer to see that industry brought to an end rather than that the principle should ever be embodied in our Constitution of allowing the admixture of black with the white races of Australia. But, having Stated that principle, I say that in carrying it out we are brought face to face with another principle which underlies the -whole of this union, and it is this : Whether it is stated by the Constitution or not, we must remember that this is not only a Constitution embodying the machinery of the Government, but it is also a union of States ; it is not only a union of States, but is a union of the people of the States, and it .is, and must "be, 'an underlying principle of that "union that this Commonwealth -Parliament shall do nothing which should unnecessarily disturb or prejudice :any -existing interests throughout 'any portion of Australia. </para>

              <para>- I will explain to the honorable member in .a moment what I mean, and he will see that it is in the meaning put in -actual fact upon the word, that the whole question of -how this black labour is to be dealt with hinges. I say that, first of all, it,must be admitted that that is one of the principles underlying all this union, and I apply it not only ito '.the question of sugar growing, or of black labour - I -apply it to fill the .industrial conditions of Australia ; I apply it to 'the industries which have grown up in "Victoria and other parts of Australia : I apply it to the interests which, my friends Senators Gould and Millen have so much at heart - the interests of -the .'free port of Sydney; I apply it to every .interest in every portion of Australia, and for -this rea- son. As I have said, it is not only a union of States, it is a: union of peoples ; and you cannot interfere to any serious -extent with any one industry which 'employs and .gives wages to men and women in this Commonwealth ; yOU cannot disturb or interfere with it without interfering with the comfort and convenience, the happiness and prosperity,. of certain individuals. I say you have no right to unnecessarily 'take away a man's living, or to interfere with the comfort and happiness of his wife and -children unless you can show some reason for the interference. It is an underlying principle of "this union that a compromise must take place in regard to a great deal of our legislation, and that no unnecessary wrong or .injury shall be inflicted upon any individual. Now, I make that broad statement for the reason that we are dealing with this question of black labour - not in :a debating society ; not in a place in -which we 'frame propositions in the abstract, good or bad ; but in a place where we are dealing -with flesh and blood, and where every piece of legislation will affect directly the individual people of the Commonwealth. Therefore, I say, in dealing with-the application of the principle of the abolition of kanaka labour, which, as I have said already, I take to be clearly and definitely agreed upon throughout all Australia, we must remember that, while it should be abolished with all possible speed, it should be abolished in such a way as to not unnecessarily and harshly disturb the interests of any individuals in that part of Australia which is particularly interested. Of course, the extent and time of interference and its method' are matters which will be involved in the legislation which will be brought before you, and the details will be found such as to meet all requirements of the case. In the first place, let me tell something to the Senate of what the interests are that are involved. Much of what I am about to say may probably be an old story to honorable members who come from Queensland. I regret extremely that my honorable colleague, the Postmaster-General, who has an acquaintance much more intimate than I can possibly have with the whole of this controversy, is not here. Unfortunately he is away in the discharge of Ministerial duty with His Excellency, and I am afraid will not return until after this debate closes. Tn the meantime, it is necessary for me to tell what the interests are that are involved, and I think a great deal of what I have to say will be new to honorable members who have not had details put before them on former occasions. Now, in order to ascertain what we are really dealing with in carrying out this principle of the abolition of Kanaka labour, we must remember that it is a question which affects not only the large sugar works, the corporation, the syndicate, or the company, but which affects to a very large extent many men of small means and small holdings, who, under the system of central mills in Queensland, have been able to grow sugar at a profit. </para>

            <para>Particularly in the case of the owners that are furnishing cane for the Government central mills, the growing is done by farmers who have taken np and own or occupy those lands. These facts place before us a situation that is almost unique and peculiar to Queensland. In other cane sugar-growing countries the estates are in the hands of extensive owners or controlled by large corporations, which state carries with it the consequence that a minimum number of white men are located on the land. In this colony the ownership or occupancy embraces a vast number of strong, representative, and progressive white men, who are planted over all the sugar-growing area. These men furnish the material which puts the mills into operation, and as the mills depend wholly upon the field, it appears that the future of the sugar industry of the colony is very much in the hands of those numerous and small cane-growers. </para>

I think it is possible to get at something like the number of persons involved in the industries we have to deal with under the question of the abolition of black labour, even by perhaps nothing more than a rough estimate. Apart altogether from the men actually employed, there is something like ?5,000,000 of capital invested . in the industry. </para>

I do not care how many white men the employment of black men tends to give wages to. The principle that we are determined to -carry out stands above all such considerations, and therefore we are not concerned with the extent to which white men may be found employment by the use of black labour. I merely state the position in order to show how -many white men are involved in the labour and operations of these plantations. </para>

              <para>- I have not. But take another aspect of the matter. I have some particulars here of the number of men employed at the Millaquin and Yengarie Sugar Company's Works. The employment is divided between the slack season and the next juicy season, which I assume means the next busy period. The company has a mill and four plantations, and employs 173 kanakas at wages aggregating .?3,456, in addition to 330 white men, whose wages and salaries amount to ?17,402, that is in the slack season. In the busy season, according -to this estimate, there are 197 kanakas employed, and receiving wages amounting to ,?2,02S ; while 620 whites are engaged, whose wages. aggregate ?19,502. </para>

We all know that honorable members sometimes like to rush into the fray to identify themselves with a particular form of a popular question. I do not impute any motives to the honorable member, but it is a most unfortunate thing for him that his leader, who would make a proposition of this sort with some responsibility, because he would be bound to carry it out if. he came into power- </para>

I do -not blame the honorable member a bit from the party point of. view. He thinks, that, perhaps, he may give the Government an uncomfortable quarter of an hour. If. it pleases bini to . think that he has done that, I am- perfectly satisfied. The Government have no. apprehension: whatever upon the result of this amendment. I treat it, and, the Government treat it, as a censure upon them, and they must so treat it. The Government have given every guarantee possible, that they are staunchly and straight out in, favour, of the abolition of kanaka labour ; . but, at- the same time, they feel themselves under an obligation to those interested in this industry in Queensland not to allow the carrying out of that principle to be effected in an unnecessary harsh manner or in an unfair manner. I think this House will rather trust the Government, under the policy as stated by them in this speech, to do justice to every one than affirm the principle enunciated by the honorable member, which involves on the face of it the grossest want of uniformity and the grossest injustice in dealing with the individuals whose interests are involved. </para>

All the Government are concerned with now, and all they are bound to do now, is to state their general policy to the House, and just as it would be a wrong tiling for the Government to take action in this matter without full inquiry, so it would be a wrong thing for them to bind themselves to any details which might operate unjustly when inquiries can be made. Do not let me be misunderstood on this question. I do not mean to say for one moment that it is the intention to hang this thing up by appointing a commission. I do not mean to say that it is the intention of the Government to make any delay by pretending to inquire into tilings which are obvious and patent no*, but it is their intention to make all the inquiries necessary in order to do justice. </para>

              <para>- Let me put another very strong reason why it appears to me that this House should not adopt the amendment. This question of the dealing with the kanaka labour and the interests of the persons who are employed, and who have capital invested, in the sugar industry cannot be fairly considered apart from the fiscal issue. If you put no duty on sugar, and, therefore, make very much worse the condition of the planter and those whom he employs than it is at present) it may be that, it would be grossly unfair to put upon him the hardship of a rapid diminution of coloured labour. On the other hand, if you give him by a reasonable duty what is a compensation to him - if you give him that which increases the price of sugar to him - then you may all the more quickly put him in a position to get rid of his kanaka labour. I think I have only to state a few figures in order to show honorable members how directly this question of the imposition of a duty upon sugar will affect the sugar grower. Honorable members will find that the consumption of sugar in Australia at the present time is 170,000 tons. Of that quantity Queensland supplies 130,000 tons, New South Wales supplies about 25,000 tons, and the balance comes from other places. So that the supply in Australia itself is about 15,000 tons short of the demand. The inference from that is obvious - that where the supply is less than the demand and a duty is imposed the producer gets the benefit of practically the whole of the duty. If any duty is put upon the production of sugar, and any duty is put upon the importation of sugar, the benefit of it is directly felt by the sugar producers throughout Queensland and other parts of Australia. Therefore, I contend that when you are dealing with the question of how you are to bring about fairly and reasonably the abolition of the introduction of kanaka labour, you cannot do it without knowing to what extent you are going to help the sugar-grower by the imposition of duty. </para>

              <para>- I do not agree with the honorable member at all. It seems to me that that is a different question altogether. What we say is that this question must be considered as a whole. We must find out in the first place how we can help you with our Tariff. If we can help you much, then this kanaka labour must be brought to an end very speedily. If we can help you less, it may be that we may have to give you a little more time; but, whatever it is, we must consider both together, and we shall then arrive at a resonable and fair conclusion. The honorable member would abolish the duty altogether. He would say - "Let us have free-trade ; let us take away the protection which the sugar-grower gets now," and on that side lie would attack him. He would also put an immediate stop to the importation of the kanaka, and would stab the sugar-grower on that side too. </para>

              <para>- I beg the honorable member's pardon. I did him an injustice in saying that. What I ought to have said was that his amendment would prevent the grower from getting one of the benefits of federation, while, on the other hand, it would enforce in the mast reckless possible way against him the carrying out of one of the principles of federation. Perhaps that is a more correct way of putting it. I have taken up some time on this question, because it appeared to me that it was a matter on which the Senate requires the fullest information. It became my duty at once, directly the position of the Government was challenged, to state plainly the principles upon which they intend to act, and the reasons why the House should trust the statement of principle in this speech rather than rush into an affirmation of this abstract proposition, which could have no effect whatever but to temporarily embarrass the Government, and to bring about an injustice if any one had the hardihood to carry it out. </para>

If the honorable member is willing that duties shall'beimposed'for the purpose of collecting, revenue, how can he make a selection of articles without giving some of them protection ? But the honorable member's principle is this - he says : "I will impose duties, but I will take care that I treat all products and industries alike." Does that mean- that he would, tax every product, or that he would adjust his- Tariff in such away as to give- no possible benefit to anybody? </para>

              <para>- There are unemployed here and in England, and I can indicate how prosperity in time may result in a number of persons being out of work. I want first to prove, however-, that Germany under her policy has for the last 25 years gone faster than Great Britain under her policy. That is what we want to arrive at. It is not a question of whether she has overtaken her or- whether she has not ; the point is which country is making the greater progress. </para>

              <para>- Yes, necessarily. I remember that in 1884 there was great depression not only in South Australia, New South Wales, and Tasmania., but in New Zealand, now one of the most prosperous places in the world. What was the condition of Melbourne at that time? </para>

              <para>- How many thousands have left Great Britain and come to this country to save themselves ? What I do object to is the attempt to attribute effects to causes that have nothing to do with them. We are told to look at the progress of New South Wales. She has gone ahead of "Victoria within the last ten years. The first portion of the last ten years was the very time that the terrible collapse was brought about by this undue prosperity. What has occurred in New South Wales during that time? Was it free-trade that brought about prosperity there? Was it not the immense amount of money which they borrowed and had to expend within the last ten years in excess of what was borrowed by Victoria ? Was it not the amount of money that came into the coffers ' of the Treasurer of New South Wales through the sale of Crown lands ? They were living on their fab, and were bound to suffer ultimately. Then you talk about an increase of population. Did not 15,000,000 acres of fairly good agricultural land fall in, and was not a good deal of it apportioned to agriculturists ? </para>

              <para>- The land tax in New South Wales is a beautiful land tax. In a country with an area of 340,000 square miles, the land tax does not return ?300,000. What is the use of putting a ridiculous proposition like that before anybody ? </para>

              <para>- Talk about over-population. There is room here for millions yet. Any comparison between Victoria and New South Wales must be a long' way in favour of Victoria. You might as well compare a farmer with 10,000 acres of good land to a farmer with only 1,000 acres of land of the same character. Look at the immense coal industry that New South Wales has had the advantage of. See what that has done for her. See what an immense amount of wool she has got off that large area, and the wealth it has brought into New South Wales. If New South Wales had been well governed, industries might have been established. When I asked those who were praising the position of New South Wales to name her industries they did not do so ; they did not give me an opportunity of showing them how those industries were fostered. Everything that is in' New South Wales has been provided for the people by Providence, and they have scarcely done anything for themselves. They have not straightened their streets yet. </para>

              <para>- They do, but unfortunately should gold-fields break out or any other inducement be offered, white men frequently do not care two straws for their agreements. After all, a number of the kanakas who are imported into Queensland come from the New Hebrides, which are under joint British and French control, and it seems to me that there is a great deal to be said in favour of a very careful and gradual reduction. It is all very well for us in this cold climate to speak about Northern Queensland, and to say that the white man can work as effectively there as the black man. But I heard only the other day from a gentleman who has made a close investigation into this subject that on one plantation where they have 70 white men employed all the year round, the sugar planter told him that he had had 420 going through the mill in a year ; that is, they only remained an average of two months at a time. </para>

              <para>- I fail to see the logic of the honorable senator's interjection. I want to make it perfectly clear to the Senate that if fin injustice is going to be done to one, it is going to be done, sooner or later, to all of them ; but, if ground can be put under cultivation for sugar at the present moment without kanakas - because that is the only conclusion we can draw from statements before the Senate - it is perfectly clear that no greater hardship will be done to one planter to-day than will be done to the whole of them in the course of the next few years. I like to look logically into what I do. The Government desire to procrastinate. They never want to say anything definite. They deal with nothing but generalities. They do not give you a single concrete fact to go on. Take the Governor-General's speech. It is simply a vague statement of a policy to be spread over several years. Who ever heard of a speech from the Throne dealing with a policy intended to cover several years'? The Government do not give us the least indication of what Bills are to be dealt with during the present session. They are simply generalizing ; simply waiting to see how much they can dare to keep back. I was going to say it is all humbug, but I am afraid it would be out of order to use such a word. </para>

              <para>- There is' one point in the Governor-General's speech which affects members for Western Australia most materially, that is the question of the Inter-State line necessary to connect the railway system of Western Australia with that of the eastern States. I was surprised to hear the representative of the Government in this Senate say in a loud tone last evening that no pledge whatever had been made that this railway would be constructed. It is true that no pledge exists in writing. No document has been given, signed and sealed with the seal of the Commonwealth or bearing the signatures of the Federal Ministers. Senators, however, must have a very short memory if they forget that to all intents and purposes this railway forms portion of the defence scheme which was the original basis of the federation of Australia. I do not think any senator is prepared to challenge me in that statement. In case he should be, however, I have brought into the Senate a report made by Major-General Edwards in 1889 on the military forces and defences of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>-Not quite a trap, but a trap in the parliamentary sense. I unfortunately did not weigh my words quite so carefully as I should have clone. When the honorable and learned member asked me if I based my statement that there was a contract with the Government on Major General Edwards' report, and treated the Government as a representative of the whole of the Commonwealth, I certainly said - "Yes." What I should have said was that there was an implied contract with the whole Commonwealth that this railway should be built, just as much as there was an understanding that the forts necessary for the defence of Australia should be taken over by the Commonwealth. When I said yes to his question I was simply alluding to the Government in the large sense in which it should be taken to represent the whole Commonwealth of Australia. I absolutely fail to see how any gentleman who advocated the federation of these States, on the basis that for the defence of the whole Commonwealth it was necessary that federation should be accomplished - and I think there is hardly a member in the Chamber who has not advocated federation on those grounds - can afford to ignore the particular paragraph to which I called attention in Major-General Edwards' report. The language is absolutely conclusive. He deals with all the other branches of defence, which were necessary, and in no one of the paragraphs dealing with those branches does he speak with any tiling like the emphasis that he uses when dealing with this question of the line to "Western Australia. Still, so that honorable members may have it sufficiently in their minds, I shall repeat exactly what he said. He said this : - </para>

              <para>- The honorable gentleman said that to me privately yesterday, and he seemed to think that that settled the question. He fails to recognise that we have taken this country from the blacks, and made it a white man's country, and intend to keep it a white man's country, so that there is no earthly use in the honorable gentleman saying that 100 years ago this was a black man's country. </para>

              <para>- We are aware of that fact, and it is very regrettable, and the only consolation we have is that they are gradually dying out. If the honorable gentleman had had any knowledge of Western Australia he would have known that very large portions of the very best pastoral country in that State are almost barred from pastoral occupation on account of the savageness of the blacks. I am not a person who advocates the attitude that persons in the West are taking up towards the blacks. I consider that it is an extremely reprehensible one. At the same time, I will say that the result of enforcing law and order there has been that large portions of the very best pastoral country cannot be taken up for pastoral purposes, simply because they are inhabited by extremely savage blacks. </para>

              <para>-There the honorable gentleman is mistaken. In the Southern parts of America the experience is that they intermarry to a very large extent, and the result is a race of people who are very often of extreme beauty. There is no possible means of ascertaining .that, they have been tarnished by a black strain, and the result is that they intermarry with families who would infinitely prefer to keep themselves pure in blood without any suspicion being entertained at the time that such an inter-marriage of races is going on. </para>

              <para>- That is a very difficult argument to answer. But I would ask what the honorable gentleman thinks the will of the people is worth on the question of the right of appeal to the Privy Council. Not one man in a thousand knows anything about it. Although the honorable gentleman has given me theoretically a strong argument, I do not think it is practically any argument at all. My point is that the House of Commons were so generous in dealing with this Bill, and in giving up their own convictions and Imperial principles, that I should like to have seen some sentences in the speech thanking them. I think honorable members will be very much surprised at the precedent I am able to give them for the speech delivered by the Governor-General. There are sixteen or seventeen different subjects alluded to or promised, and when the last speaker was talking about seven years' work I counted the number of measures mentioned in the Canadian speech, which was exactly the same. A most extraordinary coincidence is that the last measure alluded to is "a measure defining the privileges of Parliament and for the establishing of uniform laws relating to elections and the trial of controverted elections." I do not suppose many honorable gentlemen have read the book from which I have quoted, and I will point out that the very criticisms which have been hurled against this speech are really meaningless if this is any precedent whatever.' </para>

              <para>- Hear, hear. And I put Australia before party government. In reference to this great issue then I take it that no effective criticism can be indulged in by any one till the Tariff has been laid on the table. Let us look at one or two sentences on both sides. The Prime Minister has promised that he will frame an Australian Tariff for an Australian people. That is a very nice sentence, but what is its meaning? The only interpretation of a sentence like that will be seen when the duties are placed on the table. The Prime Minister said, also, that he would have a revenue Tariff which would not be destructive of industries. That, also, is a magnificent phrase, which, no doubt, gained many votes. But what does it mean ? We shall have to wait till we see the duties on the table. What do our friends of the Opposition say? They talk about- "a system of commerce," "an ocean of human freedom," "channels of human industry," and a lot of stock phrases of that sort. What do they mean? Probably, what they meant iri New South Wales, namely, that you would have a freetrade policy with a "but" in it. The moment an industry begins to cry out ; the moment it calls out - " If you do not mingle a little of the waters of protection with this ocean of freedom, you will not remain in it much longer," the free-trade leader responds to it. He deliberately gives these sugar planters a measure of protection. </para>

Rome was not built in a day, and you will not construct the foundations of this edifice at the rate at which some of us want to go. In the work before us, as set out in the Governor-General's's speech - the work we have to do in creating the machinery of the Constitution, and setting it going - there are three or four months of solid hard labour, and I do not think it possible for Ministers to find time to do justice to the framing of a Federal Tariff this session. I am aware the commercial trader tells us we are dislocating his business by delaying this question. But he is uttering sentences which, while they have a scintilla of truth in them, are a gross exaggeration. He is suffering inconveniences which he knew he must incur when he voted " yes " at the referendum. </para>

              <para>- The Convention met in this magnificent building in January, February, and March to give the final touches to the Federal Constitution, and we were very comfortable. I do not think the hot weather interfered with the work of the Convention. I do not want to delay the work. I believe Tasmania is going to benefit more by free-trade than any of the other States. Almost the whole of her industries are natural. Her fruit, her pulp, her minerals, her wool - we have hardly a single industry which is to gain by protection. All our industries in Tasmania are natural, and I yield to no one in my desire to have free-trade as soon as possible. Is that any reason, however, why I should desire to face the work when it is likely to be ill and slovenly done, and when I know that neither the experts engaged in framing the Tariff, nor the Ministers employed in settling it, have had time to give to the proposals? </para>

              <para>- This opens up a very wide question indeed, and it is a question which I know Canada is thinking about for herself. Is it worth while to give something for nothing ? It has been pointed out that owing to Canada having given this preference to the mother country she has disentitled herself at the hands of Germany to the most favoured nation clause. Because she allows the goods of Great Britain to go in at a cheaper rate than she allows German imports to go in, Germany therefore has a right to cut her out of this treatment which she is bound to give to England and her colonies. Germany now contends that Canada has drifted from that treaty, and that she can impose on German goods any duty which she pleases. It becomes an important question for Ministers to consider whether, if they propose a preference, as I hope they will, for the goods of old England, they will be in the same position as Canada occupies, and whether we shall at the hands of our German cousins be liable to have our goods taxed at a greater rate than the goods of Great Britain are taxed at. This brings us face to face with the much bigger question, and to my mind the greatest question, which is now before the empire of Greater Britain, and that is whether we are, or are not, to have an Imperial Zollverein ; whether we are, or are not, to have an Imperial -trade preference. If it is a good thing to have a trade preference between one State and the mother country - Canada says that it is, and if I remember aright, a majority of the candidates in their election speeches said it would be - it is the thin edge of the wedge, and we are face to face at once with the question whether the right thing to do by the mother land, and to develop the great empire to which we belong, is not to have an Imperial preference whereby the goods of the different States shall go into the mother country free, whereas some small duty, small as you please, which will bring in an enormous amount of revenue, shall be levied on the goods of other nations. This, I suppose, will make our free-trade friends hold up their hands in horror. It might to an infinitesimal extent increase the price of bread. It might to some extent increase the price of the raw material with which some of the great industries of Great Britain are carried on, and no one, I hope, would do anything to seriously injure the trade of the British manufacturers, unless there was some very great .advantage on the other side. </para>

              <para>- I have just said that it would be taxing the food of the people in an infinitesimal way ; but you quite forget that it opens up the question of the defence of the Empire, and the defence of this trade and commerce, without which there can be no empire. If you can -protect to some slight extent the trade of the empire and the States, it would bring in an enormous revenue and help the mother country to increase her position, and enable us to defend that very commerce which is really the backbone of our power. </para>

It seems to me that an amendment having been moved, it is competent to discuss the whole question on the amendment. I do not see how members can discuss the amendment without discussing the main question. Of course, it does not follow that if the amendment is negatived the Address is passed. The question will be put that the words proposed to be added be added. If they are added, I will put the question as amended. If they are not added, I will put the question as not amended. </para>

              <para>- No doubt the senators on that side of the House view such a possibility with fear. If such an event should take place, are we to go back and have an election on the same unequal franchise in the various States; to have an election under the same extraordinary laws that we had last? There is another matter of great national importance, the principle of old-age pensions. This important question has been quietly shelved by the Government. I think there is no higher indication of the degree of civilization to which a nation has attained than is shown by the attention paid to those who through old age or sickness are prevented from providing themselves with the necessities of life. I hope it will never in future be said of Australians that those who have built up this grand young nation, who have borne the heat and burden of the day, and whose distress demands our sympathy, have been neglected in their old age. I admit that an Old-age Pensions Bill cannot be introduced until the taxation proposals have been fixed. Such a proposal would probably7 cost ?1,000,000 per annum. It must be borne in mind that in Victoria and New South Wales, whose populations comprise three-fourths of the population of Australia, they have already got their schemes in operation. The extra cost to the community is about ?250,000 ; and I think it is very much better to spend the money in this way than to expend it on fantastical military training, navies, and things of that description. If we have in Australia a proper volunteer service and an adequate coastal defence, that is all we require. </para>

              <para>- Then they propose to gradually diminish the introduction of labour from the South Sea Islands. In Victoria, some years ago, they spoke of a protective tariff of 10 or 15 per cent, being put on and gradually abolished ; possibly the Government are going to abolish Kanaka labour in the same way at some future date. I should like to see a comprehensive Bill for the absolute prohibition of the immigration, not only of Asiatics, but of all alien labour, whether British subjects or not. It is a question of our nationality, and all other considerations must be set aside. " </para>

              <para>- I don't say that, but we should see that our race is not contaminated by the incursions of aliens. If we consider for a moment we shall see that Australia is a continent nearly as large as the whole of Europe. It is populated by a little garrison of white people numbering about four millions, and it is surrounded by alien races, some of whom are numbered by hundreds of millions, who are casting hungry eyes on this land. If we allow a stream of aliens to come in, that stream will grow until we will be unable to stop it, and in a short space of time we will be fighting not for sentiment but for very existence. If we turn to history, we will find that the cotton planter in the sub-tropical portions of the United States said they required black labour in order to work their plantations. The result is that there are two races growing up there - a black and a white - each hostile to the other, with strong racial feuds, and we hear from time to time of lynching, murders, and other atrocities. This is a matter that has exercised the minds of ' patriotic sons of the United States. It has exercised the thoughts of her greatest men, and is a problem that can never be solved. I think we should take a lesson from the pages of history. The Northern Territory is swarming with Chinese and Japanese. I understand they are nearly the sole inhabitants, and they could take possession of the whole of the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps so ; but they would be able to form a base there, from which Japan could send supplies to assist them. If we absolutely exclude these aliens we can keep a white Australia, and hand down this great inheritance given us with added lustre to those who follow. In the Governor-General's speech the Government have touched on nearly every one of the 39 articles in some form or other. Some they have merely patted on the back, such as old age pensions, which they are going to relegate to the distant future. Perhaps the only thing they have not mentioned in the speech is the subject of astronomy. </para>

              <para>- I can assure the representative of the Government that it is not going to happen so far as I am concerned. I am going to debate the fiscal proposals clause by clause. I believe that other honorable gentlemen are going to do the same, and we are not going to allow the prestige of the Senate, or our rights in the great matter of the Tariff" to be subservient to the whim of the Government as to when they should introduce such an important measure as the Tariff Bill. </para>

            <para>- That I do not know. I believe that a large number of honorable members desire to speak. If we met at half past ten o'clock, and sat on until four, or even half-past that hour, it would give us six hours ; but if we meet at half-past two o'clock and go on until a similar hour, it will not give us very much more time. </para>

            <para>- This is another evidence of that independence which gives nobody else a chance. I also have very important engagements that will occupy me all the morning. If any suggestion of this kind had been made two days ago, I am sure it would have been earnestly considered by a good many of the representatives of other States. I come from another State, and I have as much desire to get away to-morrow afternoon as anybody has. But then when we get no intimation of what is going to be proposed, and people do everything on their own without consulting anybody else, they cannot expect to be supported. </para>
