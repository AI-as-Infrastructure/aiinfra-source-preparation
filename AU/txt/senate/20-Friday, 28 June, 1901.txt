                        <para>- The land should be assessed by a commissioner. If such a motion were passed by the Senate, those people who have been conjuring up ideas of an enormous accession of wealth upon the selection of their land for the federal capital would be shown that they will have their property taken over merely at its ordinary value. I feel very confident that when that is done, instead of wishing us to accept their land, they will ask us to depart out of their coasts and go somewhere else for our federal capital site. Instead of being bothered by these leagues, who wish us to " buy them out, we shall be let alone. I hope that we shall be able to fix the capital site away from all towns if possible, on an area comprising, very much more than 100 square miles,, and whose present population is as small as possible, so that the expense of resumption will not be a burden on the Commonwealth. The commissioner finds that under the Constitution he cannot pick out any site within 100 miles of Sydney, but he gets over that difficulty by a very specious argument. Of course we know that the Commonwealth Constitution Act is an Imperial Act, and we are bound by Imperial rules and procedure in regard to it. The 100- mile limit, therefore, would be decided by Imperial rules. The commissioner has disregarded this. I venture to think that New South. Wales has been the dominant idea in his mind throughout, and lie has taken the New South Wales law that the distance shall be measured .according to the nearest road, and not in a direct line, as provided in the English rules. He has thus been able to come within the line which lias been thrown round Sydney, and to select one or two towns within the 100-mile limit. I think when we see - as honorable senators must see - that the- commissioner has failed- entirety to grasp the exigencies of the case, that he lias gone on the wrong assumption in selecting these towns, and that' he has made egregious mistakes, we shall agree that the- best thing we can- do is- to quietly drop his report in the- waste-paper basket, and, having had selected a; dozen sites by men of experience go round and inspect them ourselves. There is no doubt that the questions of choosing the federal site, and the area of it, are the most important subjects that will engage the attention of this first Parliament of the Commonwealth. The capital will last for all time. It will be the one monumental work that will be done by this Parliament. For- the next 1,000 years we shall be- credited with sagacity if we-choose a good site, or want of-' grasp of the- necessities of the case if we pick one that is not subsequently found to be suitable. The first assumption upon which we should go is that the site should not be a town. If we pick a site where there is a large and flourishing town, as in- the cases of Orange and Queanbeyan, the expense of buying out the property owners would be so enormous that millions of pounds would have to be expended in actual dead-work before we could start building the capital. I presume that we should have to buy out the owners and cart away the whole existing town as rubbish. The commissioner appointed by the New South Wales Government points out that some- sites would cost over a million sterling for the land alone. That calculation is based on the supposition that we should have to pay an increased value- for the land. I can assure the people of New South Wales who are so desirous that the capital should be instituted as soon as possible, that if we are to expend such enormous sums the time that must elapse before the capital is built must be very much extended, on account of the outlay that will attach to the- buying out of these towns. The area, as I have said in my motion, should be at least 33 miles square. If we have- an area of 10 miles square, directly we decide upon the site of the federal capital there will be a perfect eruption of land-grabbers, syndicates, and speculators, who will rush over to buy up land all round with the idea of forming suburbs for the people to dwell in. The consequence will be that the people of the capital, instead of living within federal territory, will reside in suburbs belonging to private people, and the immense revenue the Commonwealth should receive as ground landlord will go into the pockets of these speculators. It is impossible to say what the actual size of the federal capital will be. All depends upon the position, the qualities of the soil, the commercial prospects, and other considerations of that kind. If we assume that it is to be a capital like Washington, that has practically no trade, no commerce, and no industries, we may assume that, like Washington, it will attain to a size of about a quarter of a million of inhabitants. But there is absolutely no reason why the capital should not be a great commercial, centre like Chicago. Chicago, being in a position where there are great facilities for trade, has in a comparatively few years attained a population of over a million inhabitants. There are none of us here who will say that in Australia in time to come there will not be inland towns having at least a million inhabitants. There is no reason why our capital should not before many years have passed attain even to the magnitude of a city like Chicago. If that is to be the case, obviously 1,000 square miles would be altogether inadequate. I sincerely hope we shall not take less than an area of 4,000 or 5,000 square miles in a part of the country where the land is not very valuable, but it is well that there should be an expression of opinion from the Senate that the area should at least be not less than 1,000 square miles. When we set down the lines upon which land is to be taken for the capital, and state what is to be the minimum area, we should also set down what is to be the mode on which we are to acquire it. Instead of picking 10 miles square including a place like Bombala it is to be hoped that we shall leave out all towns of that character, and go into a district where we can obtain a site upon a high table land, not top distant from a port, with good climatic conditions, with no large towns in the immediate vicinity to take away trade, with satisfactory pastoral and. agricultural land, ample timber resources, and a sufficient water supply. If we decide to proceed on those lines we shall recognise the futility of a report like that prepared in New South Wales, which maps out an area of ten miles square, including important towns which it will take £1,000,000 to buy out. Then to cap all I have said, the New South </para>

                <para>The question of offering a much larger area to the Commonwealth than 100 square miles may be expected to turn upon the mutual benefit or loss that such a transaction might be expected to entail. . . .

                        <para>- Whether those who are clamouring are a very small proportion or not, they evidently influenced some of -the -last elections, and the "proportion -seems to be growing. There is this difficulty in connexion with perpetual leases, that, although you. give the owner the right of transfer in certain cases, such transfer is always subject to the. approval of the Government of the .day, .and the delay and trouble .thus occasioned is so great that the .people are now clamouring -for the fee-simple. </para>

I do not think that the passing of this resolution would achieve any useful purpose. I agree with the mover of the motion, that if a larger area than is provided for in the Constitution Act is attainable, Ave should by all means secure it ; but do not let us tie the hands of the Government. and our own hands, by passing a resolution which involves an undesirable and useless expenditure of public money, and which, to some extent I am afraid, would simply commit all parties to the attainment of the unattainable. </para>

                    <para>. - I hope the Senate will not assent to this motion. The Government oppose it for several reasons. In the first place, the Senate is asked to put itself in the position of ordering that there be laid on the table of the Senate copies of correspondence between certain persons and the Victorian Government. What control have we over the correspondence of the Victorian Government? The Senate would simply be putting itself in a ludicrous position by passing a resolution that certain information should be obtained when it is quite impossible for us to obtain it. If it were correspondence between the Federal Government and any other Government, of which copies or the originals were in the possession of the Commonwealth Government, it would be a different matter ; but we are asked to say that there shall be laid upon the table of the Senate correspondence over which we have no control whatever. If there is one rule more than another that Ave ought to follow, undeviatingly, it is that we shall never pass a resolution ordering a thing to be done unless Ave have power to enforce its performance. I do not intend to elaborate this point. I think it is quite evident that the motion cannot be carried. There is another objection to the second paragraph of the motion, which asks that there shall be laid on the table of the Senate - </para>

                        <para>- I think that would be the better course. When these papers are produced, as no doubt they will be, if a reasonable request is made, they will be laid upon the table of the Senate, and members of both branches of the Legislature will have an opportunity of reading them. In the meantime I think it would be unwise to debate this question at any length, because it is a matter in which we have no concern. </para>

                    <para>- I doubt whether the position assumed by the Government on this question is the correct one. I imagine that if application is made to the Government of the State of Victoria for this information the reply will be - " The Commonwealth has taken over the Post and Telegraph department, and the Customs department. You have the information in your own hands, and why do you 'not give it to the Senate ? Do riot come to us. We cannot get it without applying to the Postmaster-General." </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing improper in passing this resolution. If it is adopted it will devolve upon the Government to get the information from the State of Victoria ; or, if the Government have the information, either in the Customs house or in the post-office, they can themselves furnish it to the Senate. I think it would be a round-about and a mistaken process, to ask the State to furnish the information, when they can turn round and say - "You have all the documents in your possession ; what necessity is there for asking us. If you had any doubt about the propriety of laying the papers on the table, you might have come to us, and asked us whether they might be laid on the table or not." I see no objection to the papers being laid upon the table, unless the Government can urge the objection that it is improper and impolitic for State reasons. I see no object in creating all this terrible difficulty and trouble. The Government will not tell us the truth. They will only tell us that the statements made on the other side are not strictly correct. They say the paper certainly was not suppressed ; or it was not done through the post-office ; but, on the other hand, there is a strong suspicion that it was done in the Customs. The passing of the resolution will clear the matter up, and we shall get the information, which, I have no doubt, is of an exceedingly harmless description; and hardly worth taking up all this time about. </para>

                        <para>- Surely it would be better to proceed in that way, and get the information on the subject in which he is interested, before moving a motion of this character. The second portion of the motion is in itself sufficient to justify the Senate in absolutely rejecting it. It asks us ' to lay upon the table copies of indecent advertisements. </para>

I will not consent to a motion so entirely vague in its terms; nor will I consent to a motion which practically commits the Senate to the expression of opinion that the newspaper has been suppressed . by the Victorian Government. We have no evidence whatever to justify us in passing a resolution asserting that the Victorian Government have suppressed this paper. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that if we are to have a good understanding among ourselves we ought to be a little careful in our procedure. An honorable senator may say that it is a question of form ; but questions of substance and questions of form at the early stages of the Commonwealth will be found to be very closely combined; and it is only by adopting good forms that we shall get the good substance. I think it is a very inexpedient thing to pass a motion of this kind. If honorable senators know all about it they do not want the papers. If they have a right to move, and it is within their jurisdiction, they have all the material in their hands to deal with the question.- But if they do not know all about it they have no right to urge the Government of Victoria - a State which is entitled to its rights - to lay upon this table the documents which they are desirous of seeing. I fancy that the honorable senator might have obtained, without a motion of this kind, precisely the same results, and without interfering with the rights of a State which may in its turn want to interfere with the rights of his own State, which he will be prepared to resent very vehemently. </para>

                    <para>- The only objection x can offer to the suggestion is that it will cause such an accumulation of documents and papers in the post-office. The period of one year has been previously found sufficient to insure safety. Documents are not destroyed before that term has expired. It is considered, however, that at the end of a year the danger of their being required as evidence will have ceased to exist. If they were kept for a longer period, a large accumulation would be caused. If an amendment to the effect suggested were restricted to telegrams there would not be so much inconvenience. It would, however, render it necessary to redraft the clause. I should think one year sufficient. </para>

                    <para>- This clause simply provides that mails should be delivered at the wharf nearest the post-office. It is not unreasonable to ask that a vessel shall deliver the mails at such a wharf. If a vessel is moored at any other wharf, it can send the . mails along so long as they are delivered to the persons deputed by the post-office to receive them. There can be no hardship involved. </para>

                        <para>- Is there any particular virtue in limiting the amount which may be transmitted by money order or postal note to £20, seeing the scattered nature of our population, and the fact that in the outside districts it is very often the case that much larger sums than £20 require to be remitted. In the old country much larger amounts are transmitted through the post office, and it appears to me desirable to increase the amount.  </para>

                        <para>- In some parts of the Commonwealth, in which the population is scattered, it is not satisfactory that there should be large sums of money at any of the postal offices, and if we issue postal orders to a very large amount we must make arrangements so that they can be met in whatever township the money is drawn upon. I would point out that no inconvenience ever happens in connexion with this matter, because the obvious intention of the statute is evaded by persons taking out a number of postal notes or orders if they want to send large sums of money. I am sorry that is done, and I wish that some means could be devised to prevent it, because it results in the evil that we try to avoid. One case occurred, within my knowledge, not very long ago, in which postal notes to a considerable amount were issued, and there was not sufficient money available to meet them. The money was required for a particular purpose in connexion with some mining matter, with the result was that the transaction miscarried, and there has been a considerable correspondence since, and a great deal of inconvenience has been caused. I think that considering the scattered nature of our population at the present time, we should not encourage the transmission through the Postal department of very large sums of money. For this reason I think there should be a limit, and the amount fixed in the Bill is the limit that has been adopted by all the States. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the Postmaster-General with regard to ' the inexpediency of having large sums of money at outlying offices. I have had a good deal of experience in connexion with institutions dealing with the remission of money, and I know that it would be impossible for the Government in outlying centres to keep such large balances as would enable them to cash money orders for hundreds of pounds. Possibly in a mining centre, where there is no bank, remittances would be sent up to £10,000. I think some provision might be made by which money orders could be sent up to an unlimited amount, to certain money order offices, which could be specified by regulation. But I totally disagree with the Postmaster-General, when he says we must not compete with private institutions. I think we certainly should compete with them, and if there is a profit to be made out of the transfer of money, I do not see why we should deny ourselves that profit, simply because we might infringe the supposed rights of private institutions. I quite agree with the Postmaster-General that the arrangement could not apply to all money order offices, because in outlying places to keep such enormous balances the Government would actually lose in interest more than the profit that might be made. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, especially where there are no banks. I know of many places of that kind in Western Australia. It is obvious that we cannot have these larger amounts issued on any money order office, but would it not be possible to apply the principle to some of the larger offices throughout Australia, and deal with the matter in the regulations. </para>

                        <para>- The English Post-office has been in the the habit of late years of carrying enormous sums of bullion, with the result that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam-ship Company have practically lost the whole of the freight on gold from India. The post-office carries up to £10,000 at one-fourth of the rate that the company used to charge.

                        <para>- -Of course Victoria now is very different from Victoria 50 years ago, but I would remind the honorable senator that there are places in Western Australia and Queensland which are just as primitive now as places in Victoria were 50 years ago. The fact of our being in a different position now from that in which we were so long ago only applies to some of the big centres. We are dealing now with the whole of the Commonwealth, and if we make an alteration of this kind it will apply just as much to the outlying parts as it would to the large towns. The difficulty caused by the smallness of the limit is more apparent than real, because it has always been got over in the way I have mentioned. If a person particularly wants to send £50, he gets two £20 money orders and one £10 order.- If we increased the amount to £50 and a man wanted to send £250, he would send five £50 orders. Increasing the limit will only be an encouragement to people to send larger and larger amounts. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; in Queensland some of them are. Within the last year we have had two pretty considerable robberies of money from the premises of a storekeeper who has been acting as postmaster. I can say from experience that it is undesirable that we should take any step in the direction of increasing the amount of money 'held by the local postmaster. </para>

                        <para>- The general feeling in the Senate hitherto has been against putting these matters in the hands of the Postmaster-General to 'deal with by regulation, and I have no desire that such an amendment should be made in this clause, because I think it is desirable that there should be uniformity and continuity of policy. It would not be a good thing that a Postmaster-General coming into office who might have ideas of his own on this subject should be able by regulation to make a change which afterwards might be found very inconvenient, and it would be unsatisfactory to have constant changes in a matter of this kind. A post.masterGeneral might come in who considered the limit should be £50 or £100, and alter the regulation accordingly, while perhaps the next Postmaster-General might have ideas in quite the opposite direction. I think the amount should be fixed ; £20 is the established limit, and it is well known throughout the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I think the Government ought to give every facility for the transmission of money. My experience in the West is that when the Government threw obstacles in the way of sending money from place to place they drove the business into the hands of private companies. Afterwards, when they tried to get it and the consequent revenue back, they failed. I think it is our duty to encourage as much as possible the transmission of money through the post-office. Where there is a good profit in the business to the Government. I do not see why we should not extend any operations so as to deal in large sums. In the way-back post-offices on the gold-fields of Western Australia, no matter how distant they may be, there never has been any fault found or any difficulty experienced in the transmission of money, and, so far as I can learn, there never has been any money lost. I submit that, instead of restricting, the Government ought to extend the business. </para>

                    <para>- I want to make a suggestion, because I am one of. those who believe in the Post and Telegraph department getting some of these pickings which we hear so much about. The objection which the Postmaster-General has raised is a reasonable one, namely, that it is not safe or wise to keep large sums at outlying places. But very little of that kind of business may be done at such places. I would suggest that the clause should be passed with the proviso that if a money order for a larger amount is wanted, a week's notice should be given before payment is required. In that case they could send money to any amount. If the department had the money they could pay it, and if they had not enough money, the notice would be sufficient to enable them to" get it. That would give the department every chance to make all the revenue it can for the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- That ii quite possibly the practice of other . post offices. We have always been in the habit of getting three or four money - orders when we wanted to send more than the limit. The object in limiting the amount to £10 or £20 is for the convenience of the post-office, and to issue orders for convenient' sums. So with postal notes. It would be very awkward to have postal notes for £20 issued. The post-office is usually had resort to by the poorer people, and it would be very inconvenient, perhaps, for them to have to take such notes. </para>

                        <para>- Increasingly, no doubt, by the commercial public. A £1 postal note is like a £1 bank note ; it is a very convenient vehicle of exchange, and that is the only object in having them. Therefore, it. seems to me that we are discussing something which does not arise under the clause. If a man wants to send £100 by the post-office it appears to me that he can do so by taking out five money orders. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to state' the practice which is adopted. We consider that, strictly speaking, a man who wants to send money through the post-office is limited to the amount of £20, but if he requires two money orders of £20 each, the practice has been to find out by wire whether there is money available to meet them. But even then there is a difficulty. Money orders on an office may be issued simultaneously at a great number of different offices. It is the simplest matter in the world, if any one so desired, to' break a money order office, because even the regulation about sending a wire to find out the state of things will not help us in a case where money orders on one office are issued at several different places. </para>

                    <para>- There have been cases - and I mentioned one j ust now - where there has not been sufficient- money at a local post office to meet the demands upon it, and great inconvenience resulted therefrom. It might happen, of course, if the limit were lower even than it is ; but still I think it is inadvisable to increase the limit, because the higher it is made the greater must be the risk of money orders being presented at an office where there is no money to meet them. </para>

                    <para>- How can the Postmaster-General so arrange his business? There are things which he may do, and things which he must do. He has to send £20, for that is the business which is thrown on him. If he has no money at the place where the money order is payable, he has to get it there somehow or other. If he has more money there than is necessary, then, in his discretion, he can allow half-a-dozen money orders for£20 to be drawn. He has to send£20, and he can send more if he has the money to meet the order. One is compulsory and the other is discretionary ; and, to my mind, the sending of £20 is quite enough to make compulsory, for I can very well understand, from the knowledge which the Minister has shown of the department, that it would be exceedingly inconvenient, if not impossible, to do more. </para>

                        <para>- To carry the argument to the extreme, the honorable senator might make the limit£1,000. The idea is that if half-a-dozen persons ask separately for money orders for£20, the Postmaster-General has to give them and to meet them. We have to take all these provisions into consideration in connexion with the probabilities of the circumstances which will arise in our ordinary experience, and that is why I think the Minister is wise when he says, "We know what cash we have at different places on which we are asked for money orders. If we have only£20, there we only issue a money order for£20. If a person wants half-a-dozen money orders for that sum, we telegraph and find out whether the post office has more than the sum in hand, and if it has we grant them." Will not honorable senators, on consideration, see that that is the wiser way to leave it ? We make the Minister send £20, and we leave him a discretion to send more, which of course he will do, if he has the money available at the other end to meet the money orders. </para>

                    <para>- 1 think that the currency of a postal note should be extended from six months to twelve months, because six months .is altogether too short. Postal notes are issued for small sums, and if a man receives a postal note for a small sum, and does not think it worth his while to cash it within that time; the money is practically lost to him. </para>

                    <para>- Postal notes are issued for the purpose of sending small sums by post instead of enclosing a bank note. If a person wants to send only 10s. or 15s. he gets a postal note for that amount and sends it by post. It is to' the advantage of the post-office if postal notes never come back. All we have to do is to provide that after the expiry of six months a postal note shall only be payable in gold or coin at the General Post-office of the State in which it is issued, and there will be no trouble. What do we do now ? We get a postal note for 10s., which we pay into our banking account, and which the bank collects in Adelaide. Hardly a case occurs in which a postal note is sent to the post-office to be changed. </para>

                        <para>- It is not done in South Australia, where a ,man pays his postal note away to his storekeeper or to a tradesman. It is received by the tradesman like a bank note, and is paid into the bank, which collects the money from the central authority. All that it is necessary to do is to print on their face that the postal notes are not payable in cash except at the central office of the State, and we shall have a lot of postal notes circulating for ever. If they do not come back, so much the better for the department. The object in issuing them in small amounts is not to come into competition with the banks. That is the idea. The Government issue a note of less value than one pound for the convenience of the public, and because the banks do not issue such a note. The Government make it possible to cash these notes at any money order office throughout the Commonwealth, but they say that the notes shall not remain good for more than a certain length of time. The reason they give for this in the first place is that they do not want to come into competition with the banks; and, secondly that they do not want to have a number of notes presented for payment at small local offices, where, very often, the cash in hand would not be sufficient to meet the payments. But there is not the slightest reason why these notes should not be made payable in cash at a central office. In Queensland there might be three central offices, for this purpose. In 'Victoria and South Australia it would be quite sufficient to have one central office - at Melbourne and Adelaide respectively. I do not see why, if we can make a profit and at the same time confer advantages on the public, we should not do so. </para>

                        <para>- The Commonwealth Government can issue notes for smaller amounts than the banks do. We need not trouble ourselves whether the notes issued come back for payment or not. The more there are lost or destroyed the better for. the Commonwealth. As for legislating that the notes shall only be payable for six months, and that after that time the Government will charge interest upon them, I say that there is no necessity to do anything of the kind. The practice of charging poundage was established in South Australia because of the fears of the Postmaster-General that a large number of notes might be presented at one particular time at one particular up-country office. That is a mistaken idea altogether. It was also desired that the Government should not come into competition with the banks any more than could be avoided. There need be no fear about the matter at all, and we might just as well strike out the whole clause. </para>

                    <para>- I have given notice of an amendment in clause 78, but I find that a similar amendment will have to be made in clause 77. The amendment is, to insert after the word "lines" (line 3) the words "other than private lines." We are all agreed that the direction and control of all public telephones -and telegraph lines should be in the hands of the Postmaster-General. It is to the interests of the public generally that that control should be vested in him. But there his authority should stop. I do not see why the Postmaster-General should be allowed to interfere with private telephones and telegraphs. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am now erecting one upon a station in the Western district which I have purchased for my son. But there are some stations which are crossed by roads, some of which are used and some are not. The difficulty in those cases has been that for some reason or other the Telegraph department, not only in Victoria, but in other States, has set its. face against these private lines, and has hampered the erection of them . by demanding very heavy fees for the right of crossing public roads. In some cases the department has prohibited lines from crossing the roads. That is the reason why I seek to provide that a landowner shall be permitted to erect a telegraph or telephone wire at a height not less than IS feet above the road. I hope honorable senators will agree with me that, so far from placing difficulties in the way, the erection of these private wires should he encouraged as much as possible. </para>

                    <para>- They can erect these wires upon their own property, but as soon as they cross a public road the department comes in and takes control. I do not think power ought to be given to private individuals to stretch wires not under the control of the Telegraph department across the public roads. In some States the system prevails of giving the right to private persons who desire to erect a wire for their own particular benefit to do it on the payment of a nominal sum, such as £1, by way of an admission of the telegraph monopoly of the State. That condition is imposed because it is not desired that any question concerning the rights of the State should crop up in future. </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General tells us that the practice has been to give the utmost possible scope to the establishment of these lines. Let me instance to him a case that I am personally acquainted with. A station that my son has is 18 miles from Hamilton, and there is a line of 'telephone posts running within 7 miles of it. Wo were told that wo could have a telephone if we paid .the cost of the line. Then four other neighbours wanted a telephone line, and it was decided to ascertain how we could get a line or telephone wire from Hamilton to these four stations. The first one who applied was told - "The cost of the line will be £200, and you will have to pay interest on that." Then the next one applied, and he was told - "We will do it for you; the cost is £200, and you will have to pay interest on the £200." The same answer was given to the other two. So that four persons then would be paying interest on £200, or, in other words, the- State demanded interest on £800, and was only expending £200. That is what is called giving assistance to private lines. </para>
