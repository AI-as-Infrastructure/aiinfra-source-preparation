                        <para>- There is nothing about the matter in the standing orders. I apprehend that any one who comes in to listen to the debates is entitled to take a note if he so desires. We do not discriminate between visitors. We have reporters from all the States, who take notes in different parts of the House, but, of course, not on the floor of the Chamber. And I know of nothing which should prevent other visitors from doing so. I do not think there is any rule to prevent any person from reading a book. </para>

                <para>Seldom, indeed, are there more than three children to a marriage ; and half of the children do not survive infancy. And yet it is the universal experience in India and all other tropical places which the English have conquered. The honest and respectable (though not intelligent) labouring gentlemen who control the various Governments of Australia have made up their minds that they can make water run np hill, that an Act of Parliament will enable the British race to breed iii a hot climate ; and nothing that a humble scientist can say is likely to alter their opinion. At the same time, I would warn people that the Aliens und Kanaka Acts are not likely to work as they are expected. True, we shall keep out the kanaka, because he is a decent, quiet, timid sort of man, not given to leaving his comfortable island for laborious purposes : but Asiatics will smuggle themselves in, and take his place. This will be very good for the sugar-former, but I fancy it is not exactly what the labour party desire. They do take these things so seriously : but why not take the trouble to look into matters a little, to find out what is, and what is not, possible ? ' </para>

                    <para>I am not content when .1 look forth upon the people of Queensland at this present moment. I have never known an instance which so emphatically brings to my mind the story of the Irishman, who proclaimed, that he would have peace if he had to murder every mother's son in the place. In Queensland 1 remember when the price of sugar went up very rapidly, and when the people went forth and seized upon the land at a far greater price than it was worth in face of that rise : and we all remember how, very soon after, when sugar Fell, 'these people were ruined. But again they went out and occupied their lands and produced more sugar, and laboured under great trouble, and just as they were turning the corner legislation turned them upside down. That was withdrawn after a little while, and they were allowed to go and seek prosperity again, and they have been getting on fairly well until now. It is certainly clear that in the Northern portion of Queensland the prospect of getting any other man than the kanaka to carry on that enterprise is difficult indeed. In all loyalty I submit to the better judgment of those whose business it is to inquire into the surroundings and the extent Of the difficulty, and to them I leave it with the fullest faith; but, while! hope fora white Australia, I trust we shall not try to get a white race with the whiteness of the desert. We want our products as abundant and constant as we can get them, and the means of liberal transport and price to us. If the Commonwealth will only produce the former, the second is ever ready. We have got the men, and have got the ships, and men courageous enough to find the money, too. </para>

                    <para>The kanakas' work in the field is to hoe the ground and keep the weeds free from the cane from three to four months, until the cane is of sufficient strength to kill the weeds. The next process is the trashing of the cane, that is, taking all the loose leaves from the cane to allow it to grow and mature properly. This process is gone through three times, that is if the planter wishes to have a good season. Mind you, this work is all done in the hottest part of the year. The first and second process is not so bad, as they can generally get a little breeze ; but the last one, when the cane is from 6 ft. to 7 ft. high, and at a temperature of about 160 degrees in the sun, and not a breath of air to be got, only the constant rays of the sun, I say it is simply unbearable. The white labour was tried on the Herbert River - which is about 60 miles north of Townsville - some years ago, but proved an utter failure. Once the cane is cut it wants to be taken to the mill as soon as possible - and this is where the difficulty occurs if the labour is not available, - for if allowed to lie three or four days it becomes sour and unfit for sugar-producing. So you see that if the planter does not get men he can rely on he will be on the wrong side of the ledger at the end of the season. </para>

                        <para>- I have considerable sympathy with them. White labourers, however, should have some sympathy for the employers. I think it is no kindness to the white man to ask him to trash cane in the tropical regions. In my opinion, he is capable of doing much better work for which his employers can afford to pay him better wages. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is none the less because of the circumstances to which the honorable senator refers, but it is a difficulty which, in my humble judgment, can only be solved justly and fairly by a thorough and impartial inquiry into the whole of the circumstances. If honorable senators are strong in their majority of five to one, let them not use their strength harshly to crush the minority. Let them be merciful, and consider that whether the minority are right or wrong they have material interests in this question. They have their money, and the prosperity which is associated with this industry in Queensland at stake. </para>

                    <para>Referring to the work which kanakas have to perform in the fields, the lecturer remarked that if gentlemen who talk so much about a white Australia would, only go to Queensland and do a little work in the plantations on a hot day, they would change their political opinions in a very few hours. White men cannot do the work, and he quite agreed with the contention that it was not white men's work. He pointed out that the kanakas were allowed, similar rations to those supplied to men on cattle and sheep stations, with the addition of rice. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear it so emphatically said. My honorable friend is as impulsive as a young colt. I thought that a little consideration might have induced him to change his opinion again. He says the reason is that he disapproves of the introduction of the kanakas into Queensland at all. Very good. -Under the Bill it is proposed to extend their introduction for a certain number of years. If he is going to do justice to the planters and farmers, and he is satisfied that further time is necessary, what has the original wrong to do with the question ? </para>

But the point for consideration is how best to do it with the goodwill of those affected by it ; and it is far better for us to err. largely on the side of liberality of treatment than to make the people of Queensland feel that the first result to them of the establishment of the Commonwealth Parliament is a burning sense of injustice. </para>

                        <para>- I wish I could accept that assurance. But we cannot read the debates, the resolutions which have been pouring in upon us from all quarters of Queensland, and the letters which have been quoted in this Chamber, without coming to the conclusion that there is an underlying sense of wrong on the part of the great body of the people of that State. At the outset of the career of this great Parliament, it behoves us to be careful of raising asperity of feeling and bringing about a state of things which may sow the seeds of future difficulties, and mar that harmony which we all hope will insure to us the very greatest advantages from the establishment of our union. </para>

The trouble is that white men will not accept such wages as an agricultural industry can afford to pay. Men who are accustomed to eight hours a day and ls. an hour will not work twelve hours a day at cane-cutting and. earn only 30Si a week and their rations. </para>

Their carryings on are seen and. heard by school children and decent living people. At what price do we keep on black labour ? The kanaka and his low white companions are a curse to cling to the minds of the innocent young children that are to form the people of this great Commonwealth. Then there are the Yokohama brothels, within a stone's throw of the State school. Here low whites and semi-savage kanakas are to be seen satisfying lust ; and this is in a so-called civilized community, in broad daylight, where the minds of the young are moulded into various channels. </para>

                <para>We must be one in knowledge - knowledge of each other. This trite remark impresses itself upon me, particularly in regard to Queensland. Your vast territory, probably but imperfectly known to the bulk of your own people, possesses products and problems peculiar to itself, still less mastered by your southern neighbours. My ignorance is shared by many others. Our southern conditions, though doubtless in many respects novel to you, are more likely to be comprehended by you than your situation is to be grasped by us. One pf the first tasks of the Commonwealth must be to make us better known to each other, and one of the many duties that still appeal to fill true federationists, will be to remove misunderstandings, overcome local prejudices, and to listen to the views of those who, geographically remote from us, have separate interests and aims. We must listen to the men who are carrying on the work of settlement in the far north and the far west. </para>
                <para>It is in this spirit that we must enter on our national life if federation is to be a blessing to all the States ; and it will be ominous of disaster to the future of the Commonwealth if its foundations are to be laid in the shifting sand bank of prejudice and political emergency rather than on the solid rock of equity and justice. </para>

                    <para>- And the sugar industry of Queensland is to be ruthlessly destroyed. Honorable senators will find that out, and it will recoil on them some day. There is no industry the destruction of which will throw so many men out of employment, or occasion such disaster, as the sugar industry of Queensland. Queensland has already suffered severely. This Bill will simply strike another blow at her prosperity, and her credit and financial position. I appeal to the committee on the ground of the justice of this amendment. Even if it was thought that the other amendment which I proposed was too harsh, it surely cannot be said that I am now asking too much. I appeal especially to the representatives of Queensland. It is for them to see that Queensland .is not unfairly treated on this occasion. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment is, I think, entitled to be considered an entirely moderate one, especially when we take it in conjunction with clauses of the Bill which show that its restrictive effect would begin to be felt on. the 1st of January next. The Bill requires that after the close of this year licences shall be required, and. these can only be granted for three-fourths of the number of kanakas that have returned this year. Therefore, when the 1st of January arrives the question would immediately arise as to whether certain persons applying for licences were, entitled to them. Surely, it is a little too severe that the restrictive effect of the Bill should begin to be felt within one month. </para>

Therefore, it was left an open question, with the risk to the planter that the Government might take steps at any time to get rid of this coloured labour.

                    <para>We were bound to recognise the position and to face the causes of our condition with remedies, and that- is what we have attempted to do. We saw plainly that there was one very prominent point in which we had failed in past legislation, and that we had by our legislation hurt an industry that might have been prosperous now. That was the sugar industry in the north. We saw that plainly. It was plain to any man who went north. He had only to go to the towns to see the effect, not because there were starving black fellows there, but because he would find starving white men in all the towns, although he would see evident vestiges of the towns having been much larger in past years. That can be seen from Brisbane right up to Cooktown. Then if he went into the interior a little, and visited the plantations, he would find that what were formerly scenes of industry now show a decaying industry, and an industry which is bound to go unless some means are adopted to keep it in existence. </para>

                    <para>There may, however, be reluctance on the part of the people of the northern part of the continent to intrust the uncontrolled exercise of this power to a Legislature in which the majority would necessarily represent the people of other parts different in climate and natural conditions, and might have no adequate knowledge of the real nature of the Social and material aspects of the problems with which they are called upon to deal. But the probability is the representatives of the nation would rise to the occasion, and would decline to do any act that might inflict disaster on any part of the continent merely in obedience to a popular cry. The gravity of the matter with regard to both external and domestic consequences would be felt to be so great that it could not fail to exercise that steadying influence which the undertaking of great responsibilities has almost always exercised amongst the British race. Perhaps all that can at present be asserted with confidence on this subject is that the future social history of northern Australia will depend upon the effect which its climate produces on the European races - an effect which is still quite problematical, and on which little, if any, light is thrown by history. This .is indeed so obvious to unprejudiced observers that it may be anticipated, with some degree of confidence, that a Federal Parliament, imbued with a due sense of its responsibility, would not until it is in possession of much fuller knowledge than is at present attainable permit airy action which would result either in the general substitution within any part of the territory under its control of Asiatic for European civilisation, or in the definite condemnation of any part of that territory to barrenness and desolation. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I see that it is inconsistent to say, on the one hand, that the industry is going -to be ruined, and on the other hand, that it will be saved if we give the planters seven years in which to make the change. We only ask for the extension in order that the planters may have time to make fresh arrangements, and endeavour to get capital from their friends. I do not believe that they will be able to get it from the financial institutions. It will give them more time to consider whether they should give up the calling of a lifetime </para>

                        <para>- That may probably be one of the schemes which may be tried, but it will be no consolation to the citizens of the Commonwealth, who desire to see it progress, that there are flourishing plantations in New Guinea, when the output of sugar decreases, and thousands of our citizens are more or less' ruined in making the change. The same problem will still exist, and we shall still have to decide what we are to do with the tropical parts of the Commonwealth. If we are going to acquire these territories, including the. New Hebrides, later, as I hope we may, it will remain a very important question to decide what we shall do with the natives. </para>

                        <para>- No ; under the clause of the Constitution under which we may acquire territories, it is provided that they shall have such representations as the Parliament of the Commonwealth thinks fit. Their people will be practically citizens . of the Commonwealth, and there is no power to pass laws excluding them from the Commonwealth of which they form a part. We could not do it.

                        <para>- It only shows how unreal this sentiment is to tell us that there are 1,000 of these men, whose agreements have run out, and who are walking at large about the towns of Queensland. That brings me to the clause providing for the deportation of kanakas, and I do not believe that any one of them will ever be deported. I shall be surprised to see that clause passed. I do not think we have the power to pass it, or that it would be just to pass it. Everything goes to show that the feeling in Queensland is not what it is made out to be, and I think that honorable senators would do well to go out a step to meet these planters, and make friends and not enemies of them. </para>

                    <para>- I must say that the honorable senator is travelling outside the amendment to a very large extent ; but by general consent, early in the debate, it was understood that certain questions at issue of a somewhat historical nature should be dealt with. I was obliged, in consequence of that understanding, to allow a little latitude; but I fear that it has been unduly availed of. This certainly is in excess of what is justly allowable. </para>

                        <para>- The matter is one of considerable difficulty. The standing orders are not definite upon the subject, but from the inquiries I have made from various sources, including the President and the Clerk, I learn that the practice, where these standing orders have been in force for some 40 years, is to allow no discussion whatever upon such a motion. The standing order bearing on the subject is No. 163 - </para>

When the Bill was previously before the Senate I was inclined to- ask honorable members to sit later than four o'clock, but as it was represented to me that a number of honorable senators desired to catch their trains, I agreed not to do so, but distinctly said that I expected substantial progress to be made to-day. We are only one line further on with the Bill now than we were on Friday afternoon, and though I should not like to say that time has been wasted, honorable senators might have curtailed some of the speeches which have been made. It is desirable that we should get on with this Bill in order to make way for other work to-morrow, and there is plenty of time this evening to make some progress. </para>

                    <para>- In my speech on the second reading of the BUI, I .drew attention to the extraordinary character of this clause, and I have not heard any explanation from the Postmaster-General as to how it is to be worked. The sugar industry of Queensland is riot in the hands of one person, but is in the hands of two or three thousand settlers, and how we are to apply this clause to the operations of two or three thousand settlers I cannot understand. Nearly all of these settlers use kanaka labour. A number are dispensing every month with certain kanakas who are at liberty to re-engage, but they will not all be able to engage in the proportion herein fixed. Supposing that 100 or 200 farmers part with some of their kanakas during the first half of next year, how will their right to re-engage three fourths of them be arranged under the clause ? Is it proposed under the power to make regulations to prescribe the method without reference to the Senate ? </para>

                        <para>- It will be met by regulations. The substance of the clause is perfectly clear. If 1,000 kanakas have been returned during 1901, then only 750 can be imported during 1902. The method by which these licences will be issued must be dealt with by regulation by the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- The standing orders of other Houses allow the Chairman to be moved out of the chair, and on such a motion the universal practice has been in these States to allow an opportunity of discussing the question. We have to 'be care- f'u-1 to protect om1 liberties and our freedom of speech within reasonable bounds, and ought to see that no attempt is made to curtail those liberties. Of course, if a rule is laid down and accepted by the Senate, it becomes the practice of the Senate for the time being, but until something of that kind is done, I submit that it is not only wrong, but mischievous, that any attempt should be made to restrict fair and reasonable debate. The President, as the highest officer of the Senate, is the man to whom we look to protect our liberties. We, therefore, appeal to you, sir, for your ruling, feeling sure that on a matter of this kind you will have no desire to -restrict the opportunities of honorable senators for discussing matters to which they happen to be opposed. Minorities should !be allowed the fullest opportunity of expressing opinions to which they desire to give expression. </para>

                        <para>- I was the senator who moved that progress be reported. I submit that such a motion is different from an ordinary motion for the adjournment of the . debate. Of course, the Chairman leaving the chair would be an interruption of the debate, but there is a vast difference between - moving an adjournment and moving an absolute interruption of- the entire proceed ing a. I took the step I did expressly for the purpose of securing an- opportunity of saying one or two words. I had no desire to block the proceedings. On the contrary, my wish was to facilitate business. I should not have moved the motion except for the purpose of making a personal explanation. That in itself is a reason against the ruling of the Chairman in committee from which I dissent in all possible good faith. I hold that unless there is an opportunity afforded for giving reasons for moving the Chairman out of the chair no such motion could ever be moved with any hope of being carried. It would be futile to move it. I mention these points because it seems to me we have a right to explain why the Chairman ought to leave the chair. </para>

                    <para>- I shall have occasion probably to debate this clause at very great length. I made a courteous proposal to the Postmaster-General just now, to which he was not courteous enough to reply. I suggested that, as clause 8  was a debatable one, we should proceed as far as clause 7 and then report progress. I have assisted in passing clauses 4, 5, 6, and 7, and I would appeal to the Postmaster-General to have consideration for those honorable senators who were travelling last night - -not only from New South Wales, but from other States - and to agree to an adjournment at this late hour. At no time have I obstructed the passing of this Bill, and we are likely to have a more friendly discussion to-morrow than we can possibly have now when our tempers have got a 'little bit strained. I have only spoken once dining the sitting. </para>

I failed to respond not from any want of courtesy. I am disappointed with the progress which we have made with this Bill. It is true that we have passed four clauses one after the other. But, from 2.30 p.m. until eleven p.m., the committee lias been discussing one clause of two lines. Dining the second reading, the questions of the extension of time and of the deportation of kanakas were thoroughly discussed, and scarcely anything has been added to the discussion to-day that is new. </para>

                        <para>- That would be of no advantage, because these questions of deportation and extension of time are the only ones that have been discussed. We have been engaged for two days in dealing with the question of extension of time, and directly we come to the second point we are asked to adjourn, and to start again to-morrow. It would not be fair to agree to adjourn now. There is other important business coming forward to-morrow, and if we do not get the Bill through committee to-night, that business will be displaced. There are other reasons known to the. Senate why it is desirable to push on with business. I propose to go on with the Immigration Restriction Bill to-morrow if we dispose of this measure to-night. 1 </para>

                    <para>- I am sorry that the Postmaster-General does not see fit to consent to the adjournment. Until &amp; few moments ago I was under the impression that he had made a promise to adjourn at this stage, and I know that one or two honorable senators who have paired and gone away are under the same impression. No doubt this clause is subsidiary to clause 3, but it is of sufficient importance to justify full consideration in committee. It provides for the return of kanaka labourers to their homes, and the question arises as to what power we have to pass a clause of this kind. The question also comes up as to whether it is reasonable that such a clause should be in the Bill. ' There will be no possibility of importing kanakas after a certain date, and before that date they will only be allowed to come in in very limited numbers. Therefore their numbers must decrease, and it is a question of policy whether power should be placed in the hands of any officer, where he has cause to believe that a kanaka is not employed under agreement, to bring him before a court of summary jurisdiction, and for us to provide that - </para>

                <para>I do not know whether the question has been tested in a court of law, as to whether an islander can be compelled to return to his island, but we have one case in Queensland where a large number of islanders were deported, and as the action taken in deporting them has never been called in question it must be admitted as going a long way to show that Queensland under Queensland laws has successfully claimed the right of deporting islanders. I propose to quote from Votes and Proceedings of the Queensland Parliament for 1885, volume 2, page 1053. By way of preface I should explain that previous to 1885, eight vessels had brought islanders to Queensland, and a question was raised as to whether those islanders had been legally recruited, in consequence of their not having known what were the terms of their engagement. A Royal commission was appointed on the 23rd December to inquire into the matter. They reported that these islanders did not understand the nature of their agreement, and in consequence of that they were ordered by the Governor in Council to be returned to their islands. Honorable senators considering the legal aspect of the case will be interested in this extract from the Minutes of Proceedings of the Executive Council of Queensland of 4th May, 1885 - </para>

                        <para>- I think there is no section in any of the Queensland Acts exactly corresponding to this. All the Queensland Acts apparently contemplate that the islander shall, on the termination of his engagement, return to his island ; because after providing that the engagement shall be for three years, the Acts and regulations go on to provide that the employer shall each year pay a certain amount of money towards paying his passage back. There was an understanding from that that the islander should go back, but there was nothing to prevent him from entering into a fresh engagement instead. With regard to this expression, "return to the place from which he was originally brought," it has been pointed out that some of the kanakas have engaged again and again, and have been a long time in Australia. It is possible that the island, or part of the island, from which they were imported may have become almost depopulated, or may have become an unsuitable place to which to return them. Again, changes may have taken place which would render it unsafe for them to be landed at the places from which they were originally brought. I am willing to agree to an amendment omitting those words, with a view to substituting for them the words "deported from." I therefore move - </para>

                        <para>- What kind of a condition of legislative insanity are we getting into when a Minister of the Crown will blandly move such a proposition? Surely ho must recognise that it is time to go home when he proposes that the Governor-General in Council shall have authority to do what no Government in the world has ever attempted to claim as a right - to take people living within its own borders, and dump them down in any part of creation it pleases. The Postmaster-General must be insane, or, to use another phrase, suffering from brain fag, to make such a proposition. There is no such provision on the statute-book of any nation. I recognise that he is quite right in not desiring to make it obligatory to re-deliver a kanaka at some place which may now be depopulated, but this amendment is really too eccentric to be considered. Surely he can submit an amendment more consonant with common sense and international law ? </para>

                        <para>- I suppose this clause is intended to affect the 1,000 kanakas, who, it is said, are now in Queensland, and are not under any engagement. I would like the honorable and learned senator to say whether he has considered the case of any of these men who may have rented cottages, who may have entered into contracts of service, or who may be conducting a business in any way. It cannot be said that I have been guilty of obstruction upon this measure, and I do not know what I have done that I should be compelled to work here when I am absolutely unfit for it. </para>

                        <para>- The question of the exemptions was fully dealt with on the interpretation clause. I think there can be no doubt that this clause will apply to any islander who comes within the definition given in that clause. </para>

Their present wages are deplorably low - somewhere about 2s. 6d. a week; but, inasmuch ox the consensus of opinion is that the planters should have five years under present conditions in which to make arrangements for doing away with kanakas, I shall not move the clause of which I have given notice. </para>
