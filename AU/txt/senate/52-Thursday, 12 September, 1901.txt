          <para>- Of course, sir, there can be no objection to the suspension of the standing orders, when the report is adopted. But the remark you made suggests whether this is exactly the form, as a matter for future guidance, in which it ought to be done. The better way and it would be more in accordance with usage, would be for the notice of motion to be contingent upon the adoption of the committee's report on the Bill. That is the way in which I think it was always done under your own guidance in the Legislative Council, and also in the other Chamber in South Australia. If the report is not adopted on the same day, it looks as though a resolution were passed which could only come into operation on a future date. The effect, of course, is exactly the same if it is moved as a contingent notice of motion. </para>

            <para>- I am simply pointing out that this clause, when brought into operation, will at any rate allow the States and the Commonwealth to agree at once, without any trouble or difficulty, as to what particular loan shall be taken over ; because it will make no difference whatever to the State whether the Commonwealth takes over a loan at 4 per cent., at 4£, or at 5. The actuarial equivalent will be exactly the same - not in amount, but in result ; so that this clause will prevent any difficult question of that kind arising. </para>

            <para>- That is one strong reason why we should hesitate to allow the Commonwealth to assume this basis of 3 per cent. But there is a further reason.. Even where the States are in the happy position of having borrowed at, we will say, 3-J- per cent., I ask the committee to remember that probably in every such case the State has only succeeded in getting the rate of interest reduced because it has accepted less than par value. In other words, near] v every 3£ per cent, loan has, I suppose, been floated at £95 or £96, or something under par. </para>

Section 87 does not provide that three-fourths shall be paid over, but that three-fourths subject to the deduction provided for in section89 shall be paid over.

            <para>- I am not going to be asked to calculate for a period of years, at the rate of interest which happens to be ruling at 3 o'clock upon a given day. I prefer to take the interest we find existing over a considerable series of years. I think it is right to take notice of the fact that there has been for a long period a gradual tendency to a reduction of interest. Of course there is at times a reaction, but the tendency exists all the same. At the present moment, undoubtedly, Australian loans might be reckoned at about 3-| per cent, instead of 3 per cent., but if we are guided by the experience of the last 10 years, I think we can fairly come to the conclusion that 3 per cent, is a fair representation of the amount. There is another point to be remembered, and it is that 3 per cent, is not to be paid to the State on the amount of their individual loans, but on the estimated value of the properties taken over. If a property which has cost the State £100,000 has risen ip. value to. £150,000, it is credited to the State at £150,000, and the State receives 3 per cent, on that amount, which will be £4,500. So that, when the State is paying 4 per cent, interest on the £100,000 it will still be in pocket, although the amount of interest received from the Commonwealth is only 3 per cent. The question as to whether we should make it 3 per cent, or 3£ per cent, is really not worth spending time over, but another point to which I must direct the attention of the committee is that if we allow the States 3£ per cent., we shall have to charge them 3£ per cent., and it practically comes back again to the same thing. After ten years have passed, the finances may be in a different position, but within a period of ten years it does not seem to make very much difference whether the rate charged to the State be 3 per cent, or 3 J per cent. For the reasons I have given, I believe that 3^ per cent, fairly represents the financial requirements, not of to-day, yesterday, or ' to-morrow, but of the period of years in which we are living. </para>

            <para>- The revenue from the Post-office will pay for those services, at all events within a few hundred thousand pounds. We have to pay for the telegraph and post-offices, but we take over the marine. Surely if the Braddon clause were strictly adhered to £2,000,000 would be ample for all our purposes. Therefore, what is the use of raising the point at the present time? I understand that the Government propose to raise £8,500,000. </para>

        <para>Senator Sir FREDERICK SARGOOD.The proviso says that the balance shall be paid to the several States in accordance with the Constitution. That to my mind makes a very great difference and brings in section 89.

            <para>- It continues the same principle. In regard to the principle to be adopted, I think that the new paragraph provides for the most equitable and reasonable way of dealing with the subject, but I hold that the clause will have to be considerably altered. It is all very well to say that the Commonwealth is to become responsible, but we must provide how the interest is to be paid. The only case of the kind I know of is that, in the Act under which the Metropolitan Board of Works here took over about £2,000,000 of the State's loans, it was provided that the interest should be paid three months before it was due in London to the State Treasurer, in order that he might remit it to London. In the same way it will be necessary here to provide that the principal for which the Commonwealth makes itself liable shall be paid three months before it is due in London, in order that it may be remitted. It is not sufficient, in my opinion, to leave it in this bald manner - to merely say that the Commonwealth shall become responsible to the State. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps my honorable friend was not here when I mentioned that it will be necessary to have a document of some kind settling the rights of the parties under this provision, because it gives the Commonwealth the power to become responsible for the debt, but the details of the responsibility, the modes and places of payment, are matters to be settled by the deed of contract. </para>

            <para>- It is a matter of such importance, involving such large responsibility, that it would be infinitely better that the clause should contain the leading principles on which it is to be carried out. I do not think that we should trust to regulations. I think 3 per cent, is too low. Certainly it is lower than any of the States have been able to borrow money at. </para>

            <para>- Assuming that it would be 3£ per cent., we have the fact that a loan floated by the most favoured State is only able to be floated at that rate of interest. The loans of the other States, of course, have not been floated under such favorable circumstances. The business of the Commonwealth being to indemnify the States, subject to the principle that it ought not to pay according to cost, but according to valuation, I want to know where is the justification for the proposal now before the committee? The Commonwealth and the States have a common interest. They are in that respect all one. The Commonwealth cannot get on unless the States get on also, and the States cannot get on unless the Commonwealth gets on. We are all one concern, and we have only for convenience arranged to amalgamate in respect to several things. The result will only be a success in proportion to the degree in which we work fairly with each other. What is the good of saying - " How can the Common wealth do this?" and "How can the States do that ?" If the Commonwealth takes over the property of the States without doing justice to them how can the States get along at all ? If the Commonwealth takes over from South Australia properties that are bringing in a really good revenue and paying the State well, and the Commonwealth says - "We are going to take these properties at a great loss to you," where is the justice of that ? Surely there must be something fail1 and reasonable in the transaction. The very wording of the agreement between us from the beginning was that the Commonwealth should take over certain properties of the States which might be better managed by the Commonwealth than by the States, on terms of indemnifying the States to the extent of the values as against the liability of the States ; or that the Commonwealth should pay for them in cash, which would be an end to all things. But this 3 per cent, interest payment is, to my mind, simply absurd. Even 3J per cent, will not be enough ; though, certainly, 3£ per cent: would be better than 3. I sincerely .hope that the rate will be considerably increased, in order to indemnify the States on the principle which the Constitution intended in respect of the way in which the properties should be taken over. </para>

When we take into consideration the fact that the sources of revenue are limited by the operations of the Braddon section of the Constitution, we should be careful before we raise the percentage to 3½ ; and I shall require to hear further reasons before I feel justified in voting for the increase. </para>

            <para>- I have called attention to the words of the section in order to show that it does not say indent! nity. If it meant indemnity that intention would have been expressed in the Constitution. We had many able and eminent men in the Convention which prepared the Constitution, including my honorable and learned friend himself, who had great influence there, and who certainly would have been able to carry a proposal, if the sense of justice of the members of the convention leant that way, to make this an indemnity instead of a question of payment upon "just terms." But the reason why the Convention made the provision as it stands was that it was recognised that the Commonwealth in its early days would have large expenditure forced upon it, and would have to take over a large amount of property. The Commonwealth has forced upon it, under the section which hands over the transferred services, over £10,000,000 of property. That has got to be paid for. The States have to be compensated on " just terms," and we have to see what "just terms " are. Now, with all respect to honorable senators who have spoken about the loans of the States, I say that we have nothing to do with the percentage which has been paid on loans raised by the States. In the first place, in many States large public works which have come over to us have not been paid out of loan money at all. </para>

            <para>- We have nothing to do with the interest paid by the States. We have no knowledge of what has been paid by them in past yeai'3, or what they may be paying now for their loans. We have to say what is a fair thing to allow under all the circumstances. The Commonwealth takes over these properties. A large number of them, as I have said, are forced upon the Commonwealth, or are transferred by virtue of the Constitution. The Commonwealth has to pay for them. What is the object of asking the Commonwealth to pay a larger amount of interest? Surely regard must always be had to the credit of a person who owes money. If one has the best possible security a less rate of interest is charged. If one has not so good a security a larger rate of interest is charged. Here we have the best possible security in the world in the security of the Commonwealth - a security which, I assume, comes next, if it is not equal, to the security of Great Britain herself. What better security could there be ? The next consideration is at what rate would a State itself be able to invest this money ? If this amount of compensation, estimated at some £10,000,000, were distributed to the different States in cash, what use would they be able to make of it ? Would they, if they invested it in the ordinary way, be able to make more than 3 per cent, out of it? </para>

            <para>- Of course the Commonwealth could not get them for nothing ; but I am pointing out now the difference between the position of the States before these properties were taken over and after they were taken over. There is a question now of \ per cent, difference of interest between my views of what is just, and the views of some other honorable senators, and I say that in considering the question of whether we shall saddle the Commonwealth with the payment for all time of \ per cent, more interest, we must have regard to all the circumstances I have been pointing out. I have shown that in respect of these properties the States will be in the position of receiving, by the proposal to fix the rate at 3 per cent., no less than £46,200 per annum in interest which they would never have received before. Quarantine is another item of the same kind which has to be taken over, though it is not taken over yet, and it is something that does not produce any revenue to the States. The compensation in respect of that is estimated at £81,000, and the interest payable upon that at 3 per cent, would be £2,430 per year. Then there is an estimated amount of £854,000 in connexion with coast and harbor lights. The interest on that amount at 3 per cent, is £24,620 a year. Taking all these works together, which at the present time are mere dead weight to the States, there will be an amount of £73,250 which the States will get in interest upon these dead works, as they may be described from the financial point of view, which they would not get if the Commonwealth had not taken over these properties. We must look at the transaction all round. On the one hand, the States hand over the whole of these properties to the Commonwealth. They hand over their revenue from Customs to the Commonwealth, and they hand over the transferred services to the Commonwealth ; but, on the other hand, they get large benefits from the Commonwealth. It is for the good of Australia that the transfers are made. It is the people of the States who make the transfers, and when they are made we must remember that in respect of many of the properties handed over they will get £73,250 in interest, which it would never have been in their power to earn if those properties had remained under the old condition of things. There is still another matter to be considered. In regard to the compensation payable for properties taken over, a very large portion will be in respect of the value of land transferred in each case. The Commonwealth will pay to a State the value of the property at the time of taking it over, practically its value at the present day, and honorable senators will see that in regard to all the States there is an immense amount of unearned increment attaching to these properties which the States will get the benefit of. Take, for instance, the case of a post-office like the Sydney Post-office, situated in the most valuable portion of the city. Putting it at the very lowest figure, I suppose the land there would be worth now something like from £1,000 to £1,200 a foot, and when it was originally acquired by the State, whether it was Crown lands or whether it was bought, £100 a foot would have been a very large amount to allow for it. That is only one illustration of a great many instances which will occur throughout the States and in every portion of Australia. And in the case of post-offices and other public buildings, the land on which they are erected will have cost the States a very small sum of money, and the Commonwealth will have to pay the States a very large sum of money for it, the States getting the benefit of the unearned increment. </para>

They must broaden their minds to the effect of what they are doing, on the Commonwealth beyond 5 years, and on the State even at the present time. When you make a larger amount of interest payable beyond what is really fair you burden the smaller States which have to make up a very large proportion of what has been lost elsewhere. </para>

          <para>- I intend to support the proposition of the Government on the question of the rate of interest, because the longer the debate continues the more strongly do I see the justice of their case. I could understand a demand for a higher rate of interest if all the money with which these works were constructed were loan money. But we would also be paying 3 per cent, interest on money which has never existed. For instance, the sites of many of the post-offices in the various capitals and towns throughout Australia have never been out of the hands of the States. These greatly enhanced values will have to be paid for at the same rate of interest as loan money. I must confess that the States will have the best of this bargain, so far as the rate is concerned. </para>

            <para>- Exactly ; I knew that was what it was, but it has been thrashed out twice already. The honorable and learned senator will recognise that while we may have agreement in some cases, we must always, in dealing with these amendments, look to the breaking-point of the clause. And supposing there is no agreement, what is to be done ? If there is no agreement there must be a payment in cash, and that would mean that the Commonwealth would have to pay between ten and eleven millions of money. The honorable and learned senator must see that that is impossible, and I ask the committee not to agree to the amendment. </para>

          <para>- I again call attention to the desirability of putting some words into the paragraph to provide for the mode of payment. It should be provided in the Bill that the interest and principal should be paid to the States some time before they became due. If the matter is left to arrangement between the States and the Commonwealth it will simply mean that it will be the subject of almost interminable disputes. The interest upon the State loans has to be paid at certain dates, and the Commonwealth should provide the necessary amount of money a certain time before the due date for the payment of interest in order that it may be remitted to London. In the same way money required for the payment of the principal should be handed over to the States three months before the due dates for its payment. We must bear in mind that the Commonwealth does not take the responsibility of these debts so far as the debenture-holders are concerned. They will, of course, continue to look to the States. All that the Commonwealth has to do is to deal with the States, and I think it necessary we should provide that the States shall receive interest and principal three months beforehand in order that they may be able to remit the money to meet their obligations at home. </para>

There is no doubt it is an important detail, but the honorable senator will recognise that once we begin to supply details of these arrangements we will have to provide some general form of agreement in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- There is an objection to putting in those words ; in the first place, because the honorable senator will see, on looking at the paragraph, that there is absolutely no necessity for them ; and we would, by their insertion, be laying down a hard-and-fast rule, which might not be applicable in all cases. By the Commonwealth becoming responsible to the State in respect of a loan, it will follow that where the conditions of the loan involve a half-yearly payment of interest by the State, the Commonwealth will have to pay the interest half-yearly. </para>

            <para>- It will be confused with the plan which is really wanted. I am firmly of opinion that if the words were left out there would be no difficulty in seeing that a transfer was duly registered under the Real Property Act. Even although you have not got those words in the clause you can still effect your transfer ; but the presence of the words will create confusion between some plan to be certified under the hand of the Attorney-General and another plan. Why make the Attorney-General certify to a plan when under the State Act it cannot possibly be accepted ? </para>

        <para>Certified bv a surveyor authorized to make surveys under the different Land Transfer Acts." I take it, however, that under those Acts the State authorities will accept the survey of the Commonwealth surveyor, but that if they do not it is quite probable that by regulation they might be enabled to do so. I should be very sorry if I were to lose an opportunity of putting in this provision, and afterwards to find out that some State had to pass an Act of Parliament. I do not think, however, they would have to go that length. I do not know whether this provision is absolutely in the Act itself, but I fancy that the Governor in Council in any State would have authority to accept the survey of a Commonwealth officer. The Postmaster-General seemed to think that the State officials would be bound to regard as official what the Commonwealth surveyor did. </para>

But, so far as subsequent dispositions are concerned, as long as the description of the land proposed to be affected by the transfer, or whatever the instrument may be, is sufficient to render it identifiable on the plan in the office, no further subdivisional plan need accompany the instrument. If the description is sufficiently explicit to enable the officer to recognise the land upon the former plan the transfer can be registered. </para>

            <para>- If the description lodged with the Recorder of Titles indicated a portion of land belonging to the proprietor, who owned more land, the Recorder of Titles would alter the office plan accordingly, so that no subsequent attempt at disposal on the part of the owner could go any further than the counter of the Lands Titles-office. It would be found there that the original office plan had been altered, and that the land was not the property of the person purporting to deal with it, but the property of the Commonwealth. For these reasons I think the words may as well remain in the clause. </para>

            <para>- It isa symbolic number, and one can hardly understand the choice of the number six unless it is with the view to appointing an inspector either in, or in respect of each State constituting the Commonwealth. We are to have six inspectors, each of whom is to have £800 a year - £4,800. That is to say, we are to pay between £6,000 and £7,000 a year for these officers appointed for seven years, because the inspectors are to be appointed for the same period and practically under the same tenure as the commissioner. Then we are to have a permanent head for each department, who is supposed to be quite incapable of controlling his department, and requires to have over him first the inspector, then the commissioner, then the Minister without responsibility, and then the Parliament that can do nothing. </para>

            <para>- Possibly enough. Let us, too, cast some responsibility on the permanent head, and the chief officer in each State. If the chief officer of the department in a State is not to be trusted; if he is not competent to inspect his own department, and to say whether there are too many officers or too few, he ought to he dismissed, because he is not worthy of the position. We are giving them, I hope, handsome salaries. If he is not competent to do that, what is the permanent head for ? Is he simply to be an ornamental officer ? Is he never to examine into the management and progress of the department? Is he to sit in Melbourne while Parliament is sitting, and to migrate - with allowances, of course - to Sydney ? What has he to do for his money ? Surely we do not want a multiplicity of officers ? We are not to relieve these gentlemen of all their duty. The permanent head of a department ought to have thrown upon him the responsibility of controlling its officers, and he will have plenty of time to do a little inspection on his own account. But if you say that he is not familiar, or not likely to be familiar, with the working of the departments in the different States, then let the chief officer in each State do it. I do not deny for a moment that inspection is as useful in the public service as it is in the banks, but let us there, as in the bank, have an inspector appointed from the staff. Let the chief clerk in the State, if he wishes to send round an inspector as he ought to do, choose a man from the staff. </para>

            <para>- An inspection is a very good thing ; it keeps the officers in the different branches up to their duties. If we want an inspector to do that, let him be appointed in the State by the chief clerk as one of the staff, or let him be appointed generally, if you like, by the head of the department, to make these inspections. But why we should have six inspectors, even if that is merely put as the maximum, superadded to a commissioner, when we have the under-secretary and the chief officer familiar in every respect with the working of the department, and the performance of the duties by the clerks, I really cannot understand. We ought to be able to trust the permanent head, and the chief clerk. If we do not trust them, if circumstances arise to show that this country is so poor in the integrity of its public officers, that they are not to be trusted, we shall have to conceive and bring into operation a much more drastic remedy than is produced in the Bill. But I deny that that state of things has arisen or is ever likely to arise. And, moreover, when we come to see the high and responsible position which these gentlemen occupy, it does seem to be a reflection on them that we should require six others to be appointed with a view to doing exactly the same work as we should expect from them. Their familiarity with their own department is complete ; no inspector can acquire an equal familiarity, </para>

Looking at the position of the Commonwealth and the stage we have reached, this system of control is entirely unnecessary. It is imposing a cost on the Commonwealth which we can very well dispense with, and a cumbrous system such as this is is needless when we have the permanent head and chief clerk in each State to do the work, maintaining at the same time Ministerial responsibility to Parliament for any irregularities. Our present situation makes it all the more important that that responsibility shall be maintained in the keenest possible way. We are only beginning ; we are constructing a machine ; we are organizing our public service. For two years or more we should be in a position to lay our finger on any irregularities in building up the public service, and we shall not be able to do that, certainly not effectively, if this system is introduced and parliamentary responsibility is immediately swept away. </para>

            <para>- It is not my intention to deprecate the fullest possible discussion of this clause, but I hope it will be remembered that it contains the central principle of the Bill. It proposes a certain system of public service administration, and honorable senators who are not satisfied with that system should suggest a better system to adopt in its place. It must be admitted that various systems of public service control have been tried in the States. In many cases they have been tried and found wanting. What we desire at the commencement of our career is, if possible, with the help of the accumulated wisdom of honorable senators from all the States, to devise some system which will be the least open to objection. The system of what has been called Ministerial control has been a great deal spoken of. That has been adopted, I think, in nearly every State, and in many it has been found necessary or desirable to adopt a different system. I listened with great interest during the second-reading debate to the arguments against the Bill on that one point, and certainly they were arguments which appealed strongly to me, as they did to many others. It no doubt looks very well to say that the Minister is responsible to Parliament, and therefore he is the person upon whom should be cast the duty of making appointments, and of controlling the civil service in his department. We were also asked on several occasions to consider the case of a merchant in command of a large establishment. We are asked how he could conduct his operations if he had not the controlling voice in the appointment of the officers who were to work in the establishment under him. That certainly is a very effective argument. But the merchant would not be satisfied if he were stepping into a business with having only the power to make ' future appointments. He would want to go down to bedrock, and to have the power of appointing the whole of the persons who were going to work under him. </para>

If you adopt the principle that a Minister, being responsible to Parliament, should have the power of making all fresh appointments, you should go further and say that he should have power to substitute officers for those appointed by his predecessor, in which case you get to a system which is supposed to exist in America - I do not think it does - which is known as the system of " spoils to the victors." </para>

            <para>- I want to proceed by stages. The person who first of all makes a report to the commissioner with regard to an appointment, a transfer, or a promotion, is the permanent head. There is good reason, I think, for that provision. The Minister is administering foi- the time being, and probably he has some other occupation, and has not had the means of becoming acquainted with the officers in his department. The permanent head, on the other hand, is probably almost necessarily a man who has lived all his life in the public service. He has got no other background, and he has had every possible means of not only knowing the civil service generally, but of making the acquaintance of the officers under him. Looking the other way, the Minister has the prospect, after a term more or less short, of ceasing to administer the department. He may go into another department or pas3 out of politics, and cease to have .any intimate connexion with that department. The permanent head has no future before him except in that department. A man who has lived all his past life in the public service has probably nothing to look forward to except, perhaps, in his old age, to retire on a pension. His whole life is wrapped up in that department. He has the means of knowing the feelings and wishes of the officers in that department, and he has nothing in front of him except to live and work in such a way as to make his department a credit to the country, and be himself a credit to it. The permanent head, then, is the man who makes the report to the commissioner. </para>

            <para>- I can speak about the commissioner directly. I am pointing out that whereas under a system of Ministerial control the Minister would be the person who in the first place would recommend to the Governor-General in Council the appointment or promotion of an officer, under this system the first act towards the appointment or promotion of an officer is with the permanent head. I justify that on the ground that the permanent head from his past has a better means of knowing the conditions of the service and the value of different officers, and because looking forward to the future he can give the greatest- possible guarantee that he has no interest to serve except to promote the welfare of his department. </para>

            <para>- I am coming to the commissioner. It is just as well that honorable senators should spend a few minutes in ascertaining what the system proposed by the Bill is, so that if they do not agree with it they can give us an alternative system. The first principle is that it is the permanent head who makes the report to the commissioner. He has the advantage of having, in a big department like the Post-office, a chief officer in each of the States. He will have the advantage of the knowledge of the chief officer in making his report to the commissioner. Now we come to the commissioner. I presume he will not necessarily be in the civil service before his appointment, but he will be a man who has a considerable knowledge of the civil service and also of something beyond. I think he should be a man of affairs, with a general knowledge of the world, in order to satisfactorily discharge such functions as are intrusted to him. </para>

          <para>- I have experienced a feeling of irritation, and I may add of humiliation, at having to consider a Bill of this sort. I have devoted many hours to the study of it. I have made many and various inquiries as to the working of the various civil service systems in the different States, and the more I proceed the more my irritation and sense of humiliation increases. I should like to devote a few minutes to the consideration of the reasons which have induced the Government to bring forward this Bill, to the history as far as we can get at it of measures of a similar character in the various States, and thirdly, to the principle embodied in clause 5, which is the foundation of the whole Bill. As I understand, the reason which has prompted the Government in bringing forward this Bill is that certain Cabinets - certain State Cabinets, if honorable senators prefer to put it that way - have in the past proved themselves so weak in the back, so amenable to the wire-pulling of electors through Members of Parliament, that they have not had the courage or the firmness to administer the civil service under their control with ordinary justice or common fair play between man and man. </para>

            <para>- We find that in Victoria the system that has obtained has been that if there was a vacancy in one department - say the Post-office - and there was a man in the Customs who had a little more seniority than another man in the Post-office, the officer from the Customs would be transferred to the Post-office. This system was followed by the Victorian Public Service Board to such an extent that it got the whole service into a state of muddle. Victoria had to retrace her steps, and when there was a vacancy in one department they had to adopt the system of moving on the next man in the department. What is the use of taking a man who has been sorting letters in the Post-office and putting him into the Customs department, where he will have to do with invoices and the passing of entries? The work is entirely different, and I do not see anything to be gained by jumping men about from department to department. </para>

            <para>- Is it the idea that if this Bill is passed the Government are going to break down the barriers between the States ? Whenever there is a vacancy in the Post-office in Melbourne, we will say, are they going to look around the different States for a man who may have three months' seniority over an eligible man in a Melbourne office? Are they going to take a man from Tasmania, Western Australia, or Queensland ? If they are going to deal with the public service in that way they will certainly want a commissioner and half-a-dozen inspectors. But is that the proper way of dealing with the public service ? I think we should wait a few years in order to see how matters work out, and then frame a Bill which will suit the needs of the Commonwealth. At present we are all intensely ignorant as to how thinks are going to work. If I were Minister I should deprecate the idea of officers being brought from one State to another in the way proposed. Do not let us change cabins until we have launched the ship and have a fair wind behind her. A wrong would be done in appointing officers out of their own States at present. </para>

            <para>- Because if there is a vacancy in the Post-office or in the Customs department to-morrow the next man in the office under present arrangements will get the appointment; or if there is a man below him whose merit entitles him to the billet he may be appointed to it over the head of a man who may have one or two black marks against him through laziness or negligence. Matters of that kind can be settled by the head of the department and the Minister in a few moments. We are invited to accept this Bill as an experiment. I believe that if honorable senators will read and inform themselves as to what has taken place in reference to the measure they will see that it is simply as an experiment that it is offered to us. My opinion is that we should not make the experiment now, but should Lay the Bill on one side for the present, and then, when we see how the departments are working, and what our requirements are, and what sort of a civil service ours is going to be, let us frame a measure which will be suitable to our needs. Before I leave the case of Victoria, let me observe that on every side to-day, I see dissatisfaction in connexion with the service of this State. I commenced to look into this matter carefully two or three weeks ago, and since then two or three times a week I have seen paragraphs in the journals which lead me to suppose that there is more dissatisfaction existing now in the civil service of Victoria than exists in any other State in Australia, where I believe we have not the same amount of wire pulling. What do I find ? I find that the teachers of Victoria in the State schools are all dissatisfied with their classification. I look at the Victorian Act, and I find that it is not the Civil Service Board who classify the teachers, but that it is the inspectors of the schools, the men who know the work of the teachers and have been inspecting their pupils and their work for years, who classify them. But it appears that everybody in the civil service and everybody else in this State is in such a state of mind that they are all dissatisfied. Although these teachers are classified and graded by the very men who have to inspect their work daily and hourly, they are as much dissatisfied there as anywhere else. I made some inquiries in connexion with the Railway department, and I am told that scandals have arisen there, that Ministers in the Victorian Parliament have sat up night after night, and had injustices pointed out as having being done to officers of that department by commissioners of railways, and they have been powerless to alter the state of things. I find that at the present moment certain civil servants are expecting that the Premier of Victoria is going to look into their cases, that a lot of men are going to have the right to appeal to him ; and in another corner of the paper I see that a man is actually asking for a mandamus to compel the commissioners to classify him differently. The whole thing is so cumbrous that it is difficult for the commissioners themselves to say what their powers are. At all events under this Victorian Act there is an appeal to the law courts in order to settle how clerks in a department are to be graded, managed and promoted. That is not responsible government. If we get back to responsible government, as I hope we shall do, for goodness' sake let the Ministers have the responsibility of administering their departments. Let me say at once that I regard any Member of Parliament who listens to the complaint of a civil servant as doing wrong. The civil servant is absolutely breaking the regulations under which he is earning his salary, and the Member of Parliament who sees a Minister in reference to a civil servant's complaint is unintentionally doing what I consider a gross wrong. When the head of a department advises the Minister that a certain civil servant ought to be fined, or ought to be transferred, there is a judicial act performed. The head of the department recommends that a man should be fined, because he thinks he ought justly to be fined; he says that he shall be sent to a certain place, because he thinks he is the right man to go ; and for any Member of Parliament to listen to the civil servant's complaint, and then go to the Minister with it, behind the back of the head of the department, is to my mind a gravely improper thing to do. That it is done so often may be said to be an excuse why any honorable senator may do the same thing to-morrow, but it is still absolutely improper and absolutely wrong. When the head of a department and the Minister say that a certain thing shall be done in the filling up of a vacancy, the increase of a salary, or the fining of a civil servant, there is a judicial act performed, and we might just as well go to a Judge of a court, and try to influence his decision, as go to a Minister and ask him to undo what the head of the department has done, and alter the verdict given in favour of or against the civil servant. That is the way I regard it, and I cannot regard it in any other way. If we could say that we can rely upon civil servants carrying out the written regulations under which they are working, and not going to Members of Parliament ; if we could rely on Members of Parliament declining to be interviewed by civil servants; and if we could rely upon the Minister declining to have any interview with a Member of Parliament upon such matters, the thing would be done, and ve would not need any Bill of this kind at all. </para>

            <para>- I know it has been done recently, and I may say that two very nice-looking young ladies interviewed me at four o'clock this afternoon. They could not see another senator, and that is why they sent for me. I told them they were breaking the rules of the civil service, but they said no, that they had inquired about that, and there were coming on behalf of a class - the ladies' class. They did manage to get in a few words for themselves. These ladies have served twelve and thirteen years respectively in a certain department. and they are getting £84 a year. They told me of One poor old lady, aged 61, whom I did not see, and she also was getting £84 a year, and this Bill provides that a girl of 16, who enters the department to-morrow, shall, when she is 21 years of age, get a minimum salary of £110 per year. Here there are women who have been half a lifetime in the employment of the State, and they are now getting £84 per year, and in some cases less, and it is unjus't that almost immediately the minimum wage of a girl who may be living in her mother'shouse should now be fixed at £110 a year. </para>

If the Governor-General does not approve of any proposal, it is to be the duty of the commissioner, without any assistance from, or any knowledge on the part of, the permanent head, to reconsider the proposal and submit another, which will be considered and dealt with by the Governor-General. The inspectors have to examine every department, classify every officer, and estimate the value of his services, and the commissioner has to recommend the disposition of offices and the grading of officers to the Governor-General, who finally deals with the matter.

            <para>- That is so, as the honorable and learned senator has said. Sub-clause (2) of clause 12, honorable senators will see, makes the permanent head responsible for the general working of all the business of his department, and it absolutely conflicts and is inconsistent with half-a-dozen other most important clauses. He is to be responsible for the proper working of his department, while a man above him can remove, control, get rid of, classify, grade, and fix the salaries of the officers of his department. </para>

            <para>- Clause 16 says that the administrative division shall include all the permanent heads of departments and all chief officers of departments, and also all persons whose offices the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the commissioner, directs to be included in such divisions. There is nothing there about the permanent head either, so that the whole administrative department is to consist of senior officers and persons recommended by the commissioner to the Governor-General, and the permanent head has no say in it. There is provision for a similar recommendation by the commissioner in the constitution of the professional division. I do not know whether the permanent head should have a say in the constitution of the professional division, but I do not see why he should not, and he will know as much about it as the commissioner. Then it is provided that the clerical division shall include all officers whose offices the Governor-General, on the recommendation of the commissioner, directs to be included, so that the whole clerical division may be framed and the officers named, and the permanent head has no voice in the matter in any way whatever. I have already referred to clause 20 dealing with the fixing of salaries. There is one officer in the State of Victoria who has been 39 years in the service, and yet a commissioner, who has yet to be appointed, is to recommend to the Governor-General what salary each officer is to get. Is it not a farce ? How can we possibly hope to have a service honestly and firmly regulated if we ignore the permanent head in that way ? Under sub-clause (3) of clause 21 it is provided - </para>

If we adopt the remaining portion of the Bill, and make the permanent head responsible to the Minister, and the Minister in his turn responsible to Parliament, we shall have an efficient method of managing and controlling public servants. We have to exercise great care in framing this legislation. The States have had similar legislation - in some cases, perhaps not quite so stringent, and not giving the commissioner quite so much power, but in other cases giving more power. It is stated in the press that the public service of Victoria is seething with discontent. Yet in this State I believe a similar law is in force. </para>

The first commissioner is to be appointed for seven years, and, if at the end of that term it is found necessary to change the commissioner, according to that argument a new man ought to have the right to say - " I am dissatisfied with the appointments made by my predecessor, and I want power to appoint a new set of officers." The same argument could be applied to both cases. I do not see that it- is. any argument against Ministerial control. </para>

            <para>- Still we know that he has the power under sub-clause (6) of clause 8, to retire officers if he thinks that their services are unnecessary. The Bill certainly gives one the impression that the Ministry have no confidence in their own ability. Considering that it contains the leading administrators in the States for years past- some of the most able administrators, I may say - it certainly shows a want of confidence in themselves that they ask to be allowed to shift their own responsibility on to the shoulders of a commissioner and six inspectors. A commissioner must be a resident of some State, possibly a man who has been associated with either its public life or its civil service. He would be acquainted with the public officers of the State, and he would naturally favour the officers of that State. And, where the recommendation of an inspector clashes with the recommendation of a permanent head, I can quite understand the commissioner allowing his bias to decide the appointment, perhaps in a way which would be prejudicial to the interests of the Commonwealth. The commissioner must necessarily reside a large portion of his time at the seat of government. Therefore he will be under the influence of the press as well as the social influence of that particular quarter. That, I believe, will be a far more dangerous influence to be exercised on the public service than any political influence I could imagine. </para>

            <para>- He has the power under some clauses, if necessary, to make appointments without examination. For the Governor-General may, on the recommendation of the commissioner if he sees fit, set aside the provisions as to examinations. He may make special appointments. Under that system I contend he could allow social influence to override the justice of the appointment. In several States they have had an experience of railway commissioners. Under the various Acts the commissioners, when appointed, were given almost unlimited power. In what way did they use it? In some of the States the Acts have been amended or repealed, and the commissioners have been shorn of original powers. </para>

            <para>- Not with anything approaching the powers which they used to exercise. While these Acts were designed to remove the railways from political control, from the influence of men with large wealth or social standing, in the debate on the Bills to repeal the Acts it was proved up to the hilt in numberless cases that those very men were just as open to another class of influence as ever Parliament was. Wherever political influence is used you have this safeguard, that the electors can bring to book at an election those who are responsible for misusing that influence. But where you have an inspector appointed for a term of years he is practically independent of Parliament. There has to be some very grave scandal indeed before you can get both Houses of Parliament to pass a resolution to remove a commissioner. We are told that a seven years' term of office will remove a public service commissioner from the influence of the Ministers, and that, therefore, he will not be their tool. But what will be his position near the close of his term of office ? He will be a very pliable officer in the hands of any Ministry, seeing that he has to look to them for his reappointment. I can imagine that he will practically do anything which is required of him by the Ministry. </para>

          <para>- In criticising the provisions of this measure, I hope it will not be understood that I am opposed to passing a Civil Service Bill, or to the proper control of the civil service, or to any system by which it can be assured to civil servants that justice will be done to them. But it does seem to me that in bringing in a Bill of this kind the Ministry are proceeding upon a principle which we who believe in the theory of representative government should be slow to assent to. The object of the introduction of this measure is undoubtedly in order that the appointment of civil servants may be freed from the influences that have so often been brought to bear upon persons appointed. But does the Government for a moment mean to say that merely because the officer who appoints is called a commissioner instead of a Minister, he is necessarily further above Suspicion than a Minister would be ? Can we, by altering the name of the person, bring about a revolution which will assure to persons seeking appointments that justice will be done to them ? I believe that when we look at this matter and consider the step we are taking, it will be found that we are entering upon very debatable grounds. The Minister who appointed under the old system is responsible to Parliament. What have we so long been striving for ? We have been striving for representative government - for the government of the people by Ministers responsible directly to Parliament and to the people. But under this Bill we are asked to hand over our affairs to persons, absolutely above the heads of Parliament for the time they are appointed, unless what it is practically impossible to prove can be proved against them. We are going to take away from the representatives of the people the control over the people's affairs and hand them over to persons holding office for a fixed term, and who within reasonable limits can do what they choose during the time of their appointment. It does seem to me that this is not at all consistent with the views that we have lately been developing in. Australia. We have been crying out time after time for the control of this country by the people who live in the country. We have been crying out against autocracy and against government by irresponsible persons - persons whom the people cannot bring to book. What is proposed to be done here is to hand over to a gentleman appointed for a term of seven years the practical control of our civil service. </para>

            <para>- No doubt with a great number of safeguards. But what greater safeguard and protection can the civil servants have than public opinion ? Where is there a greater safeguard provided by this Bill than the lash that Parliament can lay upon the Minister where he does wrong? Where can you possibly get a greater protection to the public of this country than making Ministers directly responsible to Parliament for their policy? No doubt there are safeguards ; but the Government are going to part with the safeguards that exist at the present time by handing enormous powers over to a commissioner who will be morally superior to the Minister for the time being. One of the greatest safeguards the public can have is that a Ministry can be turned out of office if it does wrong, whereas, under this Bill, if actual corruption cannot be proved against the commissioner, Parliament itself is absolutely powerless to interfere with his actions. I quite agree that the members of the civil service are entitled to something ; but I believe that the utmost that a Civil Service Bill, as introduced in the early stages of this Parliament, should do, is to provide machinery to enable a civil servant to whom wrong is done to have his case tried in a proper way. This much, I think, is done by the Act of Western Australia. It is an extremely short and simple Act. It provides, amongst other things, that where a civil servant is suspended, or has any ground of complaint, or is dismissed by the Minister, he can demand the grounds of his dismissal or his suspension. The action of the Minister is therefore brought directly under the notice of Parliament, together with the reasons given by the Minister for his action, and Parliament becomes directly the arbiter as to the propriety of the Minister's action. </para>

            <para>- Machinery is provided in the Act to give the man who is aggrieved an inquiry before the board. The action of the Minister is thereupon either upheld or condemned. Any Member of Parliament can take steps, if necessary, in extreme cases to challenge the action of the Minister. In case the board recommends the reinstatement of the officer, there are very few Ministers who would refuse to comply with it. If the board held that a man was wrongfully dismissed, and the Minister would not reinstate him, the matter would come before Parliament, which would in all probability order that he should be reinstated. </para>

            <para>- The main object we wish to achieve is to insure that injustice is not done to the civil servants. As to the reference made to the condition of the civil service in America, I would point out that there is no parallel at all. In America the Minister is absolutely above Parliament. Parliament cannot turn a Ministry out. The President and his Ministers remain in office during the term of the President's appointment. Parliament may refuse to grant supplies or to pass legislation; but it cannot deal with the Minister as we can deal with him. Therefore, the conditions in America and Australia are entirely different. Parliament, in this country, has to see that Ministers carry on their departments satisfactorily, and, in my opinion, with that object in view, the department is best left in the Minister's hands. </para>
