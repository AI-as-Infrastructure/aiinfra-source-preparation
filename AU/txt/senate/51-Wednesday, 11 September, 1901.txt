                    <para>. - This and the following four clauses introduce machinery for the purpose of making it compulsory on the Government to take samples of all teas, to submit them to a Government analyst, and to deal with them accordingly after certain notice is given. A good deal of that machinery was unnecessary, because it existed in the Bill as drawn, while another part of it was new. I have drafted some amendments which do not affect the meaning of the clauses in any way, but bring them into conformity with the general scope of the Bill.

                    <para>- I do not consent to this amendment, because it seems to me it would be a very arbitrary way of limiting the liability. There may be cases in which the liability ought to extend beyond seven days. As the honorable senator is aware, the bill of lading settles the right of the owners of the goods and the master of the ship in regard to the landing of the goods, subject always to the laws of the port. The only cases in which clause 71 could be applied at all are. cases in which, for some reason or another, the entry has not been passed for goods. The ship-master may want to get the whole of his cargo out. He does not wait until entries are passed, but puts all the goods out and leaves the entries to be passed afterwards. </para>

                        <para>- The voyage is over, but I may suggest that where goods are sought to be landed under a collector's permit, where the owner of the goods has not taken delivery himself, the master has two alternatives, and may accept whichever suits him best. He may land the goods under the permit, and doing so will not alter his relations with the owner of the goods, or he may as an alternative carry them on further if he chooses. This clause merely means that the legal relations existing between him and the owners of the goods shall not be affected by the fact of his having decided to land the goods under the permit. If he puts them into the bonded warehouse he is the man who is responsible for them. </para>

                        <para>- The ship-owner would not take them on board under such circumstances. The collector's permit is given as a rule not to enable the discharge of a package or parcel of damaged goods, but generally to enable the whole cargo to be discharged. It may be the case of a mail steamer which may have to hurry on to complete her contract, and the collector may say - "Yes, you may land your cargo and proceed on with your mail business." The clause then says very properly that the goods having been landed for the convenience of the ship, shall not be at the risk of the owners ; but surely we do not want to create a liability that the bill of lading does not throw upon the owners of the goods, and say that he shall be liable for damages or risk by fire or any other risk that may accrue month after month. I am quite certain that if honorable senators grasped the point they would see the fairness of the amendment I propose to make. </para>

                        <para>- Goods on which there is no liability to Customs duty are also covered by the clause. A ship gets a permit from the Customs to land goods on which there is no duty, and once free goods are landed they pass the Customs and there is no liability at all to the department. The liability is simply one to the warehouse. I hold that there ought to be no liability placed on the holders of goods by the Crown for any expenses in which it is not interested. </para>

                        <para>- In looking through clauses 122, 123, and 124, dealing with ships' stores, it appeared to me that they might be amended verbally, so as to bring out unmistakably the intention of the committee. I have had some amendments drafted which will put the provisions in such absolute language that there can be no mistake as to what our meaning is, and what the rights of parties are. It is very desirable that this should be done, because my wish is to see the Bill leave the Senate in such a form that our amendments may be accepted exactly as they are. I propose to alter the order of the clauses. Clause 1 23, after it is amended, will become clause 122. The only difference, besides the position of the clause, is that it is made perfectly clear that the expression " ships' stores " refers not only to the stores shipped in any particular State, but also to stores which are brought out here in the ship. Clause 124, which will become clause 123, applies only to the unshipping of free stores, and I propose to make it apply to ships' stores generally. In the clause, which is now clause 122, I propose to deal with the allowance of free stores. It seems to me that logically it ought to come after the clause dealing with stores to be used on payment of duty. The clauses, as redrafted and transposed, do nothing more than carry out the intention of the committee. </para>

                        <para>- It is not impossible, so far as my experience of the Customs goes in South Australia. I have had cases where, when there were disputes, I have had the importer and the Customs officer before me and cross-examined them ; and I found that my own officers thoroughly understood the value of the goods, and that their estimates accorded with the value placed upon the goods by experts whom I called in. I see just as much danger of fraud from taking an invoice supplied by an agent in London as from taking an invoice issued by a manufacturer on the Continent. </para>

                    <para>. - The object of the Government and the Customs authorities is not, I take it, to get the highest amount possible, but to get the true amount of duty. The honorable senator's argument, therefore, entirely falls to the ground, that is, that we should be glad to accept the invoice from the firm in London, which I would call the invoice of the last seller, simply because as a rule the value of the goods given in that invoice would be higher. What we want to get at is the true value of the goods, and the Bill lays down a certain basis for ascertaining it. </para>

                        <para>- It is all very well to say in that light and airy manner that we could easily find out the value here, but in practice I believe we would find great difficulty in ascertaining it. The basis of valuation laid down in the Bill is, I believe the basis of valuation accepted in nearly every country - the fair value of the article in the markets of the country from which it was exported. That is to say, the country of origin. I think there would not have been nearly so much confusion introduced into the discussion of this subject if that term had been used in the first place. The difficulty in using the term " whence the goods are exported " is that they may be exported from a number of countries in succession. In the same way there may be a number of successive sellers of those goods. They may be sold from one country and shipped to another, then sold by a merchant in that country, and then shipped to some other country. What is clearly intended by the Bill, is that in order to ascertain the true value of the goods we go first of all to the country from which they have been exported, and ascertain their fair market value in that country, and there is an addition made afterwards of 10 percent. </para>

                    <para>- The amendment which I propose to make in this clause is of considerable importance. The Bill, as drawn, gives power to compulsorily acquire property - not only against an individual, but against a State. While it is quite right either for a State or for the Commonwealth to have power to acquire property compulsorily against a private individual, it is altogether a different thing for the Commonwealth to have power under all circumstances to compulsorily acquire property against any State. I would ask honorable senators to bear in mind that in Australia - more perhaps than in any country of the world - there is a tendency for the State to take hold of business matters. Therefore the question of the acquisition of property in Australia is a more serious matter than it would be in a country like the United States. I direct the attention of the committee, first of all, to the Constitution Act, which, in section 51, sub-section xxxiii., gives power for - </para>

                    <para>I am not at all satisfied that it would be advisable to insert this new sub-section. It comes on us somewhat as a surprise, and I would like to have further time to consider the effect of it. It might enable the Commonwealth to run the States into enormous expenditure. The leader of the Convention will see that whatever property has to be acquired will probably be acquired out of State's money. If we increase these powers of purchasing property, we may enable the Commonwealth to incur enormous expenditure. I think it is shown by some notes I have with regard to Canada and other places, that that has really been the result of a power of this kind. If it were so here the States' Treasuries would be the sufferers. </para>

                        <para>- Well, I believe it is necessary. Under this very Bill there are certain matters referred to the High Court, and I am therefore following a very good and, I believe, a very necessary example. I am quite confident that the majority of the people of the States will not be satisfied to have this power of compulsory acquisition without some restriction. I have mentioned various matters in connexion with which land or property may be compulsorily acquired, but there are various others. There is the High Court of Judicature itself. There is the power taken also in connexion with statistics, with bankruptcy, patents, copyrights, immigration, conciliation and arbitration, the whole of which throughout the Commonwealth will require very considerable office accommodation, and when we further take into consideration the accommodation required in connexion with the Customs, the Post-office department, light-houses and defence, we find that the power of acquisition on the part of the Commonwealth is a very wide one, and may become very serious indeed. I therefore ask the committee to very seriously consider the matter which I now respectfully and earnestly put before them. </para>

                    <para>- The proposition of the honorable senator seems to me a most extraordinary one to submit to the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The honorable senator seems to be struggling against the power which the Constitution has given to us to make laws for the acquisition of property. In the first place, I think that every one must admit that it is impossible to Conceive the possibility of any Commonwealth constituted as ours is, being able to carry on its business, unless it has some power to compulsorily acquire the land upon which it is to carry out its administration. Otherwise, inasmuch as its operations have to be carried on upon some property, and that property is the property of the States in which each of the places where the operations are carried on are situated ; if there was not this power of compulsory acquisition, the Commonwealth Government would be handed over to any speculator, or any person who wished to squeeze out an enormous sum of money for his land. </para>

                    <para>- This is one of the amendments which I suggested. I did so because I have had a considerable amount of practice in acquiring land for public purposes in Tasmania, and I know that it is absolutely necessary that the land-owner should be served with a copy of the plan of the land which the undertakers propose to acquire. Under the Torrens Act, which is the present mode of transferring land, the transfer is done not by a description, but by a plan. In Tasmania no plan would be received by the Transfer office unless certified to as correct by a surveyor authorized to make surveys under the Real Property Act. Would it not be well to put in the words - </para>

Clause 59 deals with the lodging of the notification which is to have the effect of conveying the title. I do not think it can appropriately be dealt with here. This clause only deals with the serving of the notification. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I do not think there can be any doubt that this is a provision which will be very largely availed of, because all the States are, no doubt, in the position of having loans they would like to get rid of, and, according to the proposal I put before the committee, it does not matter what the currency of the loan is, or what the interest on the loan is. We fix the basis at 3 per cent., and we can determine by a mere matter of actuarial tables how much of a particular loan we have got to take over, in order to equal the amount of compensation to be paid. There is another plan which is a fourth alternative, but as I have not been able yet to place it in print before honorable senators, I shall not refer to it now. In the meantime we may just as well discuss the proposals which are now before the committee, and if the other proposal should not arrive in time, the discussion upon it may be postponed until to-morrow. </para>

If the Minister will "kindly point out in what part of the Bill the matter is dealt with I shall be satisfied at once. With regard to the settlement of the matter of compensation on a 3 per cent, basis, think it is a fair one. The States are paying more than 3 per cent, on some of their loans. The money which should be paid to the States as compensation will not be based on the amount which they have expended, but on the value of the property taken over. I move - </para>

                        <para>- I know; but to give the Commonwealth the option of paying in four different ways - either in cash or in one of the other three different ways proposed - is to take over property in a manner that is not just, because it gives the Commonwealth all the advantage and places the States at a disadvantage. I only speak from such experience as I have had as a lawyer and a man of business, and I say distinctly that any lawyer who has had transactions in letting or selling land must know that any man who has an option has an advantage. If the market is still and steady, and is not fluctuating, the advantage perhaps is worth nothing ; but it is a great advantage when the market in property begins to rise. The only way we have a right to acquire property is on terms that are just. </para>

                        <para>- I think I have the right to point out the matter again. Suppose, in the instance I have already given, neither the State of South Australia nor the Commonwealth Treasurer will give way. Suppose the South Australian Treasurer says "I will not accept debentures, and intend to have sovereigns," and that the South Australian Government goes to the High Court and argues that under the Constitution when property is taken from a State it must be taken on terms that are just. I take it that if we force an option of this kind down the throat of the South Australian Government the Federal High Court will say that those terms are not just. </para>

                        <para>- The only reason I would at all favour this is that it might at times happen that the Commonwealth would not be able to pay in cash, and it is, therefore, desirable to provide a loop-hole out of such a difficulty. The most reasonable proposition in that direction is certainly that contained in the Bill as it stands, because the Bill as it stands says we must take an equivalent amount of the public debt of the State ; that is an -amount of the State debt at the time we make the arrangement, which will be equivalent to the money for which we are going to substitute it, and it is not bound fast by a rate of interest which might be reasonable to-day and unreasonable tomorrow. The 3 per cent, of to-day might be most unreasonable to-morrow, and therefore I prefer that the committee should leave the question as it is dealt with in the clause as already passed by the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree with the honorable and learned senator, and I am glad to hear that expression of opinion because I am entirely opposed to the new paragraph (b) ; but there my opposition stops, and I hope the committee will adopt the amendment in new paragraph (c), and reject the one marked (b). We shall then be doing no act of injustice to any of the States, and we shall be properly considering in advance some of the requirements of the Commonwealth, which it is our duty to consider, as well as the requirements of the different States. </para>

                <para>That is not a fair price ; that is not an indemnity. It is not only unjust, but it is illegal ; it is against the very spirit of the Constitution Act. I sincerely hope that the committee will agree to the clause precisely in its present form. </para>

At the present time the States have large expenditures from revenue or loan account, invested in what are practically dead assets, which do not bring in a cent of rent, and which the Commonwealth proposes to take over. </para>

Whatever rate is paid by the Commonwealth -will be paid for a term of 47 years, and that will be a clear gain to the States. They will be receiving cash to the amount of 3 or 31/2 per cent., and to that extent undoubtedly the States will be in a much better position. They are turning dead assets into liquid assets, which will bring in a certain sum to the revenue. </para>

                        <para>- But in doing justice we must be very careful not to cripple ourselves at the outset. Something has been said as to the understanding arrived at at the time of the Federation. The understanding was that which is contained in the Constitution itself. That understanding on the one hand gave the Commonwealth power to acquire land on just terms from any State, and it also forced upon us the necessity of taking over a very large amount of property from the States - and that not under the provisions of any Act which we may pass, but under the provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution itself. By section 85 of the Constitution we are compelled to give compensation for the property we take over. This same Constitution has given us a means of revenue to begin with - the Customs duties collected - but at the same time it has imposed upon us the limitation of the Braddon Clause ; and we have to remember, in considering the payments- we are to make on account of the expenditure of the Commonwealth, that it is impossible for us to expend more than a quarter of the net revenue which comes to us from the Customs. We have also to undertake the obligation of paying the different expenses incurred upon the transferred services. Therefore, we have to take the whole Constitution as the basis upon which we are to do justice to the States in regard to property taken over. </para>

                        <para>- I know ; but we do not want to spend it all in interest. We have many other things to spend it upon. It seems to me that the only thing in the mind of some honorable senators is that we have simply to be careful to give the States everything they want, and to see that they do not suffer any inconvenience. But on the other hand we have to see that this Constitution is worked out in accordance with its spirit, and to make our payments to the States, and our arrangements to pay them, on such terms as will not cripple the Commonwealth at its outset. With regard to the details of the property token over they are as follow : -From New South Wales the property taken over will amount in value to £3,200,000 ; from Victoria, £2,745,000 ; from Queensland, £1,590,000 ; from South Australia, £1,665,000; from Tasmania, £436,000, and from Western Australia £809,000. How will that be met? Of course it is out of the question, as every one sees, that payments for those properties should be made in cash. The mere statement of those figures ought to satisfy my honorable friends who have been clamouring that there is only one way in which the property is to bo paid for - namely, in cash, unless the Commonwealth and the States concerned can agree to another mode of payment - that it would be absurd to put the Commonwealth in the position of having to pay cash. </para>

                        <para>-- there is no apportionment of a loan to the particular work to be done. In all the States except that one there is a borrowing on the general credit of the State itself . Although there may be loans of different amounts, different currencies, and different rates of interest, the borrowing is upon the general strength of the credit of the State. Therefore I do not see that there is any way in which we can apportion the particular loan to the work to which it has been applied. </para>

                    <para>I may say that it was entirely owing to an inadvertence, for which no one is to blame, that the debate on the second reading of the Public Service Bill closed before some honorable senators had been afforded an opportunity of speaking upon the very important principles of the measure. The Government is very averse indeed to any honorable senator being deprived of his right of discussing the real principles of the Bill. The discussion of the principle will really centre round clause 5 and several other clauses in the some part of the measure. I desire to state now that the Government will not only not deprecate, but invite the fullest possible discussion on that portion of the measure, so that any honorable senator who has not had an opportunity of discussing it on the second reading will be able to do so in committee. </para>
