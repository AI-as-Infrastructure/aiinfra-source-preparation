                        <para>- Exactly. Under the New South Wales standing orders the business-paper is called over each day, so that honorable members may place their business, and it is a convenient system. I desire, if I can, to postpone this order of the day, and I shall be glad if you can direct me. </para>

                        <para>- I perceive the point raised by the honorable senator, but at present I do not exactly see how it can be met. Perhaps we may meet it under the new standing orders. If the honorable senator is not here at the time it is called on, any other senator can move that it be postponed and made an order of the day for some other day. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot allow this motion to go without a final word of protest. Recognising that the Senate has agreed to the adoption of clause 45, I do not think that it would be consonant with its wishes or with my position here to make any lengthy speech in opposition to the will of the majority. Nevertheless, I believe I am justified - indeed I am simply discharging my duty - in adding a word of final protest before the Bill leaves the Chamber, and for this reason : From first to last, until the clause made its appearance, the States were given to understand, and it was generally, I might say universally, understood, that in taking over the properties referred to the Commonwealth would compensate, to use the phrase of the Constitution Act, the States. We now find that under clause 45 of this Bill, a method has been introduced winch proposes to deal with capital in the same manner as revenue and annual expenditure are dealt with in the Constitution Act, and that by this means the States are to lose their property. The property is to be taken over by the Commonwealth, and they are neither to be compensated, as provided by the Constitution Act, nor are they to be relieved of the liabilities under which they lie to the public creditor for moneys borrowed in respect of the properties by the States themselves. Under these circumstances, and believing that the clause will give universal dissatisfaction ; that it will be esteemed, at least in the State from which I come, as a great breach of the understanding under which it entered into the Commonwealth compact, I feel it my duty to say these few words in final protest, and to divide the Senate on the third reading. I feel so strongly on the matter, that I have communicated with the Premier of New South Wales and with the principal newspapers in the capital of that State, because I conceive that it will create a feeling of an exceedingly strong if not a violent character. </para>

                        <para>- It will be seen that there is a general licence, authorizing the licensee to distil spirits from any material ; then there is a wine distiller's licence, authorizing the distillation of spirits from, wine or lees of wine. In those two cases the general business of the distiller will be carried on, and it is therefore right as an ordinary matter of business that a considerable fee should be charged. These distilleries will be carried on under the inspection of officers provided for in a later part of the Bill. The vignerons' licences are altogether different, as under them the licensee is entitled to distil spirits only from wine or lees of wine, and only for the purpose of fortifying wine. He will not be able to carry on a distillery business in the ordinary way. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator will see that the clause refers to licences in force under the existing Act. Those licences will be granted under certain conditions, as to premises, buildings, improvements, and so on, and where it appears to the collector that the conditions prescribed in the Bill with respect to premises should be carried out, the clause fixes the time within which the distiller must comply with them at not less than three months. The collector will not interfere unless something happens which makes it necessary in his opinion that the provisions should be carried out. On reflection I think that the honorable and learned senator will not find any reason to object to the clause. I may say at once that if there is any serious objection to any of these clauses before the Bill finally gets out of the committee stage I shall not raise any objection to a recommittal. </para>

Everything must have a beginning, and the limit provided here seems to be a little high. I do not, however, profess to have any expert knowledge on the point. </para>

                    <para>- The reason for the limitation may be readily explained. This clause deals with the issue of licences to distil spirits from wine for the purpose of fortifying wine. Such distillation must be under the inspection of a Customs officer, and it would be unreasonable to say that inspection shall be provided in the case of every vineyard. </para>

                    <para>- I have made some inquiries and have been informed that it is inadvisable to encourage the licensing of small stills ; that the existence of small stills opens the door to very grave frauds on the Customs. I am further informed that, as a matter of fact, a vigneron with less than 30 acres could not afford to distil legally, although of course he could afford to do it illegally. It would pay such a man better to turn his grapes into wine, or sell them rather than pay the fee for a vigneron's licence, and incur the other expenses connected with distillation. This is a matter which affects the Customs. I do not profess to be an expert, but I have had the advantage of conversing with one of the largest experts in South Australia, and it is from him that I have gained this information. Representatives of the vigneron interest in Victoria support that view. A circular in regard to the use of grape spirit has been issued by a conference, and I have discussed the matter with the secretary and another leading man in the movement, who waited upon me. They unhesitatingly condemn the use of small stills. They say it will not affect them, but that it will undoubtedly affect the Customs. The same point cropped up in Victoria some years ago, and the issue of licences for small stills resulted in great fraud. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment. I stated when moving the second reading of the Bill that it is not intended that six inspectors shall be appointed. This is only a limit fixed in the Bill. Possibly, during the early years of the Commonwealth, it may be sufficient to appoint three, in order to get the work done, but it is desirable that there should be power in the Bill to increase the number if necessary. It is unwise to have to come to Parliament from time to time to amend a Bill of this description. Certainly in the long run it will be necessary to have six inspectors to carry out the duties required of them. There will not necessarily be one for each State ; but probably it will be found necessary ultimately to have one inspector for each State. Six, therefore, seems to be a convenient number, and as it is a maximum the committee might adopt it. </para>

                        <para>- Certain honorable senators seem to think that some heads of departments have arrived at such a stage of efficiency that they require no supervision. It is in regard to some of these very officers, however, that the supervision of inspectors is necessary, in order to see that they do their duty thoroughly. The claims of persons who have been located for years in the northern parts of Queensland and other places will also receive some consideration if inspectors are appointed. </para>

                        <para>- We might have an incompetent inspector or an incompetent commissioner, but still that would not affect the system ; that is a matter of administration. I suggest that the present system is better than one which will create the inspector stationed in Western Australia the commissioner, while the commissioner himself will be simply a conduit-pipe through which the inspector's opinion is put into effect. It would be just as reasonable to have six commissioners for each State as to have one commissioner for all the States, who will know nothing except that which he is told by his six inspectors. The commissioner would not be able to listen to the local men. Perhaps the inspector would go up, and be treated very well. We know how inspectors travel through the country, and when the whole affairs of the departments are in their hands, do you think they will ever get to a man with a grievance1! They will never see the poor man who is being ill-treated, and he will not get justice. Suppose, for instance, that the postmaster at Kalgoorlie has a dozen men in his employ. He may know when the inspector is coming round, but his officers will know nothing about the coming visit. </para>

                        <para>- He has a very much better tenure. He has a tenure during good behaviour, and that is much more secure. What will be the result at the end of the seven years' term for which the Public Service Commissioner is to be appointed ? Will it not be that in the case of any difficulty arising in any department at that time the commissioner will be found on the side of popularity in order to secure re-appointment? In the interests of economy and efficiency in the various departments, this amendment ought to be agreed to, with a view to striking out all references to inspectors altogether. I can well imagine that the commissioner, whoever he may be, will be chosen because he will be considered one of the best organizers we can possibly get for £1,500 a year : but I point out that the head of a department is chosen for just the same reason, and in addition he will be thoroughly conversant with the branch of the service over which he presides. The commissioner may be taken, for instance, from the Customs department, and may not be conversant with the Post and Telegraph department at all, and he would need to acquire a knowledge of the best methods of conducting that great institution successfully. I can see no reason why we should provide twelve eyes and twelve ears for the commissioner, when, if he is a thorough organizer of industry, he will, by walking into an office, be able to ascertain whether the men there are- fully employed, and the work is properly organized,and there is no reason why he should not travel through the length and breadth of the land and make a report to the head of the department, who, having an intimate knowledge of the working of the department will be able at once to judge whether the commissioner is correct in his recommendations or not. By placing these continual buffers between ourselves and the Ministry we are neutralizing our power as a Parliament, and destroying the whole principle of self-government and of responsible government. </para>

                    <para>- As one of those who think it is absolutely necessary for an efficient service that we should have inspectors, I am prepared to support the clause as it stands. I am not prepared to say how many inspectors are necessary, bub under the Bill it is provided that the number shall not exceed six. The necessity for inspectors is that we want to thoroughly re-organize the departments that have been transferred to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I want to have all possible safeguards against unfair treatment, and in the interests of the Commonwealth we must see that these men, whom we are going to pay well, shall do the work of the Commonwealth to the best of their ability. If we consider this matter carefully we must see that inspectors are absolutely necessary. I can understand a difference of opinion as to the necessity for a commissioner, but when we have decided to have a commissioner I cannot understand how persons can say that it is not absolutely necessary to have inspectors to go round and obtain information. The Minister will receive reports, recommendations, and suggestions from the commissioner, and he can go to the head of the department and ask for a report, as provided for in the Bill. When he has reports from two sources he will be in a position to ascertain what the service is like; but without the aid of the commissioner and the inspectors he will be at the mercy of the heads of the department, who will be absolute autocrats in the various States. I cannot see how the system can be made efficient and continuous throughout the Commonwealth, unless we adopt this means. I sincerely hope that the committee will see its way to adopt the provision in the clause. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and some Members of Parliament require inspecting ! It would not be a bad line if we had an inspector appointed for the two Houses of Parliament ! The inspectors, as the Postmaster-General wisely said in introducing this Bill, will be the eye3 and ears of the commissioner, and will convey to him the information they collect. Acting upon that information the commissioner will make recommendations to the Government, who will be responsible to Parliament, and if the Minister does not adopt those recommendations he will have to give some reasons why they have not been adopted. Therefore the Parliament and the Government do not lose their control. Taking the Government scheme as a whole, it is framed upon plain and reasonable lines, and is calculated to bring about the very best results for all parties concerned. My strongest reason for supporting the proposal is that it contains this provision in respect of the appointment of six inspectors. That number is little enough. I do not agree with the Minister in saying that at the beginning it may not be necessary to appoint six. My opinion is that the requirements of the Commonwealth will demand the appointment of the whole six. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate this committee should take into consideration the duties that will devolve upon the inspectors, the vast territory they will have to travel over, and the number of civil servants that will be under them. In the State of Queensland we have officers spread over a great territory. We have no fewer than 83 Custom-houses, and many post and other public offices along our sea-board, which is about 2,000 miles in length, to say nothing of the great interior. I cannot understand honorable senators who come from States which have large territories opposing this proposal. They must know that it is impossible for the heads of departments to visit the different places where there are officers under their control. </para>

                        <para>- All that I agree with, but it can be efficiently attained under the Bill as it stands. I ask any honorable senator who has had experience among the people whether the complaint has not always been that we should trim down from the top of the tree, and that we have too many highly-paid civil servants. The service is top-heavy. That is the general complaint, and any honorable senator who says otherwise has not listened to the opinions of the people who have- to pay the money to maintain the civil service. But we are going to add to this top-heavy service by appointing other highly-paid officers. Some honorable senators say they support the Government proposal for the purpose of saving money. I would point out to them that no money is going to be saved in this direction. </para>

Why, they would lose themselves, and it would cost the Commonwealth thousands of pounds to fit up expeditions to go and look for them ! The inspectors are not going to the out-of-the-way places where, there is no one living. They are not going into the wilderness of Western Australia, or of Queensland, or of Central Australia. There are no officers there. Much of the territory is unexplored. There are thousands of miles in this Commonwealth where a white man has never trod. </para>

They would be men in touch with the work of the department in the various States, while under the Bill the Postmaster-General may get a number of men who may be novices in the working of the department. We have no guarantee that the inspectors appointed will be men who are connected with the public service. I would ask honorable senators to strike out the provision for inspectors, on the ground that we have all that we require in the existing means for acquiring information, and if a channel is required through which the grievances of employes can filter, it will be best found in the appointment of a board of appeal. </para>

                    <para>- Where the suspension is by the Governor-General the Minister has to lay before both Houses a full statement of the grounds of suspension. That gives Parliament control, and" does not make fish of one and flesh of the other. It is placing the inspectors on exactly the same footing as regards the control of Parliament as the commissioner. Under clause 6 the commissioner may suspend an inspector, and under clause 46 an inquiry is to be made. And then, on receiving the recommendation of the commissioner, the Governor-General may fine the inspector or deal with him under sub-clause (1) of clause 6. It is a kind of mixed and double arrangement. On the one hand, you place the inspectors on the same footing as the commissioner, with both subject to the power of suspension, qualified by the condition that the grounds of suspension must be laid before Parliament. On the other hand, you place the inspectors for this purpose in the position of subordinate officers of the commissioner, liable to suspension at his hands, to an inquiry by a board, then to fine and so on, or it may be to some subsequent suspension, the case having been prejudged in the meantime by the commissioner - by his first suspension,. and by the report of the board, on which the Governor-General may not act. He may either fine him or abstain from acting. In either case we have engrafted on the original scheme of commissioner and inspectors independent except of suspension by the Executive, and subject to the control of Parliament, a suspension by the commissioner as though the inspectors were subordinate officers. Surely one or the other ought to prevail. I think 15 c z the criticisms of Senators Pearce and Ewing are amply justified. </para>

                        <para>- It shows clearly what his position is in regard to the commissioner. Is there any inconsistency that we should provide afterwards that the commissioner in certain cases may suspend him ? What the committee has to face iri connexion with the point which has been raised is whether or not it is desirable to put the inspectors on a footing with the commissioner. The Bill makes the inspectors subordinate to the commissioner. If you alter the Bill in that direction, you will put the inspectors practically on the same level with the commissioner, and instead of having one commissioner, and three, or four, or six inspectors, you will have four, or five, or perhaps seven commissioners, with perhaps more prospect of dissension and trouble than we have had in some of the States with three commissioners. That is what the amendment means. It is not an amendment which deals directly with the alteration proposed to be made ; it is an amendment which certainly will lead up to another that will tend to put the inspectors on the same footing as the commissioner. I think it is most undesirable that anything of the kind should be done. </para>

                    <para>- In clause 7, the duties of the inspectors are laid down, but surely there must be some means taken to decide when and how they are to be performed? Surely it is not intended that the inspectors, irrespective of the commissioner, are to wander all over the place at their own sweet will, and do just as they like, restricted only by the duties laid down in clause 8 ? There must be a head, and surely he must have the power of directing what duties shall be done, and how they shall be done, and not have each time to appeal to the Governor-General to decide whether an inspector should be sent to Western Australia or to Queensland to look into a certain case? I am at a loss to understand on what ground the honorable senator can have proposed to insert " Governor-General" in lieu of "commissioner." There are six inspectors, and some one must tell them what their duties are, and how those duties are to be discharged. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister cannot possibly do it. The Public Service Commissioner knows best what the duties of the staff are, and how the officers can best be allocated. He should be the authority to decide whether the inspector shall be in one place or another. </para>

                        <para>- "Bach inspector sholl act during the pleasure of the GovernorGeneral," means that the Governor-General is the man to remove the inspector, if it means anything, If a man is to serve in an office during my pleasure it means that I am the monto remove him. The commissioner assigns the duties to be exercised by the inspector, and the inspector performs those duties until he is removed by the man who appoints him, namely, the Governor-General. lt does not mean that the Governor-General has to assign ali the duties that the inspectors are to exercise, but simply that the inspectors are to act as the commissioner directs, and to carry out those duties during the pleasure of the Governor-General. </para>
