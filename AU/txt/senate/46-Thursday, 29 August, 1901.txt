                        <para>- I am not aware of any such alleged fact. There has- been a room: on the Senate- side set apart, for the use of the- members of the- Legislative Council -of Victoria, ever since we- have been in possession of the building. I understand, that they consider that room too small, but that does not alter the fact that a room has been set aside for their use if they choose to make use of. it. They ask that some other room shall be placed entirely at their disposal; but, until a contract has been signed, it is difficult to comply with their request-. The joint House Committee, which did me the honour to appoint me their chairman, decided that matters should remain as they are until a contract has been signed. They were of opinion that they ought to leave everything as it is until they can make final arrangements, and they conceived that final arrangements can not be made in regard to the allotment of rooms and other matters affecting the control of this building until after a formal contract has been entered into. </para>

                        <para>- I can say that an agreement is likely to be arrived at I see no reason why it should not. There are negotiations going on which must come to a. conclusion soon, but when, I cannot tell the honorable senator;Ican assure him that there is not the least likelihood of there being any hitch in the proceedings which is likely to result in the revocation of the present arrangement. Practically an agreement has been arrived at, but there is some difficulty as to particular details of it. </para>

                    (New South Wales - Vice-President of the Executive Council). - If this was a committee which could possibly have any other than one petition to consider I certainly should oppose the amendment, because it appears to me that if we are to have our proceedings properly constituted and carried on - if we decide that a committee should consist of so many members, especially in this House where each member represents a State, I think it is highly desirable that its constitution should be maintained whenever a vacancy occurs. If there was any other application of the powers of this committee likely to take place I certainly should oppose the amendment. But I want to deal with this matter in a practical way. It is quite evident that there is only one petition likely to be considered by the committee. Its work so far as one can see will be confined to that petition. If the Chairman, as representing the committee, had expressed any wish to oppose the amendment, or if any honorable senator had opposed the suggestion, I, certainly should have listened with a very great deal of respect to his observations. But as apparently it does not meet with any opposition on the part of any member of the committee, as the committee I gather from their silence seem to think that their proceedings can be carried on without any addition, I do not propose to oppose the amendment.

                    <para>- I cannot accept' the honorable senator's amendment. I think that if he will look' at the legislation on this matter in other parts of the world, he will find that this clause follows the invariable practice in providing that the mere existence of a hole, or pipe, or any device which may be used for smuggling on a ship is something at all events which calls upon the master for an answer. In section 179 of the English Act the words - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Any secret or disguised place adapted for concealing goods or any hole, tube, pipe, or device adapted for running goods - are to be found. The New Zealand and the New South Wales Acts contain the same provision, lt is quite obvious why it is unnecessary in these cases to prove the knowledge of the ship-owners. It would be almost impossible to do so. If a ship-owner had on board one of his vessels a crew from some Eastern country, for instance, and a number of holes or pipes were found on that vessel, containing hundreds of pounds worth of goods, the captain would simply say - " I am very sorry. I happen to have a very unscrupulous crew, arid I do not know anything about this matter." On the other hand, if we make the mere existence of these devices for smuggling an offence, we may be sure that in the administration of the Act, care will 'be taken that the captain is not punished if it is shown that he has no knowledge on the subject, while at the same time the captain will make it his duty and the duty of his officers to keep a sharp look-out for anything of the sort. Who could better aid in the prevention of smuggling by these devices than the captain 'and officers themselves ? We may be sure that they will give the department their assistance if it is made obligatory on them to do so, at the risk of a penalty on the owner for the existence of such devices. In Great Britain and in all the States precisely the same provision has existed, and I do not know that there has ever been any serious complaint in regard to its administration. This is one of the very large powers that we must give to the Customs officials, and we must trust to its reasonable exercise by them. Unless there is some pretty strong evidence to show that a captain had knowledge of the existence of such devices on board his ship, one could not understand his being made liable. I would therefore ask the committee not to alter the sub-clause, and not to consent, at a time when above all others we should take care that there is no leakage of the revenue, to take away a safeguard which has existed in all Customs Acts in Great Britain and the Australian States for very many years. </para>

                    <para>- I am quite sure the committee sympathize with the desire of the Government to prevent any leakage of revenue. We realize that it is highly important that the Commonwealth should receive every penny of revenue to which it is lawfully entitled, but the clause itself seems to be rather serious in its effects. We must bear in mind that it does not provide for forfeiture of the ship after certain proceedings are taken, but that a ship shall be absolutely forfeited by statute if it is found to contain any hole, pipe, or other device adapted for the purpose of running goods. This is a case in which I think provision might very well have been made for a money penalty, so that punishment by forfeiture of the. ship would not be possible. I sympathize with the Government, but at the same time I also strongly sympathize with the position taken by the mover of the amendment, because it is perfectly clear that we must give fair consideration to the general public in any clause we pass. Let us make the provisions as stringent as possible, but do not let us go beyond what is fair and equitable to the parties concerned; Possibly the amendment might be accepted, but with the proviso that the captain of a vessel on which any of these devices were found should be liable to a. penalty of £500. Then there would be a prosecution, and it would be possible to show the condition of affairs that existed. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the insertion of " to the knowledge of the master" is an amendment of considerable importance. I have had a good deal of experience as a sea-going engineer, and as such traded for a great many years to the East. I have seen much smuggling on board steamers, and I have known devices to be adopted of which I am sure the captain, could not possibly have been aware. If this clause were administered strictly, very serious results might happen to the ship. 1 remember on one occasion that, whilst I was walking round the grating above the boilers of a vessel on which I was employed as an officer, I came across a plank about ten nr. twelve feet long by two inches thick. My foot went through it, and I found that it was hollowed out, so that it would just take in thin tins of opium. I' presume it had been used for the purpose of smuggling, but no one knew anything about it. If, as engineer on board that vessel, I had failed to discover that plank, I cannot see how the master of the- ship-would have been able to find it out. </para>

I have generally found that ship's officers have very little interest in preventing smuggling on the part of passengers or crew, but leave that matter to the Customs officers ; but a provision such as this will cause them to take care that nothing of the kind is done. I hope the sub-clause will be passed, for the protection of the public against the fraudulent intentions of the few. </para>

                    <para>- There seems to be an omission with regard to the interpretation of" shall be forfeited." Those words, when used in reference to goods, really mean that the goods shall be liable to forfeiture. 'On a seizure of the goods as forfeited, notice has to be given to the owner, who may then claim them ; and if the collector thinks there is innocence on his part; the goods may be restored without further proceeding. If, however, the collector chooses not to restore the goods, the owner is put to his action to question the legality of the condemnation. Clauses 197 and 198 refer to both ships and goods; but clause 199, which shows what the owner must do in order to test the legality of the condemnation, is limited to goods. In my opinion this provision ought to embrace both ships and goods. There appears to have been a clerical omission. </para>

                        <para>- I think the paragraph must remain as it stands. Probably every time the honorable senator comes from New South Wales he is asked whether he has any dutiable goods. That question is often put to me, and I know that when I' reply in the negative 1 take the risk of assuming knowledge as to what are dutiable goods. No person is bound to say that he has no such goods, but if he takes the risk it is his own look-out. I think this provision must really lead to a saving of time, because it enables the Customhouse officer, instead of going through a traveller's baggage, to ask the question whether any dutiable goods,are contained in it, knowing that if the answer is in' the negative the traveller takes the risk of a prosecution. By the statement being made at the risk of punishment, the passenger is put really upon inquiry. It is a great convenience to passengers and Customs officials alike. </para>

                <para>I think it is necessary to put in that provision, otherwise goods innocently shipped might be liable to be seized and forfeited with the rest of a package. The. clause means that certain goods are liable to forfeiture. A package is seized by the Customs as containing goods liable to forfeiture under this clause, and all goods in that package are liable to forfeiture because the package has been seized. Although some of them should not be forfeited, yet under the concluding words of this clause the whole contents come under the ban. </para>

                <para>Any package having concealed therein goods not enumerated in the entry or being so packed as to deceive the officer - shall be forfeited. A package being forfeited, all the goods contained in it are 'forfeited, whether they are prohibited or not. With regard to the first part of this clause, it is clear that if the goods are forfeited the package should be forfeited, and the latter part of the clause clearly refers to exceptional eases where the package itself is declared to be forfeited. The only instance that occurs to me is that in the clause we have just passed, where the package seized is being used for the purpose of smuggling. Where a package has been put up in such a way as to deceive a Customs officer, all the goods contained in it are to be forfeited. In view of the various clauses in this Bill and in other Customs Acts, such as those relating to the forfeiture of ships possessing contrivances for the purpose of smuggling, it does not seem too much to say that where a package seized is packed for the purpose of smuggling goods, everything in that package shall be forfeited. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know that any of Zola's novels are so very bad that they must be excluded from the community. This is not a fair provision, because it provides for the forfeiture of the packages, and the forfeiture of a package means the forfeiture of everything contained in it. It is said we have sensible men administering the Customs law ; but sometimes I doubt that when I hear what has been done in the past. If the Customs officials are not to carry out the provision, why put it in the Bill ? The necessities of the department would be absolutely met by forfeiting the packages in which these goods come, but not necessarily forfeiting the whole of the goods. I would suggest that' all the words after " contained " be struck out. </para>

If, under these circumstances, a man packed some prohibited books with other works, with no intention of deceiving, but without the knowledge that they had been prohibited, the whole case of books might be forfeited. I ask whether that is just or fair. We ought not to give such power to the Collector of Customs, and in the next breath tell him that he is not to exercise it. The clause gives him imperative instructions to forfeit the whole case or package.

This clause goes a good deal further ; but if it could be qualified in the direction which has been indicated, there would not be the slightest objection to the provision. I believe the clause' has something to do with a difficulty which occurred some years ago, when, in the case of the importation of some prohibited machinery, the owner held that, while the goods could be forfeited, the cases could not be seized. The result was that the goods had to be opened on the wharf and carted away at considerable expense to the Customs, the cases being left on the wharf. It is right that that difficulty should be met, but, as I say, the clause goes further. If
                    will insert words limiting the clause to attempted evasion of the Customs, I shall be perfectly satisfied.

The clause may be divided into two parts, which have no connexion one with the other. In the first place, it is provided that where goods have been forfeited, the case goes with them and is forfeited too. There is no difficulty as to that. The other part of the clause states what happens when the package has been forfeited.

                    will no doubt be justified in voting for the clause, that is if, as he puts it, the only cases in which a package could be forfeited are comprised in paragraph
                    of clause 220. But a package can be forfeited under clause 221, merely because it contains one prohibited article. If one prohibited article be found in it, not only the package, but everything it contains, no matter whether legally imported or not, is to be forfeited. I submit that the construction put by
                    is not consistent with the facts of the case.

But the clause we are discussing shows how a package can be forfeited which may contain one forfeitable article with several non-forfeitable ones. Take a case which is found to contain one forfeitable book and 199 non-forfeitable books. That package can be forfeited in spite of the assurance of

                    <para>- The provisions of this clause bring into very vivid relief the fact that there is one law for the public, and another law for the Custom-house officers. We have just passed a clause which subjects to the possibility of five years' imprisonment 'any poor wretch who does a bit of smuggling. Now we are asked to pass a provision which would enable a well paid Custom-house officer to be guilty of a breach of trust, and also to be guilty of smuggling or other great offence, and to&gt; connive at it, and be liable to imprisonment for only three years. That is not fair. If the punishments were properly distributed, a well paid officer who is found to be guilty, not only of a great breach of trust, but of defrauding the Customs, should- be liable to. the higher punishment. A recent cablegram has informed us of the discovery in. New York of some great frauds in the silk trade brought about by some Customhouse officer, which, it is said, represent millions, of dollars. I am not sure whether it means that the frauds represent millions of dollars, or that they are connected with goods of that value. I propose to transpose paragraph (a) to immediately after the word, "whoever," and to insert after the word' " seizure " the words - </para>

In the interests of honest traders this clause should stand. A penalty for an evasion of duty cannot be too high, not only in the interests of the Custom-house, but for the protection of the honest trader. only wish the clause was a little more stringent. </para>

                    (New South Wales).The point raised by
                    is that all penalties previously passed and approved by this committee are really not the penalties at all, inasmuch as a special penalty is provided for in this clause. The penalty of £100 attached to previous clauses only relates to cases where the goods do not exceed the value of £33, and when I approved of that penalty I thought it was the maximum. Once the goods go beyond that value, however, the offence comes under this clause, which provides that the penalties previously imposed shall be pushed on one side, and that a penalty not less than three times the value of the goods shall be inflicted. The next clause goes on to still further increase the maximum.

                    <para>- The reason for the insertion of the clause in this form is this : It may be that a large quantity of. goods are involved in the commission of some offence under the Act. The penalty may be £50, but the advantage gained in regard to the goods themselves may amount to some hundreds of pounds. If the only punishment were forfeiture of , the goods, it would be worth a. man's while to run the risk. </para>

                        <para>- Because it is impossible to say beforehand what advantage a man may gain by violating one of these clauses. Of course, the forfeiture of the goods is provided for, but it is necessary in addition to provide a penalty. There can be no difficulty in ascertaining in each case what is the penalty under these various clauses. The man who attempts to evade the Customs law in regard to certain goods knows perfectly well that, if the penalty specially provided for is less than three times the value of the goods, there must be added to it the penalty fixed by this clause. There is no uncertainty about the matter. </para>

                        <para>- No, it is not. In that case the maximum is treble the value of the ' goods. In the general smuggling section of the New South Wales Act it is provided that the offender "shall for each such offence forfeit either treble the value of the goods, or £100, at the election of the collector." Instead of leaving it to the election of the collector, we have provided a much more reasonable rule - that where the penalty provided is less than three times the value of the goods, then the maximum shall be thrice the value of the goods. We practically follow the laws of other places. It is necessary that we should impose such penalties in order to make it not worth while for a man to run the risk of smuggling. </para>

I have no objection to the penalty being as high as it can be made for evil-doers, and the objection I raise is against what I call the slovenly workmanship in the Bill we are asked to pass. In the English Act, after all the offences are enumerated, the penalty is provided as £100, or three times the value of the goods.

                    <para>- It is a well-known rule of law in summary proceedings that no man shall be charged on one information with the commission of two offences. Under this clause, however, a man may be charged, first of all, with an offence against the Act, and then with an attempt to defraud the revenue, and a double penalty is provided. It is introducing a novel thing to provide that persons can be charged under this Bill in a way in which they cannot be charged under any other Act. It would be well to omit this clause, or to recast it so as to provide' that a person must be charged with an intent to defraud the revenue. The clause provides for a double charge. If a . man commits an act without intent to defraud, he is punished, while if he does it with intent to defraud, he is punished doubly. </para>

                    has to a great extent avoided the issue. According to his argument, a man who refuses or fails to answer questions or produce documents out of sheer obstinacy may be fined to the extent of £100. It is utterly absurd to imagine that any court would fine a man such an amount for an offence of that character.

A person ought to be charged with intent to defraud, and proceedings taken on that issue straight away in all summary proceedings. I admit that if it can be proved that a man has done a particular act with intent to defraud the revenue, he should be liable to a more severe penalty than another who has not sought to defraud, but let the charge be made in the first instance for the offence which the prosecution thinks it can maintain. </para>

                    <para>- I do not see any difficulty about the clause. It has been provided in all recent legislation that, although a man is charged with a major offence, he may, nevertheless, be convicted of a minor offence with which he is not charged at' all. This clause merely provides that a man may be charged with the two things at once. The Government propose to take the person accused entirely into their confidence, and say to him - " If we happen to prove that you did this thing innocently, through pigheadedness or for some other reason, your punishment will be so much ; but incidentally if we happen to prove that you were acting deliberately, with a fraudulent intention, you will be liable to the utmost penalty." Which of us would not rather know the whole extent to which he is charged, and rely on the general criminal law? I think this is an excess of consideration, and I am surprised at the moderation of the Government. </para>

                    <para>- Several times when we have come to a provision for the infliction of a large penalty, I have drawn attention to the fact, and I now draw attention to the necessity of omitting this clause, with a view to giving the court the power to inflict a small minimum penalty where the offence is really of a, trivial or nominal character. I propose to vote against the clause. </para>

                    <para>- This is really a very convenient way of fixing a minimum penalty all through the Bill. It is a constant practice in Bills to fix a minimum penalty as well as a maximum. It is a good thing very often that there should be no power to go beyond the minimum, for the reason that the offence should be known to the public to cany with it a certain punishment, which, under no circumstances, can be abated. All through this Bill Customs offences are treated on a different basis from other offences. The object of that difference is to deal stringently with them, and, above all, to let persons know that no matter what circumstances they may bring before the court, the lowest penalty which may be inflicted on them is mentioned as well as the highest. It is really a question of whether we should adhere to the principle we have followed, and that is, to make it particularly Stringent against the dishonest trader. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - In clause 225 eight different offences are mentioned. The first two of them are serious ones. Where a person evades payment of duty or obtains a drawback which is not payable - where there is clear and absolute fraud - I do not think the penalty of £100, with the power of reducing it to £5, is misplaced. But where a person misleads an officer in any particular likely to affect the discharge of his duty, although it may be a very trifling matter the fine is to be £100. We can conceive circumstances where a minimum fine of £5 would be a great injustice. Again, take a case arising under paragraph (A) of clause 225. Some person might offer an article which in itself was only worth a shilling, and stated that he was selling the article cheap because it was a prohibited import or smuggled. Would £5 be a reasonable fine to inflict in that case
                    I can see no valid reason why the clause should be retained.

It has always been recognised that it is necessary to make a Customs Act exceedingly draconic, and in previous clauses we have recognised that necessity. Let me call attention to section 243 of the New Zealand Act which deals with many of these same matters ; that is to say, making a declaration untrue in any particular, or when required to answer questions put by the proper officer not truly answering them or using counterfeits or false documents. </para>

I do not sympathize with him when he casts a slur upon any magistrate who may be called upon to administer these clauses. Whether he feels the very greatest doubt as to the competence of these magistrates or whether he does not, I would point out that the Bill empowers these magistrates to vary a penalty from £100 to onetwentieth of that amount.

                            has intimated that these clauses might be badly administered by certain justices. Although he may feel some doubt about their fitness to properly exercise their jurisdiction with regard to this Bill, he is at one and the same time placing in their power the right to reduce the penalty from £100 to- £51 His argument on that ground, therefore, seems to be utterly inconsistent, but I welcome other parts of his argument. He -has indicated that it may be possible for this minimum penalty of £5 to be dispensed with on application to the Minister for Justice. If he admits that, then he admits part of what I contend for, namely, . that there may be cases in which the penalty is too severe.

                        <para>- But we are limiting the discretion of the courts. In a clause which was under discussion a few minutes ago, we provided that if a person refuses to answer questions he shall be liable to a penalty of £100. The questions may be a mere bagatelle, but the man is summoned, and cannot be fined less than £5. Is that reasonable? I know that there is power to petition the Crown for a remission of the penalty, but a Minister is called upon to discharge no more troublesome duty than that of determining the course which the Crown should be recommended to pursue when the department is inundated with requests for remissions of penalties or sentences. Under the Weights and Measures Act cases are constantly cropping up in which applications are made for the remission of fines. The papers have to be remitted to the magistrates, who have in turn to report on them ; inquiries have to be made, and the whole machinery of the Crown has to be brought into play in a matter which could have been better dealt with by the magistrates themselves, at first, with the information fresh in their minds, if there had been no fixed minimum penalty. To a large extent the Minister, in dealing with these applications, is guided by the magistrates in exercising his discretion, if he has any confidence in them, and yet we would not allow the justices to exercise their discretion when the case is before them. I think it is unwise to have high minimums in cases of this character. Where a man has had no intention to defraud, and an offence has been committed almost unwittingly, we propose to make him liable to a fine of not less than £5, and if he wants- to get that reduced he has to petition the Crown, and invoke the aid of the Minister of the day, and the aid of half-a-dozen different officials, in determining that the fine shall be reduced. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. He might be put in gaol in the meantime, for non-payment of the penalty, and practically atone the offence by imprisonment before the matter could be dealt with. I would, therefore, ask the Minister to make the maximum £2 in the case of a penalty of £100 or £50; and in all other cases make it one-twentieth of the maximum. I would rather see no minimum at all fixed, for I think we should leave the matter entirely to the discretion of the magistrates. If a minimum is fixed it should be fixed on such terms as will render it unnecessary for an appeal to be made to the Crown. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. And we have intentional offences for which my honorable and learned friend and myself would impose the maximum. We are all law-makers. We cannot do things thoroughly, but we have to do them as well as we can. In a great number of instances in which the intention cannot be proved, the intention exists. In 99 cases out of a hundred a man who gets off with the minimum fine because he did not understand that he was evading the Customs is practically guilty, but the guilt cannot be brought home to him. </para>

                        <para>- The only way in which we can secure the proper administration of laws dealing with offences which arc not offences against the laws of nature, but against the conventional institutions which are necessary for our well-being, is to make them stringent in this way. We have to say to a man - "Never mind whether you meant to doit or not. It was your business to be aware of this Customs law, and if you did not know of it, you have to be punished, while if you did know of it and understood it you have to be punished very much more." Then it is said - " How shameful it is not to allow a minimum penalty. Some poor innocent fellow may have smuggled goods innocently." I say let the offender thank Heaven the authorities were not able to prove a criminal intent on his part, because as a general rule the persons who commit these offences know all about it. I appeal to the common humanity of every smuggler in this community, when I say that the only way to make our Customs law efficient is to do exactly what the Government are proposing to do, as a result of the world-wide experience of hundreds and thousands of men. We should not leave the penalty to the whim, humour, or mercy of a particular magistrate. We should rather say - " If you do this thing my dear sir, however innocently, you have got at all events to pay this penalty." If a man chooses to commit these offences let him pay, and let him also be thankful that the authorities have not been able to prove the intent which undoubtedly existed. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I am uninfluenced by anything that
                    has said, or by any of his quotations from the Acts of the other States. The Commonwealth at present is engaged in evolving a Customs law for itself, and I submit that, instead of adopting conditions and penalties which are more or less obsolete, and which are already in process of being discarded or reduced by other communities, we should arrange our system of penalties on a basis that we can at least justify to our own conscience, and which is consonant with the principles of fair play and justice.
                    in his recent speech spoke about a man innocently smuggling goods, as though we referred to an offence like that, or anything approaching it. The offence of smuggling must of necessity be dealt with in a severe manner. Clause 69 provides that goods may be unshipped only pursuant to a collector's permit or the passing of an entry, under a penalty of £100. Under that clause, if any person has received by steamer some small shipment of goods, worth, perhaps, only £2 or £3, and he omits to pass an entry, and the goods are put on shore, he incurs a penalty of £100, which cannot, under the clause as it stands, be reduced to less than £5. This is a small offence of omission, and yet the heavy minimum penalty of £5 is to be inflicted. With a view to bringing this matter to a conclusion, and doing what I think to be fair all round, I move -

                        <para>- The limitation to five years is rather longer than we might reasonably expect to find in a Bill of this kind. In the Imperial Act the time for beginning a prosecution is limited to three years. If the Customs authorities have a case in which they intend to prosecute they should proceed within as reasonable a time as possible. Of course, there may be circumstances under which it cannot be done immediately, but I think three years will be a quite sufficient period within which to institute a Customs prosecution. I suggest to the Minister that it is reasonable to re duce the time to three years. </para>

                    <para>- I do not feel disposed to accept an amendment. In a prosecution for an ordinary indictable offence there is no limit ; you can bring the proceeding at any time. If you are sueing a man in a civil case you can bring the proceeding within six years. This clause imposes a limitation of five years. In ordinary circumstances the prosecution will be brought as soon as possible. In very exceptional cases, such as where the fraud is not discovered, or something else takes place which prevents a prosecution being initiated, five years, I think, is a reasonable limitation. </para>

Although a man may have gone to gaol for a specified time, it does not. purge the liability for the payment of the-' penalty if it can be recovered at a later date. Again, consider the class of cases to which a pecuniary penalty is attached. In one clause we" have provided that where a. man is liable for an act he has committed in contravention of the law, and is also guilty of an attempt to defraud the revenue, he is liable, not to imprisonment straight away, but to a double penalty. In this clause we are going back on a principle which should guide us in all matters of criminal jurisprudence. </para>

                        <para>- Although an offence of that character is punishable by a fine in certain cases, still, you can not put the individual in the witness-box and compel him to give evidence. Where the offence is of a more serious and grave nature it is undesirable, in the interests of the public generally, that we should adopt this provision, because it would offer a direct incentive to a man to commit the crime of perjury. A great many men would not think twice about committing perjury in order to save' themselves from a penalty such as is provided for in this Bill. It is contrary to the interests of the community to legislate in such a way as will unnecessarily induce persons to commit crime. If we enact that an accused man is competent to' give evidence, and he enters the witness box, he is liable to cross-examination, he will put himself in that position deliberately ; but if he is charged with the commission of an offence, and has no evidence in rebuttal, under the next clause he will be liable to conviction for an offence of a character indicated by the clause under which he is compellable to give evidence. </para>

                        <para>- It means that a man can be examined in all sorts of ways as to his character and his previous life. He can be asked questions which have nothing to do with the prosecution in order to test his credibility, and every man who knows what cross-examination at the hands of skilful counsel is knows not only how vigorous, but -how cruel it is at times. Unfortunately we know there are certain counsel who, if there is the slightest stain on a witness's character, will drag it out before the world so as to intimidate, him from giving evidence which might be truthful. A person might give evidence which is not exactly true in order to please such counsel. We do not want any such provision in our customs law. We should not say that if there is a stain against the character of a man brought up for an offence it is to be dragged out, although it may be in respect of an act committed many years ago. </para>

                        <para>- But he may be asked questions to test his credibility, and matters may be dragged up which occurred twenty years before. That is not a fair thing. If it is desirable to adopt such a dra'stic course in regard to a small offence, why not adopt the same drastic course in order to obtain a conviction for an indictable offence 1 We are making the Bill an instrument of oppression instead of an instrument to insure the conviction of a guilty man. The amendment I would suggest is that after the word " competent " we should insert the words " but not compellable." Then the second sub-section should be eliminated altogether. Of course, if a man is sworn on his own behalf he has to put up with the consequences which attach to any witness before a court. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so, but I am Suggesting that most of these trivial offences will all centre round the fact that the man, though he was not trying to evade duty, or endeavouring to pay less duty than the law compelled him to pay, and, as in most, cases, the proceedings will have been started by the declaration of the importer, it appears to me that on that declaration the prosecution ought to be able to ask him about his books and his invoices, and to cross-examine him as a hostile witness in regard to all his dealings with the different houses from whom he imports. If we do not allow that to take place, we put the Customs department at an absolute disadvantage in dealing with every man who tries by illegal acts to defraud the revenue. All these attempts to defraud the Customs are managed in a skilful way. The intending smuggler has to make arrangements of an illegal character before he ventures on a smuggling transaction, and it is more necessary to put every power in the hands of the authorities under the Customs Act than in connexion with any other Act. We have every right to put this power into the hands of the men who have to collect £8,500,000 through the Customs for the Common wealth. There are two essential points- one is the protection of the revenue, and the other the protection of the honest trader against the illegal trader.</para>

The clause we are dealing with now has no application in the first place to indictable offences.

I would remind the honorable and learned senator that in all cases of proceedings in bankruptcy, where .a bankrupt is put dato' the box to be examined to .get information out of him, he may be cross-examined and compelled to produce books and documents, and all his dealings may be probed in 'every way. This clause is for the purpose of putting the defendant in -the same position as a person examined in bankruptcy, and that is why this power is asked for. </para>

                    (Western Australia).This is a very important clause, which deserves the serious consideration of the Senate. What has brought about the present state of the law on this point in England and in the States ? The whole tendency of the age has been to cast the onus of proving an offence on the person making the charge. The clause is the thin end of the wedge ; and the day will come, if we authorize this sort of thing in connexion with Customs prosecutions, when it will be extended to other classes of prosecutions, and a man will be put in the dock, and compelled to prove his innocence. One of the privileges which has been extracted by representative government for the people has been that no man shall be detained in prison or held to be guilty until he has been proved so. The clause is simply harking back to the dark ages before Magna Charta, when a man could be put in prison without any charge being proved against him. The Crown is given the advantage, the Moment, it lays an information, of putting the defendant in the dock as a criminal, and he is assumed to be guilty. In no Bill or Act in British speaking countries has such a tiling been heard of since the days when we demanded for every citizen the right of fair trial. It is unjust that, merely because an official of the Customs lays an information, a man shall be held guilty, and the onus cast on him of proving his innocence. It may be urged that a man can easily prove his innocence ; but we know that juries very often disbelieve a witness on account of his attitude in the witness-box, and if a man apparently equivocates they jump to the conclusion that he is saying what is not true. The reason that a man charged with an offence is not subject to cross-examination is that he may not be open to misrepresentation. A man charged with a serious offence knows that his liberty depends on his answer, and the consequence is that in nine cases out of ten he is in a very nervous and excited condition. He very often says that which is not strictly true, and that is why Judges exclude confessions made by persons under certain circumstances. The law up to quite lately was that no man charged with an offence could give evidence in his own defence, it being recognised that a man charged would generally endeavour, even to the extent of perjury, to protect himself against the consequences of his crime. The law was extended so as to allow a person to give evidence on his own behalf, but it was enacted that he should not be compellable to give evidence, and, further, that if he did not choose to go into the box the jury were not justified in making any inference from that fact.

                        <para>- And counsel went on a little worse from being pulled up, tired out the Judge, and got in all the nasty things he wanted to say. Under clause 189 if the driver of a vehicle does not pull up when a Customs officer hails him, under the impression or suspicion that he is conveying dutiable goods, he is liable to a penalty of £20. Again, under clause 251, a man is liable to one month in gaol if he does not pay a penalty of £20. Imagine an unfortunate drayman who is instructed to catch a steamer, or to reach a warehouse or a store by a certain hour, being hailed to stop by some person who is not in uniform. If he does not stop quickly enough, or does not stop at all, he is liable to a penalty of £20 or a month in gaol, and he may be cross examined into convicting himself. Under. British law a man is innocent until he is proved guilty, but under this clause a man is not only to be deemed guilty when arrested or charged, but every effort, rightly. or wrongly; is to be made to convict him, even out of his own mouth. I repudiate such a proposal as that contained in this clause. It is an outrage on every known rule of British law and British right. It is a bare-faced attempt to set back the clock of British justice and to bring in a system of convicting by extorting confession at any hazard, and in defiance of every known safeguard which has hitherto hedged in the administration of British justice. I am astonished that the Ministry of all the talents, and representing all the high constitutionalisms of Australia, should bring forward a proposition of this kind to secure convictions at any price. </para>

                    (South Australia).I look upon such a clause as this with considerable alarm. In South Australia the tendency has been to extend this principle to other measures, and whenever we fought against the extension we were always referred to the Customs Act as a precedent to guide us. In the interests of liberty, and. in the interests of justice, we ought not, in starting the Commonwealth, to establish a precedent which will rob the citizen of his liberty.

                    <para>- I also think that the clause goes further than we might fairly be asked to go to enable the Customs authorities to press home their prosecutions I am surprised that my free-trade friends do not. require that all legislation dealing with Customs taxation) is necessarily brutal ; it is, in fact; taxation extorted with a pistol held at the head of the taxpayer; and I think it would perhaps be advisable to allow such clauses as this one to stand. Then Customs taxation would become so objectionable that the people would demand direct attention. However, I presume they are not prepared to carry their free-trade principles to that extent yet. But I think' that the Government might very well be satisfied with the power which is given in clause 246, where the averment is taken to prove the case unless the defendant can bring evidence in rebuttal. I do not see my way clear to support the Government. It would he going back to the dark ages to compel a man to go into the witness box and give evidence which might lead to his own conviction, and at the same time to treat him as a witness adverse to the prosecution. If the clause is not eliminated, the words which treat a witness as a witness adverse to the prosecution should be eliminated. </para>

                        <para>- I can quite see that there may be objections to the last two lines of sub-clause (2), although personally I do not think they are worthy of the serious attention that has been given to them. If the words - and if called as a witness for the prosecution shall be liable to cross-examination as a witness adverse to the prosecution - be struck out, the clause would then be similar to a provision in the New South Wales and New Zealand Acts. </para>

                    <para>- There is nothing new in the clause, which I hope will be accepted by the committee. When a, Customs offence has been committed, punishable by a money penalty, and that penalty is not paid, the imprisonment is a remedy for recovering the money. Every opportunity is given- under "the previous clause for escaping imprisonment by paying. At one time a man could not be released without paying the whole of the penalty, but under clause 25.1 there is a sliding scale by which, on being imprisoned for a certain period, a person may be released on paying a given proportion of the fine. The defendant may be discharged at the end of seven days, where the penalty is under £2, or where it is over £2 and not more than £5, he may be discharged at the end of fourteen days, whether the penalty be paid or- not,, and so the scale goes on to a period of one year, according to the amount of the penalty. If a person is released without paying the penalty, the Customs ought not to- suffer because, instead' of. paying the money,, he has chosen to " take' it ' out," as- it is commonly called. A man by smuggling may gain £300- or £'400j and; on being mulct in* a penalty of £100, may think it would suit, him much better to -stay in gaol rather than pay; and' if there were not this clause,. he could at the- end of the term of' imprisonment snap his fingers at the Customs </para>

                    - There is a distinction between imprisonment as- punishment and imprisonment foi" the purpose of recovering money ; . and it would be quite a new principle of law if the latter imprisonment were to- wipe' out the debt. In1 cases where pecuniary penalty is inflicted for libel or other offences, punishable in that way, the offender must: remain in gaol for the term prescribed, but his remaining there does- not discharge the debt unless he becomes insolvent, which he can do after a- certain period. The clause is- simply to insure-that the Customs authorities are put in the position of recovering money due. It will have- no- operation against an honest trader, and there is nc re on, why a dishonest man should not compensate the Customs- for wrong done.

            <para>
                (New South Wales).This clause leaves the application of penalties and forfeitures entirely to the Minister without any direction at all. I should like to ask
                whether that is a common principle in measures of this kind? The only one that I have had time to refer to is that which prevails in Great Britain, and there I find that the penalties are handed over to the Commissioners for Inland Revenue, to be disposed of by them in such manne)- as the law directs. These penalties may involve very (large sums, and should,no be left entirely to (the disposal .of the Minister. Even if it is not desirable to embody a direction in the Act itself, it may be well to insert the words " as prescribed," so that the Minister may -lay down .a general rule.

                    <para>- in some of the Customs Acts there is a .provision that portion &gt;of a penalty shall go ito the informer, and that the balance shall 'be disposed -of in other ways. In other cases the matter is left, as in the English Act, at the disposal -of the Commissioners,of 'Customs, as the law directs ; or, if there is no direction by the law, then according to the .discretion of the Minister and -his officers. It appears to me that it is very much better to leave the clause as it stands, if we lay down a hard-and-fast rule that the informer shall get a moiety of the penalty, then it wall be compulsory always to give a moiety to him. The Minister may not wish to encourage that means of detecting crime, except in certain' exceptional cases. -Unfortunately, it is necessary, in certain cases, to employ informers. In many instances, however, the Minister may think it advisable not to adopt that system, and the clause leaves it to him to take any course he may think fit. If regulations were prescribed, the Minister's hands would be tied, and *e would have to provide that in certain cases the penalty should &gt;be divided, and that in others some different method should be adopted. Such . a mode of administration would remove the elasticity from the powers which, I think it very desirable the Minister should have in disposing of these penalties. The clause has been deliberately drawn for the purpose of leaving the matter in the hands of the Minister. He conducts his administration under the scrutiny .of Parliament, the press, and public, opinion ; and, if he acts improperly in the distribution of these penalties, :he can .be -brought to .account. For my own part, I should like ito see these prosecutions conducted 'without the assistance of informers. Their -employment is objectionable in many -ways, but as it may be impossible -to do -without them altogether in some cases, the matter should foe eft to the discretion of the Minister. </para>

                    <para>- I have -been -asked by more than one person to -raise the question whether publicity .ought not to be given, tin cases where importers and others are found guilty of certain irregularities or attempts to .defraud the -revenue. It was the -practice in Tasmania for some 'time to publish the -names of such offenders. In one instance, however, a name was kept back owing to .a special effort 'being made on the man's behalf, and consequently the names of all other persons guilty of irregularities have since been withheld. "Honest traders consider that those who are guilty of defrauding the revenue should have their names published just as the name -of a man who infringes a corporation by-law is put before the public. I certainly think that there is very great force in this argument. Every (morning we read in the newspapers of people who howe offended -against simple laws, .and merchants, and importers and others of high repute who are found guilty of offences under this Bill, should have their -names published in the same way. The -publication can be made in such a way .as not to .cause -an injustice to .any man. I can quite understand that a merchant in .a leading position, who has never had a word breathed against 'his name might be found guilty of an irregularity, although lie .never had any intention to defraud. If he went to the Minister, however, .and asked that the dispute be settled, and the Minister discovered that an unintentional irregularity bad been committed, it could be advertised in .that way. The facts could be put forward in such a way that they would not appear as a blot on the character &gt;of .the man. I certainly should not like to see the innocent suffer with the guilty, but the publication of the names of these offenders may be done in such a way as to safeguard the character of the man &gt;w-ho 'unintentionally breaks the law -while exposing the -man who .wilfully does so. Some persons think that -publication -should not take place for a first, 'but for .a second and every subsequent offence. I do not consider that any such distinction .should -be drawn. 'Either 'these -matters should ;be settled .-in the open -room of the collector, where .the press or any of Che public cam come in, or the clause should compel the Minister to publish 'the abort particulars of the dispute which he has settled, .and the order which he has 'made in reference thereto. </para>

                    SARGOOD.No doubt it would, but it is a disgrace to be fined for anything connected with what is supposed to be a fraud on the Customs. Years after, when the details of what was practically -an innocent irregularity had been forgotten, a charge might be brought against an individual that he had been fined for defrauding the Customs, and there would be no means of repelling the charge. As a matter of fact, the course proposed would be most unfair to the honest trader, and to the advantage of the dishonest trader. Instead of doing the latter any harm, it would have distinctly the opposite effect. It would pay him to attempt to defraud the revenue,' in order that his name might be widely advertised. As soon as it was known that a firm was in the habit of doing such a thing there would be a rush of customers to it..

Such persons have to bear all disadvantages attending a public exposure, and yet we propose now to introduce in a Bill of this kind a provision to allow big offenders to escape the penalties of their wrong doing. </para>

                        <para>- We know very well that larger offenders are more likely to have the ear of the Minister than the smaller ones. The more wealthy the smuggler, the more likely he is to have the attention of the Minister. The small offender will have his goods confiscated, because, as a ride, his case will be too .insignificant to secure the attention of the Minister, hope I am not reflecting on .any former Minister of Customs in saying this. I know that the Minister of Customs has a great deal to do, and that he will not have time to deal with the smaller cases. When pressure is brought to bear by .people in high social positions to get him to deal with the case .of a large offender, no doubt he will be .able to find the time. I do not think this is a wise prevision. It only encourages smugglers and others to violate the provisions of the Customs Act. </para>

                    <para>- I think the honorable senator who has just spoken is mistaken in his view that it is only a particular class of person who can take advantage of this clause. This is really a clause which is immensely in the interests of the Customs authorities, because it enables questions of dispute as to the amount of duty, as to the forfeiture of goods, and other matters of that sort to be dealt with expeditiously. If there was not this opportunity of dealing promptly with cases, they would be hung up for months, the time of officers would be taken up in attending courts, and expense would be incurred. It is to the interest of every person who comes into collision with the Customs authorities that his rights should be determined expeditiously by the Minister. There is nothing to prevent a Minister doing exactly what he likes in regard to the question of publication. The practice in Victoria has been to communicate all these cases to the press. </para>

In the bulk of cases regulations are simply laid on the table of the House, and take effect then, if they have not taken effect before. This is a very special provision, and if it be acted upon, that should be done as soon as possible, because the regulations will control business to a very large extent, and the whole mercantile community will be interested in their being passed into law. </para>

                    <para>-This clause deals with " duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State." Does a provision of this. kind really come in a Customs Bill ? Would it not more properly appear in a Bill dealing with excise? </para>

                        <para>- This Bill is to enable statistics to be collected, and as the same authority will collect both Customs and excise statistics, it is more convenient that the authority should be given in one Bill instead of two. </para>
