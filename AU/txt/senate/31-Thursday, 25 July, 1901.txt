I am not going to confess that having had the Constitution read to me dozens of times; I do not understand it better than it has yet been expounded here. All this, however, is beside the "question. This poor ignorant practitioner had a legal representative to protect him, and it has been clearly stated - I do not know- whether it is true or not - that it was pointed out to him or his representative that it was necessary to fulfil the' conditions by presenting the petition to the Senate as the court. Has not that fact been stated ? Does any one deny that it is true ? </para>

Does it not show that there was some one here who understood the difference between the Senate as a legislative body and the Senate as a court. Does it not show that some one here - I do not know who it was - understood the position and pointed out to the poor ignorant petitioner and his legal adviser that it was necessary to present the petition to the Senate as a court.

                            <para>- That is so. That condition, as I have shown, was just as much a necessary condition as the deposit of the £50, or the signature of the petitioner, and every other condition imposed by the Western Australian Act. However, it was neglected. The petition came before the committee, and they found out this omission. The majority of the committee recognised the position that I have . put. I can solemnly declare that I have never consulted any of them in connexion with their proceedings ; but the majority of them came to the same conclusion as I have come to. They held that the Senate is a legislative body, and that it is also a court, and that one of the conditions which they considered necessary had not been complied with. That is exactly the position as it appears to me, and that is why I am going to support the committee. I have not been in Parliament for 20 or 30 or 40 years, but I have been connected with trade societies, and I consider that they are very intelligent bodies. I want to show the irregularity which has cropped up here. If anything would prejudice my mind against the course of action that has been taken by the Government, it is this point. When a committee connected with a friendly society, or a House of Parliament, or a mining company, or anything of the kind, drafts a report, what is done ? The report is presented for adoption. Has that been done here? It has not. What we have before us is a motion that the report be referred back to the committee. In a well-regulated trade society such an informality would not be allowed. What we now have before us would not be taken as a motion at all. It would be taken as an amendment on the motion that the report of the committee be adopted. Why was that not done in this case ? I cannot understand why that course was not followed, but my little experience and my limited intelligence lead me ' to imagine that the course I have mentioned should have been pursued. Someone should have moved, that the report be adopted. Then if there was any one aggrieved - whether that party was a member of the committee or not - he could have moved as an amendment that the report be referred back to the committee. </para>

                            <para>- This, procedure dawns on my dull intellect as an attempt on the part of some one -I do not know who - to have his own way in spite of the majority. That is exactly the position. That some one did not put the motion, as it ought to have been put, in the form of an amendment, but superseded the motion with a motion that ought to have been an amendment. I want to show the moral effect of this. If any trade society, humble as trade societies may be, submit a matter to a committee, and the committee report in a manner which is not approved by the society, the society will move in a certain direction. As a general rule, however, they accept the report. In this case we reject the report, or, at all events, send it back to the committee. In what position are the members of the committee ? They have either to resign - a course which I would not advise them to adopt - or else they have to reconsider their report. If this report is sent back for reconsideration, it must dawn on the minds of members of the committee that it is of no use for them to bring back a report unless they are sure that a majority of the Senate will agree to it. It  would be a disgrace to the Senate if we did not do justice to every one - even justice under the conditions laid down - but it will be a still greater disgrace if, after appointing an advisory body, and sending them away to another room, we tell them not to come back with the report unless they are sure we will agree with it. </para>

The minority concerned in this report have mo wish to take advantage of the absence of two or three of the other members of the committee, and therefore, pairs have been found for them. I fail to see that there is , any censure at : all in this motion moved by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. It is, after all, only that an inquiry should be made. Why should we not make the inquiry ? Does not a Judge in court set aside the verdict of a jury when it is not legal?This report states that the petitioner has- not conformed with the electoral law of the State of  Western Australia, and still the- members who fight against this motion now say that that was not necessary. </para>

                    <para>SenatorMACFARLANE.- There were no laches on the part of the petitioner, unless on a highly legal technical point. That is the position I found myself in when I was in the committee. That is the position I find myself in- now after six hours' debate upon the point. The legal luminaries are all divided upon the legal point, and why, therefore, should not the petitioner have a fair trial upon the merits of his petition? Why should a technical point be taken to prevent him having that trial ? </para>

                            <para>- I believe we have a perfect right to consider whether the conditions had been complied with. Otherwise, as many honorable senators have pointed out, we land ourselves in absolute absurdity. We must see first that the conditions are complied with. When the most skilful lawyers in this Chamber disagree on the matter, .and when we remember that a tribunal which has had legal assistance to come to a decision, and have reported in a certain direction, is it not rather presumptuous of us to attempt to dictate to them on this technical point, and to show to those legal luminaries where they are wrong, and put them right? I consider, as has been stated before, that an  unmerited though an unintentional slight has been put upon the committee in treating their report in the way in which it has been treated. I admit candidly that I made up my mind as to the action I would take on this matter long before that report was brought in. I decided that whatever it was, I would stand by the report of the committee. I think it would have been better, if members of the Senate generally had adopted' that procedure. I consider it is a pity that such matters as this should have to be discussed by a body like this, whose decisions are liable to be tinged with party colour. </para>

                        <para>- I have listened very attentively to the debate from the commencement, and I noticed that legal gentlemen took up nearly the whole of yesterday in debating what I consider trivial legal questions. At all events, they seemed to be pretty nearly divided. There were about the same number holding opposite views, and so far- as I can; see they are as fac off now from, arriving- at a decision! as they were1 at the commencement. At all events they have left me exactly of the same opinion, as at the1 commencement - that- is, that' the petitioner- did all he could to comply with the law;, and that if. there is any mistake at all it is not his fault. I do-not admit that there is a mistake, but if there is a mistake1 it is not" his fault. Therefore it. is our duty te see that he should' receive a hearing - at all events that he should receive justice. It has been mentioned several times' by some senators that it would be unfair or unjust to the committee that their report should be rejected or sent back.. But that is a common' thing in all public- bodies. </para>

Every one who* stands for election knows very well that, he has- to have his nomination paper properly signed. It is within the ordinary knowledge of every candidate for Parliament, also, that he has to final a- certain deposit It is within the knowledge- of every candidate- in every State that he has to comply with certain conditions, which, although they may not be- the same in every State, approach to similarity. But it certainly would not be within the knowledge of every defeated) candidate what would be the exact procedure to be gone through in regard to presenting a petition against the return of a member. I am saying that, believing, implicitly the statement which was made yesterday by the leader of the Government in this Senate. </para>

                            <para>- I think this point was raised simply to frighten honorable senators, and lead them to believe that there will always be a sword of doubt hanging over their heads.Even if such a thing is probable, I am not afraid of any petition being laid against me. If one was lodged, I feel confident that the Senate would do its duty by me and by the petitioner. I consider that it is the duty of the Senate to hear the petitioner and to form its own judgment. I for one will not be found voting with the majority of the committee. I shall be found voting with the leader of the Senate, who desires that the matter be referred back to the committee for further consideration. We are told that the adoption of the motion would practically be an insult to the committee. Nothing of  the kind. We often have to refer reports back to committees in the State Parliaments. I have been on a select committee on a private Bill, and the members of that committee have been asked to take back the Bill for further consideration. The committee in such case did not feel that any insult was being cast upon it. If we appoint a committee of seven or eight members to do certain work, and that work is not done to the satisfaction to the Senate, there is no reflection on the members of that body in asking them to again consider the matter. </para>

If the committee will not do what we ask them to do, we can appoint another committee to do the work ; or we can deal with it in committee of the whole. The matter is in our own handstand it is beneath the intelligence of honorable senators to suggest that by referring this petition back to the committee we shall be casting reflections upon them. I think that a very strong case has been made but that the petitioner shall be heard, and that the petition shall be inquired into, and I, for one, will at least vote that the matter be referred back for inquiry. </para>

                        <para>- I regret I was not present during the debate which occurred yesterday, because I have not had the advantage of hearing the arguments then adduced for and against the motion submitted by the head of the Government in this Chamber. I recognise, however, that some reflection has been cast upon the Vice-President of the Executive Council for having taken the action he did in regard to the adoption of this report, and I should like to say at once that, when it was a matter for consideration as to what we should do in regard to the report, it appears to me that it was the manifest duty of the leader of the House to take some course of action in order that the matter might be debated fully. It now becomes a question for us to consider whether it is wise, in the interests of the Senate and the administration of our public business, that the -motion submitted by the Vice-President of the Council shall be adopted. J understand it has been plainly stated here that in Western Australia the practice is that a man who has a petition to present must present it within a certain number of days. He must pay a certain deposit, and he has also to see that the petition is referred to the court for "the trial of election petitions. It becomes part of his duty, I 'understand, to move some honorable member of the House to have his petition referred to the court. </para>

                            <para>- I am very pleased to have the explanation. I understand that the usual course after the presentation of a petition is to move a member to have the petition referred to the court in the usual way.Honorable senators in dealing with this question have said that this man did not exactly understand the whole of the "procedure, and possibly overlooked a matter which he did not think it necessary for him to attend to. At the same time we are told that he deliberately adopted the Western Australian practice,asperhaps he was more conversant with it than with any other course of procedure that occurred to his mind. If that be the case, it is very clear that it would become his duty to followup his petition by all the necessary steps, in order to insure its being submitted to the court in proper time for proper consideration. Many honorable senators seem to say that we are doing a dangerous thing, and that we are shutting out the right of petition. We are not shutting out the right of petition - we are recognising the right of petition - but we say that there are other steps which should be taken, and that those steps should primarily be looked after by the petitioner himself. If that be the case, is there any one to blame but the petitioner in this particular instance ? </para>

                            <para>- We talk about the value of keeping our court perfectly pure, and having our procedure carried out in such a way that any man may petition against the right of a senator to represent an electorate. But let us bear this fact in mind, and remember that the man petitioned against is entitled to some consideration, and that his State is entitled to some -consideration. While a petition is presented against the return of a senator, that senator is practically unable to do anything in the ordinary way of attending to his legislative duties. He knows that if it is proved that he has been improperly, elected, -he will be liable to a very heavy penalty for every day upon which he may have voted. </para>

Therefore, as a prudent man, he generally wishes to take no part in the proceedings until the petition against him is dealt with. If we do not adhere to the time condition in every respect we are placing the man petitioned against an this position : He is shut out from voting, and his electorate is deprived of his services in the Senate, because some man has submitted a petition, which may or may not be proved. We must not assume that because -a man says that another is guilty of bribery the charge is proved. </para>

I do not see how we can go back upon what has been done by the committee in this particular respect. I know it may be said that there is too much of technicality in these things very often ; but I find that the head of the Commonwealth Government himself, in the case of a petition against the return of the honorable member for Fremantle to the House of Representatives, took certain action, when the committee there had reported upon the case in these words - </para>

There may be a great distinction between the two conditions in some ways ; but on the other hand I think honorable senators will realize that where time is an element of importance we cannot lightly disregard a requirement of that character. Otherwise we may have petitions hung up over the heads of honorable senators for an indefinite period. We might have a case where a petition would be lodged and no steps taken for some considerable time afterwards, and then, when some very critical matter might be coming on, a course of action might be taken in order to bring it. up for consideration. I do not say that such a thing would take place, but I say there is a possibility of it. </para>

                            <para>- I hope we will create a course of procedure for these cases, but we should always bear in mind that where ' there are requirements we must insist upon their being observed carefully, in order to protect ourselves as well as to protect the public. It may be that this petition, if inquired into,- will be found to be a bag of moonshine. We know that the honorable senator against whom the petition is lodged was returned by a very large majority ; I believe he stood second on the poll, and his majority was nearly 4,000 'or 5,000 beyond the number of votes polled by the man who was sixth on ' the poll. Are we going to say that the probability is that those 5,000 votes were recorded for this man in consequence of the payment of a certain sum of money to a particular association, as alleged in this petition? Surely we are not going to assume such a thing is probable at all ? It is most unfortunate that this matter was not referred, in the very first instance, to a proper tribunal to be dealt with. I do not like the idea myself of a petitioner being knocked out on account of non-compliance with a formality. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure every senator here is animated by only one desire, and that is to do justice both to the petitioner and the sitting member. Having that in view, it appears to me that the motion asks us to take a most unusual course. We had a petition presented to us. charging a sitting member with corruption and bribery, and we referred that petition ta a committee. We constituted, so to speak, a judicial committee, in other words, a. bench of judges, to deal with this question, and now this judicial committee or bench of judges, having delivered its decision, we are asked to reverse that decision. I do  not SaY that it is not in the power of the Senate to reverse the decision, or to send back the report of a committee for further* consideration ; but I do say that it is most unusual, .and it appears tome to be a most improper, course to pursue. Let us assume for the moment that the committee had found the petition was duly lodged, had entered into the consideration of the merits of the petition, had summoned witnesses before it, and had decided against the petitioner. Would the Senate, under those circumstances, be justified in reversing the decision of the committee ? Would it attempt to interfere? If it did it would at once be laying itself open to the charge of permitting cases of this description to degenerate into a mere party struggle. Whether the decision of a committee of this character is regarded as right or as wrong; after it has been deliberately arrived at it should be treated as sacred, and on no consideration should it be interfered with by the Senate. </para>

                            <para>- The Elections and Qualifications Committee is not similar to many other select committees. Supposing that we refer the question of. the federal capital to a select committee, are we necessarily to be bound by its report ? No, a select committee of that character is not a judicial body ; it is merely appointed to obtain information and report. But the Elections and Qualifications Committee, I submit, is a judicial body. </para>

                            <para>- If his signature had not been properly witnessed that would also have been considered a sufficient reason. But this is a much more important reason to my mind that any of them, that not only was the petition not referred to the Senate; within ten days after its lodgment with the Clerk, but so far as I can gather it was not lodged for more than a month after it was left with the Clerk. There appears to be some doubt as to whose duty it was to see that it was referred to the Senate. The person who was most interested ought to have seen that it was referred. Evidently he did not do his duty; he did not exercise sufficient diligence in having the matter brought before this court. We have been told- I do not know whether it is true or false - that he asked several honorable senators to present his petition and that they all refused. If he had done at first what he evidently did at last-that was to approach the leader of the Government here- there would not have been any difficulty in the matter. </para>

                            <para>- I admit .that there is a difference between this Senate and a court of justice. As the honorable and learned senator knows, if a man has sufficient money he can hire a lawyer, and bring any case before a court. .But here it is different; and I think that what the petitioner should have done-: - seeing that there was a time limit in the Western Australian Act - was to bring his case before the leader of the Government, and ask him to set the Senate in motion. He did not do that. I do not know why he did not. I am not inclined to sit in judgment on the committee. We appointed the committee to settle a matter for us, and they have done it. I do not say that we should act illegally, or beyond our powers, but I certainly think we shall be taking a step which will not add to the dignity of the Senate, or be conducive to respect being paid to the decisions of committees of this character, if we refer back the report. I am very sorry that a case of the kind has had to be discussed in this Chamber. In my Opinion all cases of this character should be referred to a tribunal which may be presumed to be entirely impartial. We are supposed to be impartial here, and I hope we are, but at the same time there is no doubt an unconscious party bias which acts, or at least may be presumed to act. That being the case, I think matters of this kind should be referred to a judicial tribunal. </para>

                            <para>- The matter before the Senate was an order of the day, and although the distinction may be drawn by my honorable and learned friend that a motion in respect of an order of the day, was not the order of the day itself, still it was a motion in the form of an instruction to the committee. If the motion was not a moving of the order of- the day - " That the report be adopted," it was an instruction to the committee that they should reconsider their report ; so that it comes under the same category as though it were an order of the day. If you will read Standing Order No. 130, sir, you will' see that it strengthens the position I take up, because it says - </para>

                    <para>So that that shows that the only orders of the day, a debate upon which gives a right of reply, are orders of the day which have been adjourned. This would not be such a case, so that I think clearly if it is, not a direct motion according to the order on the notice paper, it is an amendment to that order, or at all events it is a motion that the committee be instructed to do something. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly. Senator Sir John Downer said he was not going to move it :no one rose to move it. It was a matter of privilege which I was entitled to deal with as leader of the House, and. in reference to that matter, I moved a substantive motion. How can it possibly be said, therefore, that this is a ground for shutting out a reply in such a matter. I submit that there is no ground at all for the point of order. </para>

                            <para>- That is the honorable and learned senator's way of putting it; but I think most people who have heard what has gone on here, and who have heard the honorable and learned senator's attempt to close my mouth, will describe it in a very different way. I am not going to say any more about it. I have my right of reply now, and I hope I shall be able to satisfy the Senate that not only was I right in the course I took in moving this motion, but that there is abundant justification for my statement all through that in taking the charge and conduct of these proceedings - in referring this petition to the House originally - I took the only course open to me as the leader of the Senate-. I do not regret that this debate has taken place, because if it has proved one thing more than another, it has proved that human nature is the same now as it was 130 years ago; when Grenville's Committee Bill was brought into the House of Commons, and when it was almost impossible to prevent a tribunal of this kind from being swayed more or less by party feeling. I give every credit to some honorable senators here for the candid and bold manner in which they have stood out for justice against any claims of party, but there are other honorable senators who have unfortunately allowed themselves to be influenced by the party aspect which has undoubtedly been given both openly and privately to the discussion that has been going on here. Two honorable senators- spoke; and spoke strongly, in favour of my motion. I am rather curious to know whether they are going to vote for that motion. I am rather curious to know whether they are going to substantiate by their votes the opinions they have expressed in the Senate. </para>

Of course they. can. They can also change their vote, although they may not change their opinions. When I find those two honorable and learned senators warmly supporting- the- view that I put before the Senate, then I say that if they are in the Senate, or within the precincts of the Senate, aud refuse to vote, or vote on- the opposite side to their convictions, as expressed, I am justified in contending that there has been a party aspect given to this matter. </para>

Under these circumstances, I found, as I say, in conducting the business of this House that this petition had been properly lodged with the Clerk on the 23rd May. We have had some marvellous mental gymnastics in order to prove whether the court was the Senate, or the Senate was the court, and one honorable senator went so far as to prove, in the most correct form of syllogism, that the Clerk was the court. It was very amusing and very interesting, but I do not think any one has paid much attention to it. </para>

                            <para>- I am reminded by the honorable and learned senator's heated interjection that it was he who made use of the argument. I say that there was no other way by which the petition could be brought before the Senate but by being lodged with the Clerk. Has a petitioner a right to walk in here and put it on the table ? Has he the right to hand it to the President ? What else can he do if he wants to bring his petition before the Senate but hand it to the Clerk ? He did that, and I say that when it was in the hands of the Clerk it was in the hands of the House, which has been constituted by the Constitution the tribunal for considering the petition. </para>

                            <para>- That being so, what was the next step ? There is no doubt that if this petitioner had been able to find some honorable senator to present the petition no question could possibly have been raised as to the mode in which it was placed before the Senate. But we hear that the petitioner went to' two persons, I think it was said, to endeavour to have the petition presented, and they refused to present it. What was his position then ? Was he bound to go round to every one of the 36 members of the Senate in order to get justice ? Was he bound to go cap in hand to every one of them, and would he have lost his right if no honorable senator had been willing to present the petition ? . </para>

                            <para>-It was ; because we were in the position for the first time in the history of Australia of -having to deal with this particular set of facts. There is no doubt that under these unusual circumstances we were obliged to form our own procedure. We were masters of our own procedure, and in whatever position this Senate maybe placed in time to come, I hope there will always be some one in the position of leading the Senate who will 'at all events have the courage to take what he believes to be the "right course, in the interest of the Senate and of the Commonwealth, regardless of whether there is any precedent for it or not. If we are to be bound by precedents - if we are not to move hand or foot unless we can see a precedent in conformity with what is proposed to be done -our progress will be slow and halting indeed in the working out of this Constitution. So much with regard to my action in presenting this petition in the first instance. The matter went to the committee, and the committee brought up their report. It has been already discussed in all its details. When I saw what the report was, and looked into the Western Australian law, I came to this conclusion : that the contention of law upon which that report is founded is so grotesque that I do not believe anything like it exists outside the realms of comic opera. I cannot imagine any lawyer appearing before the most ignorant, stupid bench throughout Australia and having the audacity to put such a proposal before the bench as is involved in what is called the legal question affecting this case. Seeing that, I determined that whatever action might be taken by the Chairman of the Elections and Qualifications Committee, so far as I was concerned, I would see that there was not left upon the records of this Senate such a blot upon its intelligence and fair dealing, in connexion with the right of petition, as would be implied by the adoption of the report. I have used what may be considered strong language, and I shall justify it. There is no use in mincing matters. I have a very strong opinion about the decision of the committee; and I shall now state very particularly my reasons for that opinion. It is said - it has been admitted - that the procedure of the Western Australian law would have nothing to do with this matter but for the action of the petitioner himself. To make that perfectly obvious to any honorable senator who has not studied the Act for himself, I should like to point out that the two sections of the Western Australian Act - 146 and 147 - relate to taking a petition before the court of disputed returns in Western Australia, and have no relation to anything else. </para>

                            <para>- No ; Wednesday week was the day on which I postponed it, in order to suit the convenience of the honorable and learned senator. The occasion on which the Chairman of the Elections and Qualifications Committee informed me - and the only occasion on which he informed me - that he was not going to move in the matter was on the very afternoon on which the motion was actually moved. Therefore I say that in these circumstances my position was this : I had already taken occasion to see that the petition was brought before the Senate. I found that a report had come back from the committee, which was such that I thought the Senate on every ground ought not to agree with it. I found chat the honorable and learned senator, who was in charge of the report, was not going to make any motion in regard to it. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether we had such a power or not. It may be that the Senate has to decide it. The principle may be right. It may not be, perhaps, in the power of the Senate to hand over its functions absolutely and without recall to a committee. I do not wish to express any opinion on that point at all. The course which the Senate took was that it did not put the committee in any such position, but it put it in the position of inquiring and reporting. I do not care who the members of the committee are ; I do not care how eminent or how learned they are ; they are only members of the committee of this House, and their duties are only to inquire and report. What they do is subject to the approval or disapproval of the Senate, and it does seem to me that it is taking up an attitude which I might describe, I hope without offence, as altogether too petulant to be indulged in, to assume that because the Senate does not approve of the report that therefore the committee is to talk of resigning. 1 say that the Senate will not submit to dictation upon those grounds. The committee has a certain duty put upon it. It has to inquire and report, and it must be recognised that its position is only the position of inquiring and reporting. If the Senate thinks fit to refuse to accept the committee's report, I hope they will take that action without any suggestion that there is an insult or any flouting of the committee intended. It must be obvious that if an attitude of that sort were assumed by the committee, we should be in the extraordinary position that the business of the House would be deputed to committees over whose decisions we should lose control, and we would gradually give away our powers and duties to be performed by deputy. 1 do not think there is any question at all about the position which the committee ought to assume.

                        <para>In all the Legislative Assemblies of the United States, therefore, except those in which the subject is particularly regulated by law, questions relating to the rights of membership are consequently to be investigated and determined in the ordinary course of proceeding. Two methods only appear to be in use, namely : first, a trial at the bar of the Assembly, in which the case is investigated directly, and decided upon by the Assembly itself ; and second, a preliminary investigation by a committee, and a final determination by the Assembly on their report. These modes of proceeding will be explained hereafter. When the latter mode is pursued, it is the duty of the committee to report and state the particulars of the proof, as well as their conclusion thereupon ; the House not being concluded by the opinion of the committee in matter of fact, any more than in matter of law. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit that there was nothing sinister about it, and I hope that there never will be in connexion "with what is done in this House. Although my friends are sitting on the left, I am certain there is nothing sinister about anything they do. I hope the Senate will come to a conclusion upon this matter without party bias or party feeling, but upon the consideration only of what is right in the interests of the petitioner and of the sitting senator, and what is right also in the interests of the State of Western Australia, which is entitled to have her representative here in accordance with the law of Western Australia as it regulates elections in that State. If the law has been violated, then the honorable senator who sits here has no right to do so. If it has not been violated then no one will be more pleased than myself to see that the cloud is removed from the title of that honorable senator to sit here. Whichever it is, I hope we will remember that we have no right to take up the position of defending by every technicality the seats of every honorable senator here, when the Senate is the court itself to try the validity of those seats. It would indeed be a bad thing for the influence of this House, it would indeed be a sorry day for the Constitution, if ever it came to be said that in our early days of exercising the power which the Constitution has given us, we tortured and twisted the law in order to protect one of ourselves from the exercise against him of that right of petition which is given by the Constitution. </para>

Some suggestions were made as to paragraph (b), to which I would like to allude. The Senate will remember that this is the clause dealing with the mode of payment of compensation to a State. The clause provides that compensation shall be payable to a State in respect of any land acquired under the Bill, and an option is given to the Governor-General to pay the compensation in these three way's : - </para>

If in a good many instances they have borrowed for the construction of their public works at a higher rate of interest than they can get from the Commonwealth, we cannot help it. I think it very likely that the provision referred to will not be very much used. It is much more likely that the next alternative will be the one to be adopted, with an amendment.

                    <para>- I had not the advantage of being present when this Bill was introduced, and possibly the question I propose now to ask may have been answered at the time. I would like to know from the Vice-President of the Executive Council whether the Governments of the various States have been approached, and their opinion obtained with regard to this matter of payment of compensation, because it is a matter that already, I believe, affects values considerably in excess of £10,000,000.

                        <para>- Then I understand that the various "Governments have not been approached, and I think I may understand further, that the Government is not in a position to give an expression of opinion from any of the State Governments, lt therefore becomes necessary for us to bo very careful in this matter. As the clause is worded, it is to be entirely at the option of the Governor-General as to which of the methods of payment mentioned here is to be adopted. I can quite see that it might be objectionable to erase " Governor-General "and insert "the States, " but there are objections on either side. I have been' thinking the matter over, and I would make this suggestion without at present undertaking to move an amendment : I suggest to the representative of the Government that at the end of this clause a proviso be inserted allowing the State to appeal to the Supreme Court if it feels that the method of payment proposed by the Commonwealth involves any injustice to it. We can all see it is an element of unfairness to leave it to the Commonwealth to decide the mode of payment. </para>

                        <para>- The average rate of interest paid by the various States, according to a rough calculation I have made, is between 31/2 and 4 per cent. It would be manifestly unfair if the Government took over works for which the States are paying interest on the money borrowed at 31/2 or 4 per cent., and only paid the States 3 per cent. on account of them. If this clause is allowed to go as it stands, the Commonwealth Government will be in the position of saying to the States, " We will give you 3 per cent. debentures," and while the Commonwealth Government is paying the 3 percent., the States will be paying to their creditors in London 31/4 or 31/2 or 4 per cent. for the money borrowed in respect of the services transferred. That would not be just to the various States. I certainly think that if paragraph (b) cannot be deleted from clause 44, we should adopt SenatorPlayford's suggestion that the rate of interest on the debentures be 31/2 per cent. Even at 31/2 per cent. we should not, in my opinion, be paying the rate of interest that the States are paying for the money they borrowed to institute the various services which have been transferred to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The difficulty is this : The money borrowed was at 4, 5, or 6 per cent. ; but it was not borrowed specifically for any particular work taken over by the Commonwealth. It was simply borrowed by the State as part of its financial operations upon its credit generally ; and why, when the Commonwealth takes over any particular work, should the Commonwealth be bound to credit the State with a rate of interest equivalent to the rate paid by the State generally on its indebted; ness ? </para>

                <para>SenatorSTANIFORTH SMITH. - I have not a great knowledge of parliamentary procedure, but I understand that when the Treasurer brings forward a proposal for a loan, he states the works upon which the money is to be spent ; and it could be ascertained from the records of the States how much money has been devoted to a particular purpose. There are, no doubt, difficulties as to the rate to be paid. If we take the case of the Western Australian railways, a sum of £9,000,000 has been borrowed on account of them, and it would be very difficult to strike a rate of interest that would be exactly equal to the rate paid on account of the various loans that were floated at different rates of interest for the construction of those lines. But this difficulty would be got over if we said that if the rates of interest averaged 31/2 per cent. on money borrowed we would give the State debentures, not at 3 but at 31/2 per cent. That would come as. near to a just compromise as we could get. If paragraph (b) were struck out altogether, we should then have two ways in which the option of the Commonwealth could be exercised - one to pay cash, and the other to relieve the States of loans to the extent of the services taken over. Therefore, I do not think the Commonwealth would be in a bad position. If what I suggest cannot be done, however, I shall support the proposal that the rate of interest be 31/2 per cent. </para>

                    <para>- This is undoubtedly one of the most important clauses in the Bill. Personally, I have a decided objection to both paragraphs (a) and  (b), for the reason that they will place in the hands of the States practically the power of raising what is equal to a new loan. We know perfectly well that if the Commonwealth pays cash to a State the money will soon disappear, no matter what Ministry is in power. </para>

It would place in the hands of the States a number of debentures which they could sell in the market whenever they liked. It seems to me that if we can keep the States practically in the same position as they are in now, that is all that is wanted ; and I believe that that can safely be done. At present each State has a number of what I may call dead assets, in the shape of post-offices, forts, harbor works, and so forth, out of which it cannot make money; and if the </para>

                        <para>- That is a sad omission on the part of Victoria. In South Australia we are able to tell what we have borrowed for - for railways, or waterworks, or for construction of buildings, or the erection of post-offices, or any other purpose. We can fix the line in the Loan Bill,' and show the particular amount there, and also the statement made by the South Australian Government to investors in 'London when we borrowed the money there. We said that we wanted so much for each particular, work. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposal contained in paragraph (b) to make payment by debentures seems to me to be a singularly clumsy method of public finance. It is uncommonly like paying your creditors with an I O U. It is not a desirable position for the Commonwealth Government to occupy - a Government supposed to be of much dignity - to be offering promissory notes in payment for property taken over. The Commonwealth should be in the position to pay cash, or take over the responsibility - and the latter by way of preference - if we can get over the rate of interest difficulty. . I think it would be very much better to adopt the proposal made last week in reference to paragraph (b), if we are to retain it, and that instead of allotting to the State debentures or stock of the Commonwealth at face value of the amount of such compensation, we should take the market value at the date of allotment. That would not be a very difficult thing to arrive at, and it would certainly be fairer than compelling the State to take the stock at its face value at a time when it might be at a heavy discount. Circumstances might compel the transfer of property at any time. We cannot tell what is before us. We must transact this business within a reasonable time, but we do not know what national complications may arise to cause the stock of any country, not alone the stock of a new Government such as this, to depreciate very materially. I am sure honorable senators can remember an occasion when what was one of the principal Australian colonies at the time proposed a loan of £1,000,000. or £2,000,000, bearing interest at 5 per cent., and the selling price to be £85. That is an actual historical fact. </para>

                        <para>- I would like the honorable senator, who is very facetious at times, to tell me when in this State, it was not so. It is all very well to make general statements and, as we say, to swear at large, but perhaps the honorable senator will say when it was not so in Victoria ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that they ever paid £50 an acre for such land, and having lived in this State of Victoria since 1852, I should know .something of it if it took place- Perhaps the honorable senator will say where this extraordinary procedure took place, and no doubt the information he will give to the public will prove to be a great check upon such public peculation. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to interfere with the honorable and learned senator in charge of. the Bill. The point is as to whether there is to be an option or not. If my view is carried out there will be no option and no necessity for leaving those words in. It will be absolutely mandatory that if assets are taken from the States at the same time debts to the same amount will have to be taken over. It appears to me that we could save time by taking the sense of the committee upon this amendment. </para>

I thoroughly agree that that is the principle ; and I should think it would be quite sufficient to leave in paragraph (c), because then, upon these particular assets being taken over, there would be a transfer of so much of the debts of the States to the Commonwealth as would be a payment to the States for the assets taken over, in accordance with the value agreed upon. But paragraph (c) leaves the matter somewhat indeterminate; because, while providing that the payment may be made by relieving the State of the amount of principal and interest of the debt of the State, it does not say what debt the Commonwealth shall take over. "We know that in every State the debts are of varying terms, and at varying rates of interest. The public debts of the States depend as much perhaps for their value on the time they have to run as upon the security and the rate of interest. </para>

I think that in the interests of the States we should object to the Government paying cash, because it seems to me absolutely irrefutable that the Treasurer of the Commonwealth will desire to float a loan at a lower rate of interest, and pay cash, instead of taking over an equivalent amount of loans from the States, which would in all probability bear a higher rate of interest. The Commonwealth Government would only be. acting according to commercial principles in doing so. If we allow this paragraph to pass it will be giving the Commonwealth an. unfair advantage over the States, and it will only benefit the latter in the unlikely combination of circumstances that, just at the moment when the States want to start public works, the Commonwealth Government will be in a position to give them a certain sum of money. . </para>

                        <para>- He may have been referring to that paragraph, but it comes to the same thing, because somebody else has used the argument. It really amounts to this, that we shall have regard not only to the amount of compensation and fair interest upon that, but that we should if possible try to give back to the State more than 3 per cent., because the State itself is paying more than 3 per cent, on money it has borrowed. What is the position of the case when we dealt with private property in another part of the Bill ? In arriving at a decision as to the amount of interest to be allowed we agreed to allow a' private individual 3 per cent, on his compensation. There was a long discussion about that and a division, and the House by a majority decided that 3 per cent, was to be allowed to the individual. </para>

                        <para>- There could not be, because, as the honorable and learned senator sees, this is the first occasion upon which anybody of this sort has had to deal with a State. Dealing with individuals is a very different matter. What I am pointing out is that if we deal with this question on the basis of a deferred payment of money, and that is what it is, we should settle the amount of interest on precisely the same principle as if we were dealing with an individual. When it is said that we must have regard to the amount of interest which a State is paying upon its debts, I say we cannot have regard to that. A State borrows on its credit generally. In South Australia, apparently, they can earmark a loan in respect of particular works, but in most of the States that cannot be done, and it is simply a loan on the general credit. In regard to some of these loans the State may be paying 5 per cent., and in regard to others 4 per cent, and 31/2 per cent. What connexion can there possibly be between the amount a State is paying upon its general indebtedness and the amount we are to allow the State as interest upon its compensation? It would be exactly the same principle as if in dealing with some individual who borrowed money on his general credit at 4, 5, or 6 per cent., when we' took his property from him we should allow him compensation, and that the interest allowed him on the compensation should be fixed by a consideration of the interest he is paying on the rest of his indebtedness. It must be clear to honorable senators that such a thing as that cannot be allowed to enter into the question at all. The only question to be considered is what is the fair interest to allow, taking the debentures as simply a deferred method of payment. Three per cent. is the amount fixed by the clause, and it is a fair amount for one reason, and that is that I think it may be taken to be about the rate at which the Commonwealth loans will be floated.In addition to that we know that if a State to-day has money, £4,000, £5,000, £10,000, or £20,000 in hand, and wants an investment for it, the best investment it could get would not make more than 3 per cent., and when we are paying compensation, not in cash, but by a deferred payment for four, five, or ten years, why should the State be put in a better position than it would be if it had the amount in cash and could invest it in the open market ? </para>

The Commonwealth can raise the money at 3 per cent. Therefore the Commonwealth certainly will raise the money and pay cash if it is compelled to pay a rate of interest which is considerably higher than 3 per cent. The various States will no doubt be very anxious that the operation most profitable to them shall" be adopted, that is to say, that a proportion of their debts shall be taken over at the average rate of interest. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Any financial expert can always tell the value of these debts. The advantage of leaving the clause in this wide way is that it enables the Commonwealth to take over the debts that it may be desirable to take over first. If it is a debt in respect of which there are short dated debentures at a high rate of interest, the state would be anxious to get rid of it. We want to be able to take over debts becoming due at an early date, so that the Commonwealth Government may, if they see fit, operate themselves, and substitute their own for these debentures.. </para>
