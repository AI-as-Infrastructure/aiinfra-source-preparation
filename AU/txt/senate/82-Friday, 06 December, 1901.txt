                        <para>- The adjournment which the Senate makes over Christmas docs not necessarily indicate the time' of the adjournment of another place. , The two Houses need npt necessarily act identically in that respect. The present intention of the Government is that the Senate shall adjourn on the 13th or 14th December. It may be necessary to ask the Senate to sit on Saturday if we cannot finish the business before us next Friday. Then we propose to meet again on the 15 th January. That arrangement is of course subject to the exigencies of public business/ That is to say, I do not bind myself in any way to that date. For instance, should the Tariff be passed by the House of Representatives before Christmas, it might possibly become necessary for the Senate to meet earlier. I cannot say anything more at present. </para>

                        <para>- I .hardly think that it is proper for an honorable senator to bring forward, by way of personal explanation, statements made in a newspaper, which ho thinks has misrepresented his action. If that is permitted, we shall have any number of statements made in the Senate by different honorable senators concerning what has been said in the newspapers all over the Commonwealth as to their action. I do not think that we ought to take any notice of newspaper comments. </para>

I have learnt since yesterday that it has been the practice in the State Parliament to take down the curtains at the sides of the chamber directly the warm weather commenced. I am informed that to do so will greatly increase the ventilation. I propose to take action to have the curtains removed. </para>

If they are to have control of the business of the Senate, it will be quite apparent that they cannot be expected to give reasons for the arrangement of business in any particular matter. Therefore, although I will answer the honorable senator's question on this occasion, I do not think it is one of those matters with which the Senate generally has much to do, unless it is a matter which really concerns some particular piece of business. </para>

                        <para>- I do not want them to come here, but at the same time I think we must really have regard to the well-being of the Empire on this question. The honorable senator should remember that there is a Secretary of State for India in the Imperial Parliament. Our Indian fellow-subjects have fought for us and died for us. The black men from India were the first to enter the legations in Pekin, and the white women there put their arms round them, and. thanked them for delivering them. We cannot have India as a part of the Empire, and yet treat its inhabitants in the way proposed here. </para>

                    <para>- I take it that the object of the honorable senator is to carry out the views expressed by himself and others, including Senators Macfarlane and Neild. Their objection to the Bill is that it does not follow the Natal Act, and I understand that those honorable senators are prepared to support a clause which will follow the Natal Act. I remind the honorable senator that there is one feature of the Natal Act which in Natal and elsewhere makes it obviously and admittedly ineffective, and that is that words of the test are contained in the schedule to the Act so that any one may learn them off. If the honorable senator is prepared to leave the form of words to be submitted to the discretion of the officer by omitting the words " set out in the schedule" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word " prescribed,"I shall be disposed to accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I shall oppose the amendment. The power, no doubt, always exists in the Government to shut out, according to their discretion, any person who they think ought not to be a member of the community. But it seems to me that it would be giving too great a power altogether to leave it entirely to the discretion of a Government to say who should or should not be proclaimed prohibited immigrants. If there is to be a law regulating these admissions, there ought to be a provision in it much more definite than that. </para>

                    <para>- This paragraph is, strictly speaking, foreign to the object of the Bill, which has been introduced to insure a white Australia. The paragraph raises the question of the engagement, not of coloured races, but of labour of other kinds,, whether from the old country or otherwise. Whatever may be the desirability of granting such power to the Minister as this Bill provides, this is not the measure in which it ought to be introduced. The paragraph opens up a very large question which has not yet been dealt with in any one State. It practically means that Australia is to be kept, as far as manual labour is concerned, entirely for those who are already in the country, subject to the consent of the Minister of the day to the introduction of skilled labour. I do not think that such a provision is in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole, and I am certain that it is not in the interests of the labourers of Australia. At the time when there was a steady stream of immigration into 'Victoria, at the rate of 1,000 a week, we were paying 17s. 6d. a day for manual labour. In those days there was a continuous immigration to the goldfields. It is in the interests of the working classes themselves that there should be a stream of immigration into the country. Such a paragraph as this is, -so far as I know, contrary to the wishes of the general public, and the question it deals with certainly was not mooted in Victoria at the Commonwealth elections. It will allow the Minister to stifle industries that may require the importation of specially skilled men, and the consequence will be that capital that might profitably be employed in developing industries will be unable to be so utilized. I feel strongly on the subject ; not that it will affect me personally, but because I feel sure that it will injure those whom it is intended to protect. </para>

                    <para>- I remember the .time when domestic servants were imported into Queensland at the instance of the Government, and there was such an inquiry for them that they were rushed by ladies who wished to engage them! That shows that there is a great demand for this class of manual labour. It would be monstrous to prohibit any one from engaging a few domestic servants abroad if he wished to do so. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot allow the paragraph to pass without making a protest against it. What Australia needs most is more population. There may be a surplus population here and there. There might be a surplus of labour for a time, but I am certain that the one great need of Australia is a greater population, . which would help to lighten the burdens that rest at present on the shoulders of the three or four millions of inhabitants of the Commonwealth. I do not apprehend that there is any danger of the wages rate in Australia suffering from the bringing in of new labourers. It rarely happens that labourers are introduced into Australia from Europe under the conditions hinted at in this provision, and I see no reason why it should be inserted. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. At first they took contracts for supplying the mines and mills with firewood at very low rates. But as -soon as they established themselves upon a sound footing, they fell into line with the conditions that had prevailed before their arrival in the State, and did not take contracts at rates lower than those at -which others were prepared to accept them. For a considerable time, however, the Queensland workman suffered severely, and I hope no action on the part of the Senate will bring about such a state of affairs again. </para>

                    <para>- We need not go to South Australia for an example because we have one in the State of Victoria. Some honorable senators will remember that Cornish and Bruce imported 100 Italian immigrants in connexion with the contract for the Mount Alexander line, . under a contract to work for more than eight hours a day, and at less than the rate of wages which was considered reasonable. It turned out a failure, because the Italians did not adhere to the agreement made with them in Italy for about half the rate of pay which was current here at the time. An. attempt was made to get over the difficulty by substituting a lot of brick-work for stonework, because the masons caused a lot of trouble to the contractors, and worked under the eight hours system. Cornish and Bruce looked upon it as their right to import men at any price at which they could get them, and at the time I speak of masons' wages here were from 1 5s. to 1 6s. a day. </para>

                        <para>- The word means that a man has made his home in a country. If a man brings his wife and children here, and lives in this country, and has given up his other home, then he is domiciled here, and that may take place in a week or a month. Of course it may be a question of evidence whether a man has become domiciled in the country. If a man has a home in England, and he leaves his wife there and comes out here and establishes another home, it may be that he is not domiciled, but surely it may be left to the Government to decide under the particular circumstances whether a person is domiciled or not. What &lt;io we aim at here? We aim at reaching those persons who have actually made their homes among us. That is a perfectly simple thing to decide. There is no reason why an officer should not decide it. </para>

                    <para>- It seems that there is some little misconception as to what this paragraph is intended for. This is an exception. The previous paragraph deals with prohibited persons, but there are certain classes of persons who, when they come here even if in other respects, they might be within the prohibited class, are not so if they can satisfy the new conditions. One of these conditions is that if a man has been domiciled in Australia either through having been a native of it, or having had his home here for a number of years has gone away and has returned, he is to be admitted, as a matter of course, as he ought to be. It seems to me that the paragraph is perfectly clear, and is intended to except a class of persons who would otherwise be prohibited. </para>

                        <para>- It may be remembered that when this Bill was first taken into committee the question was raised of whether clause 3 was in the proper, form. After consideration, it appears to me that it would be better to omit the clause, which it will be seen, refers to this first schedule. If the clause is omitted, this schedule must go. The position would thus be left in the way in which the Constitution operates. I move - </para>

                        <para>- Apparently those Acts cannot be administered to cope with this great evil. Municipal councils have appointed officers to administer the Health Acts, but find it  impossible to deal with the Hindoos and the Chinese. I desire to compel these aliens to pay something towards the government of the country, and I think that the proposition that they shall pay a tax of £5 per annum is a very reasonable one. I noticed in a Brisbane paper the other day a paragraph, setting forth that hordes of Hindoos, Chinamen, and other Asiatics are concentrating in the northern portion of Queensland. The paragraph stated that the Premier of Queensland, when interviewed on the question, said that the Government had official intimation that such was the case, and that he had no doubt that these aliens were being brought into the north of Queensland to meet the kanaka legislation of the Federal Parliament - to supply the places of the kanakas who will be deported in course of time. These Hindoos and Chinamen will compete with our workers in many ways, and I am anxious that we shall not make their stay in the Commonwealth too rosy. If we can, by the imposition of a tax, prompt them to leave the country, I think we ought to do so. I have proposed that the tax shall be £5 per annum, because I think that is a fair compromise. Personally, I should like to make it £20. There may be something in the contention that those who have already paid a poll tax of £100 should have some special consideration, and I am quite willing that they should. </para>

                        <para>- I must oppose this amendment. It goes altogether beyond the necessities of this measure. This Bill is to regulate immigration, and it seems to me that it would be a verv unnecessary and harsh proceeding to place under special disabilities aliens who are already in the Commonwealth. If it is found that, in carrying on the business of the Commonwealth, it is necessary to make special laws dealing with any particular class of coloured aliens, there will be power to do so under sub-section (26) of section 51 of the Constitution. That, however, should be done only by some special Bill, and not by a side wind. </para>

Seeing that honorable senators in opposition have declared that they are opposed to this Bill, because it is too stringent and is altogether prohibitive, I certainly have a right to be satisfied, and consequently during the rest of the consideration of this Bill I am going to do all I can to support the Government in carrying out the provision which honorable senators in opposition have declared to be too stringent, and which they, have two or three times made an effort to make less effective as a means of preventing aliens and ail other objectionable immigrants from coining into the Commonwealth. That they think it is too stringent is warrant enough for me to support this amendment, knowing that according to them it will carry out the provision I desire to see inserted. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator has not been fooled,, except by a catch vote, which reflects credit on the astuteness of the Government. In this matter I have not been actuated by. party principles at all. I have honestly expressed my views. I supported the Government in connexion with the Kanaka Bill, and I came here pledged to absolute exclusion. I promised the electors of Western Australia that I would not vote for any legislation that would leave a loophole. </para>

Under this proposal an alien may come here who can speak three or four languages, and because he may not be able to speak the language selected as the test in his case he may be excluded. The object is plainly to exclude a person on account of the colour of his skin. </para>

They found that it was likely to embarrass the Government, and therefore it was not their intention to proceed with the amendment to a final issue if it could be avoided by any pretence. I should not have been surprised if the amendment had not even been submitted. </para>

                        <para>- That has been a matter of argument. It has been put to them, but they have not been satisfied with it. Why should we not deal with this matter honestly ? If we desire to deal with a particular class of aliens, should we not do so straightforwardly, and not place a fraud upon the statute-book ? My action upon this matter has been consistent from the first. Ever since I have been in politics I have followed one line of action, which may have , been right or wrong, but which at all events has been con-consistent. When honorable senators say they want a thing, they should be prepared to stand up for their so-called principles, and do what they say they intend to do. I shall watch with a considerable amount of curiosity the result of the vote upon this question. </para>

                <para>SenatorSir JOSIAH SYMON.- What right has the labour party to bring forward this petty pretext for the abandonment of their principles ? If they had stood up and said - " We have changed our mind; we do not care two pence for securing a white Australia by means of a policy of direct exclusion, and we have thrown aside this majority of 15 to 9," none of us would have a right to complain. A man has a right to change his mind, but what I complain of is the apparent subterfuge. The fever has been catching, and seems to have taken possession of honorable senators. I was afraid it would after what happened last night. I was present, and can corroborate what has been said by another honorable senator, that there was no voice from the labour corner calling for a division. They were going to let the question go on the voices. That shows the absolute sham ! Who have been betrayed? Those who voted with the labour party upon this, and who are prepared and intend to vote again upon the same question. </para>

                    <para>- I am sure we are very much obliged to the honorable and learned senator for the excellent lesson he has given us as to the necessity of party organization, but I should like him to apply the lesson to his own party. If he had done so the position would not be what it is at present. </para>

                        <para>- That is just the reason why the labour party do not feel safe in going any further. There Ls too much of this kind of offer - "We think so and so will vote with you." When we moved the amendment honorable senators were found voting against it, and other honorable senators whose votes we were led to believe we would get were absent. Can honorable senators wonder that, having been defeated once with such support, we decline to risk a similar defeat again. I remind the committee that there has been a debate during this last week, which has been very ominous. The labour party have been supporting the Government in an effort to rid Australia of a large number of people of a coloured race, and on which side have honorable senators been in that discussion, who are now so anxious to take the extreme step of complete exclusion to which the labour party is pledged ? They have been most severe in their criticism of the attitude the labour party have taken up upon that question, and yet they are the men who led the movement for an extension of time for the planters in Queensland. That is a significant incident in the week's proceedings, and should be sufficient to make us pause before we again walk into the spider's web. If any one is responsible for the present position it is the free-trade party, and their lack of organization, and their lack of loyalty to their leaders. </para>
