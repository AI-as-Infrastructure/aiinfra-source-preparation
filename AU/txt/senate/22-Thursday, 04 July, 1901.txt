                        <para>- And in all those cases the method of retirement appears on the face of the Constitution itself. It is to be understood that the election of a man carries with it his right to remain for a longer or shorter period, according to his place upon the poll. I merely mention these matters with the view of showing that in whatever way we look at the matter it is not without precedent and example. Really we hav.e to decide, after the best consideration that can be brought to bear, which is the method for the Senate to adopt. After some fluctuation of opinion the Government has thought that the better plan to submit for the indorsement of the Senate would be that which is embodied in this motion. It provides that there shall be prepared a roll of the senators for each State. The names of the senators returned by the greatest number of votes shall be placed first upon the roll. The names of the senators elected by the next greatest number of votes shall be placed second, and so on, by rotation. The senators whose names are placed first, second, and third on the roll shall be senators of the second class; and those whose names are placed fourth, fifth, and sixth on the roll shall be senators of the first class. That plan insures that the senators lowest on the poll in each State - that is, the senators described in this motion as of the first class - shall retire within three years, and the senators of the second class at the end of six years. It appears to the Government that taking everything into consideration, that method is the fairest and the most obvious way of arranging the division which has to take effect under section 13 of the Constitution. The matter is important in this sense : that it is necessary that the Senate shall come to a conclusion as early as possible, because in the event of any vacancy occurring, the person who is elected will be returned for the remainder of the term of the senator whose seat has been vacated. I can understand a difficult question arising if a vacancy should occur before this question is settled. That makes it important in point of time. But it is also important to individual senators and to the States who have- sent them here that the fairest and best method of arriving at a division shall be come to by the Senate. </para>

                    <para>- I entirely agree with the motion. I think in all the circumstances it provides the proper way of settling the term for which senators shall hold office. It appears to me that those senators who received the highest number of votes for the time, at any rate, enjoy the confidence of the electors in a greater degree than those who polled the lesser number. There is one matter, however, in connexion with this motion about which I am not quite clear. Am I to understand that if a senator of the second class were to die, his successor would hold office for the period of six years 1 </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it is quite likely. Everything is possible in a democracy, even that it should save itself. Therefore I think it is well to point out that I do not consider the Senate should quote this motion as a precedent which shall for all time govern the election of senators if proportional voting is adopted. I regret that the returns relating to the Tasmanian election, which I asked for recently, have not yet ni rived, because if they were here I should be able to point out to honorable senators what an intricate matter the election of senators under the Hare system is. Under that system it is quite possible for a senator to be sixth on the poll, and yet the man placed seventh or eighth on the list might be the choice of the general body of electors if it were a run. between two of them. </para>

                        <para>- I would remind the Senate that I commenced my speech by saying that the principle of proportional voting was that minorities should be represented'. "What I wish to show is that the Hare system tries to give each section of the people the exact proportion of representation to which it is entitled, having regard to its strength. If every member of one particular class or way of thinking were to join together and vote No. 1 for a certain man, it is quite certain that he would get one of the six places, whilst the seventh, eighth, or ninth man might, if there was a race between four of them, each defeat the successful candidate. </para>

                        <para>- Tt is not a bad argument. It is the system that my honorable friend does not understand, and it is owing to a want of knowledge of that system that the electors in other parts of the Common wealth do not adopt it. If it does not do what I claim for it, then it lacks the very principle for which people support it. It has the effect of allowing a section of the community to put in one of the six senators,, whereas if you eliminated the other live and. left the sixth man to run against the seventh, eighth, or ninth man, he would be defeated.. Therefore, the Hare system comes in, and says it is just and equitable that those who voted for No. 6 should get him in, because in proportion to their strength, as compared with other classes of the community, they are entitled to one senator. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion, but I think it would be hardly a fair principle at all times1 to apply to the election of senators if the Hare system obtains. </para>

                    <para>- I rise, not to oppose the motion,, but to oppose the proposition that the poll recently taken for the Senate shows that the confidence of the people necessarily rests in a higher degree in some .of the successful candidates than in others. It will be seen that this cannot be the case, when we have regard to the fact that in no two States were the elections conducted under similar lines or like conditions. For instance, in West Australia plumping was permitted. In Tasmania, the electors could plump for three candidates. In New South Wales, plumping was prohibited. I do not know what system was adopted in the other States ; but it is sufficient for my purpose that in three of the States the conditions of election were wholly dissimilar in regard to this point. There were other dissimilarities. In Tasmania, for- . example, there was a double vote - I refer to the Hare system - by which results were obtained which could be secured in no other State. Another point to be considered is, that in some of the States a deposit was necessary, and that tended to reduce the number of candidates. In New South Wales we had the extraordinary spectacle of no less than 50 candidates standing for the six seats. In no two States were the conditions of election sufficiently similar to warrant, in my estimation, any hard-and-fast line being followed in determining what was1 the order of the public choice. It has already been shown to the Senate that in New South Wales there were no less than 39,000 informal votes, due no doubt- very largely to the extraordinary number of candidates. The names on the ballot-papers were printed so closely together - that it was hardly possible to scratch out one without running the risk of scratching out another. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>It may be said, as I said, " This is a great bungle. Why were the names not printed further apart?" The difficulty, I have ascertained, was that if the size of the ballot-papers had been increased, it would have necessitated the manufacture of 2,200 ballot-boxes. If the ballot-papers had been enlarged, larger boxes would have been necessary for holding them. I simply point this matter out in order to show that the great number of informal papers was due, not so much to ignorance, as to the exceptional conditions. Each of these 39,000 ballot papers was representative of six votes, so that we had something approaching a quarter of ' a million of wasted votes in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- It is quite possible, but in view of the fact that, with 50 candidates, and these extraordinary number of informal votes, only 9,000 votes separated the first from the sixth on the poll, I think it is very hard to say what was the intention of the electors in placing them in that order. A very few of these informal ballot-papers would, if counted, have made a great difference. The motion, therefore, I think, is rather a rough and ready adjustment of the difficulty than an actual proposition that it is a method absolutely just and positively equitable. I give it my support merely as a matter of convenience, and not as a matter of equity, or as clearly indicating the will of the people. </para>

                        <para>- It is- left entirely open. 'That, however, is a matter which honorable senators- can consider in detail in committee. So far, 'I have spoken about ascertainment of 'compensation,- particularly in cases -where 'individuals or corporations, and the Commonwealth are concerned. But there is a special provision in this Bill dealing, -necessarily 'for the first "time, with cases in -which -a State is a party. Those cases are dealt -with on this principle : Where the State owns Grown lands, it is dealt' with 'as the owner of the freehold, exactly in the same way as-any other owner of ' freehold ' is dealt with. But there' is a special- provision which will set at rest, I think, in a proper- way, a suggestion which is -sometimes made in public, that where land, the property of a" State, is taken for Commonwealth purposes, the "State is to be entitled not only to the value of the land," but also to -some compensation for loss of the rights of -revenue, and of taxation- over that land. It is expressly provided in this -Bill that no such light will be given. Clause 43 says the State shall not be entitled to compensation in respect of the loss of any rights of dominion, taxation, or any other rights that arise from the fact of its being the governing power over the resumed land. Of course, that clause may have a very important application. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and it seems* to me that that is 'eminently reasonable. Because it will be very difficult to estimate the value of the taxation rights and what value to assign to its right of dominion. Besides,- the whole purpose .and scope of this federation is- that where land is required for the purposes of the Commonwealth it. shall he - given- to the central authority, and with no other recognition of rights than, the ordinary rights of -ownership, gives to any - individual. I think I have dealt with all the important matters. There are a number of . clauses- which are taken up with the details of the ascertainment qf title. The Government will not, and are not bound to, pay over compensation until they have satisfied themselves 'as to the titles of the different claimants.- A&gt; number of provisions deal with cases- of that kind, and also with the payment of compensation to different classes of interests. There are other provisions - regarding_costs, giving compulsory powers to- enter upon land and to view it,- and compulsory powers of taking possession. In other words; there is all the usual and- necessary machinery to carry into effect the principles to which I have alluded. I think it "will be found by honorable senators who- go through the Bill that it has been carefully prepared, and is calculated to give the fullest- powers to the Government for the purpose, of acquiring, all property which may be necessary for the public .purposes of the Commonwealth ; whilst, at the same time, good care- is -taken that not only the interests of the States, involved, but the interests of. the individuals- concerned,. are fairly and justly dealt with. </para>

                        <para>- But there is no provision for it here. I do not suppose that there will be any officers deserving of the designation of "Jack's in office " under the Commonwealth ; but we know that there has been a great deal of arrogance in regard to the taking of men's lands when railway engineers and other officials have been anxious to get on with a certain work. There is no doubt that the authorities would have to take possession, but it would be a little trying to a landowner to have his first intimation that his land was taken from him for the purposes of the Commonwealth by means of an invasion by a lot of navvies. </para>

                        <para>- It is more than that. We assess the value of the land, and we add on 10 per cent, for the compulsory taking. That is the equivalent which is always allowed to a man for being forced to part with his property against his will. But the rest of clause 17 adopts a very excellent rule, so as to prevent an increment arising from 'the improvement occasioned by the construction of the works, and the set-off is adopting the modern system of " betterment." That is, if the rest of a man's* property is greatly enhanced in value by reason of the execution of a proposed public work, he shall not reap that profit and also receive the full value of the land he gave up to the Government. </para>

                        <para>- My experience is that experts know very little about the value of land, and that there is nothing so empirical in the world as the valuing of landed property. But in regard to the assessment of values, if I were asked to choose between arbitrators, a Judge and jury, and a Judge and assessors, I should certainly select the method adopted in the Bill, that of a Judge sitting alone. Arbitration is rightly put an end to, because with an arbitration we have an arbitrator on each side who is a partisan. The struggle before an arbitration, is to select an umpire who will be disposed to one side rather than the other. </para>

The Senate must" see that- no man with a small property could afford to allow his money to stand out;- at that small rate of interest. If he- received his money within a reasonable- time, he would be able to put' it to good use.- 'Victoria, like South Australia and New South Wales, has gone through various vicissitudes of circumstances in connexion with the acquisition of property,- until at last' we have got from one extreme to the other. The Government' are now able to acquire land on terms positively disadvantageous to the property owner. I do not think we should run to these extremes, because there is a proper way of dealing, not only between the Government and the private owner, but' between the Government and the community generally. If a man is dispossessed of his property, and his neighbour benefits by the action of the Government in acquiring that property, surely the neighbour should be called upon to contribute his quota towards making good the loss which the man has sustained. I do not think it' is necessary at this- stage to review the various phases of the Bill. That' is a work which can be better undertaken in committee. But I would point out that the system of1 betterment should receive fair and honest consideration. "Unless that' is done the owner of the land taken over will be put under a disability entirely for the benefit of his neighbour. </para>

There are one or Wo matters in which this Bill differs from ordinary Bills passed to enable the Government to acquire lands for public purposes, and'. I would direct the attention of the Senate to them. I.h the first place, it is recognised that the Government should have some authority from Parliament-to go . upon before land is resumed. It is generally provided that a .vote shall be passed by Parliament to enable the acquisition of laud for a particular purpose, and when that authority has been given , the Government may step in and secure the land. Unless the Government have a- vote out of, which they can pay compensation, I do not think' it is usual for the Government to resume property.

                        <para>- These are some of the difficulties which occurred to me, and of course it is well to mention them, so that they may be fairly considered in committee. I admit that I am running through the Bill for the first time to-day. I should also like to direct attention to clause 60, giving power to the Commonwealth to dispose of superfluous land. The question to my mind arises at once whether this power should be left entirely in the hands of the Governor-General in Council, without reference to the public in any way, or whether the land acquired and found to be unnecessary should be disposed of by public auction. I think it would be much safer to require the land to be disposed of by public auction in the event of its not being required for the purpose for which it was resumed. By that means there would be no possibility of any person turning round and saying - " This land was sold at an under value ; the Minister sold it to a friend for a certain sum without placing it on the open market." I think when we come to the clause it will be found advisable in the. first place to have the property offered for sale by public auction, and- if it does not realize the amount reserved then it should be in the hands of the Minister to dispose of privately to any person at a sum not less than that amount. By that means we would get rid of all pretence of any partiality being shown in the disposition of the land. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with this Bill, altogether. It is a most excellent Bill both in principle and detail. It fixes an absolutely fair basis - as fair as we can with our- limited knowledge fix oh*- on which - the value of' land taken shall be assessed,' and it fixes the tribunal for the purpose -of- its assessment'. We have had 'a great many years1 experience since the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act and the Railway Clauses -Consolidation Act came into force. We have known - all about appeals to arbitration with an umpire. We have known all about Judges with assessors. We have known all about Judges and juries sitting in this matter: We have known that in arbitration . there is a partisan on each side with an umpire who may give way more or less according to the persuasive powers of- his colleagues. A" jury are selected because they do not know anything about the case and therefore they are-more impartial. But on a question which requires some sort of' appreciation of- evidence, I' think the Judge would be able to decide- more excellently without the assistance of that somewhat uncertain tribunal. Should the Judge sit with assessors? I think he is better- without them. He will have the parties1 before him, and they will bring their assessors in their proper character as witnesses, and not as portions of the. bench. If the assessors come in they will practically be in the&gt; -position of arbitrators, and . one will . go one way, and one the other,' and will; be prejudiced more or less: I do not say that that: will materially affect, a- Judge if. the decision is left with- him. I .prefer the assessors in the witness-box- and-. the Judge on the bench.. He is accustomed in his wide experience not merely to measure men, but to estimate the value of- the evidence of assessors: I think the Bill hag been drawn with great care, will .work exceedingly well, and will prevent the Commonwealth in the acquisition :of properties, which it is necessary it should acquire for its own well-being, from being. victimized by -the eccentricities of judicial administration. </para>

                    (New South Wales Vice-President of' the Executive Council). - In reply; I have been very much obliged to ' several honorable senators for the points of view winch they have submitted for my consideration, but I think- when they look into the measure with a- care ful scrutiny, which I have been .obliged to give it, they will find that most of their -objections will disappear. There is one disability under which we all labour, without, perhaps; recognising, it. That is to say in each State we have been accustomed to have these particular matters dealt with in a certain way, and we probably all think that that is the best way. Until we have the matter considered, and - put before us from different points of view, perhaps that is only natural. I think that before this Bill gets out of committee, honorable senators will be satisfied with regard to any of those matters of procedure which are new, that, they have a great deal to recommend them, and that wherever there is any innovation introduced in this measure, it will find in reason and circumstances most ample justification. I do not wish to say anything in detail about the matter, except on two points. In the first place, as to the power to add the 10 per 'cent. It has been decided; not only in England,- but under a- similar statute in New South Wales, by the Supreme Court there, that this 10 per cent, is not a rule of* law at all; it has been the ordinary practice of ' Judges- to direct juries that it will be safe to add 10 per cent, for the " forced sale," as it is called; because compensation in matters of this kind should -not be weighed in golden scales; but' should be - given liberally. It is- usual to. add 10 per cent: for -forced sale in-order to make up anything which may have been1 omitted in the- estimate of value. .That rule 'will -still continue, and there will ' be nothing to prevent a Judge. adding the 10 per cent, or any amount lie may consider . fit, in order to make '.up for anything that may not have been considered in the estimate of value. After all, there is no possibility of .arriving at a mathematical rule of assessing damages. We cannot; lay it down in a statute or arrive at it in practice. -It must always be more or less of an estimate, and' I think it is a .good principle that the estimate should not be on an: illiberal- scale. I see great difficulty in providing that there shall be 10 per cent, added, because there . may be cases in which the forced sale has brought about no damage whatever. It may be that a man has had ample . notice and abundant opportunity of selling, at a. reasonable figure,
                    he may have refused it. .Under such circumstances, why should anything be given for a .forced sale? Under other circumstances it may be perfectly reasonable that something additional should be given, and I think it will be best to leave it in the hands of the authorities, who will have no interest to serve but that of . justice between the Commonwealth and the individual.

                    There is sure to be. I do not think there is anything else I need refer to now. I hope when the Bill gets into committee to have the assistance' of honorable senators. I have given very careful consideration to the Bill, which -seems to me to be very-well drawn, and I do not see any fault to find with it. If I am convinced by any honorable senator that it can be improved I shall' always be ready to receive any suggestion.

                (Tasmania).- This ClaUSe, as it stands, absolutely forbids any person sending any. letter- or message by any other person for hire or reward. On the second reading I pointed out that it seemed undesirable that the post-office should interfere with the arrangements made by a private person so as to forbid him even to pay a rate largely in excess of the postal rate if. he wished to have something sent by a private messenger in an emergency.

            <para>I submit, however, that the limitation to his " private affairs " is unnecessary, or, at any rate, that it is not desirable, to limit a person employing a messenger in an emergency to the sending of letters solely of a private nature. I point out also that it would not be easy to ascertain whether a message dealing only with a man's private affairs was being delivered in a closed envelope by a private messenger. I ask the Postmaster-General, if he is not-desirous of an absolutely exclusive monopoly, to alter paragraph (c) by omitting the words " concerning his private affairs." - </para>

                        <para>- I remind the honorable and learned senator that he started off by saying that the post-office makes no exceptions, and in the Bill of which he has charge, he immediately proceeds to make exceptions. My objection is that the exception is not taken widely enough, and that the limitation " concerning his private affairs " in paragraph (c) is too narrow. I submit that there would be no attempt made to take advantage of the Post-office, and as the paragraph stands the. Postmaster-General will be very seriously interfering in a way which, I take it, he would not himself recommend, with the liberties of individuals who might, in emergency, want to send something by private messenger that did not necessarily concern their own private affairs. </para>

                        <para>- It must be seen very clearly that if we alter the paragraph in the way suggested, we shall be opening the door to any amount of competition with the post office. Because then the clause will provide that any person- -and that is wide enough - may send anything by a special messenger. Under such a provision, any person could send a mail without any restriction whatever. He could employ " Thomas ' Jones " as a special messenger, and send him down Bourke-street delivering letters to any extent for hire and reward. </para>

                        <para>- The letter really asked a public body in Nannine to pass a resolution in reference to the notation of the company which was to be transmitted to London. It was held, however, that it was not a letter concerning Simpson's private affairs. That was a case of hardship such as would arise very rarely. Looking at the matter fairly, I think it is necessary that there should be such a clause in the Bill. The mere fact of a letter being closed does not create any difficulty ; because if a person is found carrying a letter he can be summoned, and will have a complete answer by producing the letter in court, when the justice of the peace will be able to see whether the letter is substantially on the sender's private affairs or not. </para>

                    <para>- I would direct the attention of the committee to a very drastic provision in this clause. It provides that any servant of the department, or any master of a vessel, or other person employed or authorized by or under any postmaster to receive,' sort, carry, or deliver any mail or any postal article sent by post or otherwise, who is . guilty of any neglect of duty, shall be liable to a fine of £100, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years.

                        <para>- The fine of £100 is the maximum penalty. It is necessary to protect the public in connexion with the postal business, and it is easy to imagine very serious breaches of duty on the part of a postmaster. Supposing such an officer wilfully neglected to send a mail forward, that would involve enormous inconvenience. In such a case we could not let a man off with merely a nominal fine. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps so, but let the other departments look after themselves. In order to carry out the postal business so as to insure the public receiving the full benefit of the service, we must be particularly strict in our dealings with postmasters and other officers in regard to the performance of their duties.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - The position taken up by the Postmaster-General would be perfectly right if this clause simply applied to masters of vessels and other persons outside the service doing work for the department. To-morrow, however, in all probability, we shall have the Public Service Bill before us. That measure deals with the public service as a whole, including officers of the Postal department, and it provides that any offence committed by a public servant shall be dealt with in a certain way, and punishment meted out by the commissioner, under regulations, according to the degree of the offence. This clause in the Postal Bill, however, takes from the Public Service Bill certain classes of public officers, and subjects them to very heavy fines and imprisonment at the will of the Minister in charge of the department.

There is no such section in the Victorian Act, because in this State we have had since 1884 a Public Service Act, under which all offences by officers under the Government can be dealt with. When the Public Service Bill reaches us we shall find that this clause clashes with its provisions. </para>

                        <para>- That shows the weakness of the Bill, and that the Postmaster-General should have larger powers to deal with such persons. A station-master in charge of an office in a district which I once represented in Queensland committed a most serious offence. The station was some 23 miles distant from Brisbane, and the station-master had to deal with postal matters. He collected letters from the inhabitants, and when he ran short of stamps and was expecting them by the next train the people gave him their letters, together with the money to pay for postage. Ultimately this man appropriated certain moneys, and then it was discovered that behind a desk to which the public had not access a large bundle of letters had been concealed. They comprised the letters which the station-master had received, together with money to pay for the stamps. He had simply appropriated the money and hidden the letters. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I would respectfully impress upon the Postmaster-General, who evidently has taken this clause from the' New South Wales Act, that he should consult his own legal knowledge. The objection to the clause is not so much in regard to the amount of the punishment, but the fact that it is to be left entirely to the discretion of justices of the. peace. If the offence is one that ordinarily arises under the postal service, we have it dealt with throughout this Act. If it is an offence criminally, such as those referred to by
                    the common law meets it. Therefore, this clause provides that for a breach or neglect of duty which is not provided for as an offence in any other way, a man may get two years' imprisonment. A man may receive two years' imprisonment for an offence which no other principle of the common law would render penal, and which, consequently, is so remote and visionary that it is not even specifically provided for. I think this is a 'shocking drag-net.

                        <para>- " For breach or neglect of which no other punishment is hereby provided." It must refer to matters for which no other punishment is provided. How could it be suggested that a man should receive two years' imprisonment for stealing from the postal service, when he might get five years' imprisonment, 'for stealing from some other department ? When you say the offence is not hereby provided, you must mean an offence other than such as is provided for by the general code, and outside those dealt with by the Bill. Therefore, in effect, it is said in the clause, "we will give a justice of the peace power to inflict two years' imprisonment for an offence which is not contrary to the ordinary criminal law, and which is not contrary to the special requirements necessary to carry out this Act, but which is merely neglect." I would suggest .that the whole clause be struck out ; and I would say to the Postmaster-General that it is very easy for him, and others like him, to think out another means of dealing with the particular class of persons they have in their minds. They should be dealt with in a special clause so that we might know what we are about. </para>

                        <para>- With regard to the fines which may be made by regulation - those fines which it was suggested should be limited to £5, and which in State Acts have been restricted to that amount - for small breaches of discipline in the office. If we omit the clause we shall have no means of keeping control over postmasters and persons who are engaged in transmitting mails, and punishing them if they wilfully neglect their duty, thereby causing an enormous inconvenience to the public. It is said that £100 is too large a fine. It is about one of the most difficult things I suppose which can possibly be decided, for the simple reason that until we know the particular neglect of duty is in a case, we do not know what penalty will meet it. The ordinary fines are fixed by the Governor in Council, and probably either the Postmaster-General or a deputy would have the power of inflicting them without any form of trial. The Bill provides in this case that before any penalty can be inflicted, the- man must be tried, no doubt by a police magistrate' or by justices. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. The genera] provision in regard to infliction of fines in the department is that the matter is to be fixed by regulation made by the Governor-General, so that under that power the Minister could not ' possibly fine up to £100 under this clause; it gives no power whatever to the Postmaster-General or a deputy to fine. Before any one could be fined under this clause he would have to be tried either before a stipendiary magistrate or two justices o'f the peace. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened with a great deal of attention and a perfectly open mind, and have come to the conclusion that the clause is not wanted. It seeks to impose a penalty on postmasters and others for a breach of duty. In another place there is a Bill passing for the purpose of treating all persons who are employed by the Commonwealth and making proper regulations to provide sufficient punishment for any breach of official duty, therefore we do not want in this Bill a special clause referring to breaches of duty. Take the extreme case which the Minister mentioned - the case of an officer who wilfully detains a mail. Will any one say that there will not be a provision in the Public Service Bill to deal with that case, and to mete out to the officer punishment either summary or otherwise. Of course there will be. The Public Service Act will meet all possible cases. Therefore the cases of postal officers will be met by that Act. </para>

                        <para>- A number of them are subject to the Postal department, and of course we do not know in what form that Bill may leave this Chamber. In another State, at all events, a very great number of the servants in the Postal department are expressly exempted from the provisions of the Public Service Bill. So we do not know, until we come to discuss that Bill, whether it will not be found advisable to exempt at all events some classes of servants in the post-office. I feel perfectly sure, without having gone thoroughly into that Bill, we shall find, when it does come down, that it will not sufficiently provide for the control and discipline of the Postal department. Therefore, it may perhaps- be of advantage to exempt postal officials from the operation of that Bill ; but certainly it has not come to us yet, and I think we should not discuss it. </para>

                    <para>- I am so exceedingly anxious that we should get on that I have refrained from speaking. We must give power to the Postal department to deal with those who wilfully' neglect their duty. The whole public are interested in the matter, and it is for us to give reasonable power to see that the Act is carried out properly. This clause is designed to meet a case of wilful neglect. Although it gives power to fine up to £100, it may be a fine of 100 shillings or one shilling ; and although it gives power to imprison for two years, it may be a term of two hours. Honorable senators are talking as if the maximum fine or imprisonment were going to be exercised in every case. There are many persons outside the service who deal with postal matters, and it is only right that the Minister should be given the power to control them. It might be very disastrous indeed if we did not give him that power. </para>

                    1 have been listening to the discussion with a very open mind. It seems to me that it is desirable that some provision of this sort should be introduced; but the defect of it is in imposing an alternative punishment of two years' imprisonment, and that that should be inflicted at the option of a police magistrate or any magistrate who may be authorized under the Summary Procedure Act.

It is a most monstrous thing - an unprecedented thing, I think - to put it into the power of any magistrate to send a man to goal for two years. I do not know of any precedent for it in any legislation anywhere. A term of six months or something like that is enough. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Take this clause. A breach of duty is a serious, but it is not a criminal offence. A man may be guilty of manslaughter from a breach of duty, and it may involve culpable negligence, but in respect to a charge of that kind he is tried by his peers - a j jury I think the Minister will be well advised if he adopts the suggestion either of having the clause re-drafted, or of striking out the provision which would enable him to send a man to goal for two years for a mere breach of duty. </para>

                    <para>- It has been stated here that it is possible in New South Wales for a magistrate to sentence an accused person to two years' gaol. Such a provision does not exist in New South Wales. Six months is the maximum. I have never heard of such a proposition as this - that a man should be sent to gaol for two years by an ill-informed magistrate for an indefinite offence which does not exist at present. We are asked to manufacture a penalty for a crime that some one else is subsequently to manufacture. I rise simply to say that I cannot allow it to go forward that the law in New South Wales permits magistrates to sentence people to two years' gaol. Even if it were the law in New South Wales, it is not the law elsewhere, and we are now making laws not to be administered according to the whims of any one State, but according to the laws of the whole of the States. In other words, we are asked by this proposition to extend the jurisdiction and powers of magistrates in the different States,, and that we have not the power to do. The Commonwealth does not appoint those magistrates. They are appointed by the Governments of the different States, and we cannot by passing this Bill . extend their jurisdiction and power from a sentence of six months to a sentence of 24 months. I suggest that the clause should be postponed, for the present at least, and re-drafted in the light of the legal information which has been supplied, and which evidently was not before the heads of the different postal branches who have compiled this measure. </para>

                    (New South Wales).I point out that the very thing which it is proposed to deal with under clause 103 by a fine of £100 is dealt with under clause 104 by a fine of £25, and without any provision for an alternative of imprisonment. . A person who detains the mails, to the public inconvenience, may be dealt with under clause 104 by a fine of £25. I ask the Postmaster-General, therefore, to accept my amendment, and make the fine under this clause for that offence £25.

                        <para>- That only applies to persons employed by the department, while clause 103 refers to a great number of others. I merely gave that illustration as one instance, without reference to other cases, of wilful neglect of duty. I would like to put myself right with regard to the section in the New South Wales Act from which clause 103 is taken. I may say that the maximum penalty there is £100, and the only difference is that there is no provision for imprisonment. This is the section appearing in the New South Wales Act - </para>

Before the Postmaster-General quoted the section from the New South Wales Act, I had myself read it in that Act, which has been in operation in New South Wales for 34 years. I find that the terms of that section are practically the same as those embodied in the clause under discussion, except that there is no provision for the alternative penalty of imprisonment. </para>

                    (New South Wales).I think
                    has supplied a strong additional argument against the retention of this clause. He invites us to go back for 34 years, over a generation, to shape our laws by the provisions adopted at that time. If there is one tendency which law-making has developed of late years it is to make punishments less severe. If we are to go back 34 years for an example, why not go back 100- years, when shop-lifting was a capital offence
                    I can quite understand such suggestions coming from a Toryism willing to take examples from the musty past, but we want something more in keeping with the liberal tendencies of the day. If the argument used by
                    is an argument at all, it is one distinctly against the retention of the clause.

Clause 103 has been taken from the New South Wales Postal Act, and that was denied by representatives of New South Wales. If they did not absolutely deny it, they seriously questioned and discredited the statement. In a progressive age like the twentieth century, a great many contingencies may arise out of the improvements and progress which may be made within the next five years. </para>

                    <para>- If asked to vote, I shall record my vote against the clause, which is altogether too sweeping. Any servant employed may come under the penalty if he fails " to comply with any of the arrangements " to be made under the Bill. What are the " arrangements ' ? That term may cover a very slight offence against the regulations made under this Bill. I think the Postmaster-General, in copying this from the New South Wales Act, did not take into consideration the sweeping character of the "clause. I shall have no hesitation in voting against it, so that the Postmaster-General may have an opportunity to draft another clause which will be less drastic. I think clause 104 will meet all that is required by the Postmaster-General from the clause at present under discussion. </para>

I object to such heavy penalties for the punishment of offences which are to arise under regulations that are to be made in the future. The vote I shall give will be in favour of reducing the £100 penalty, and striking out the provision with regard to the two years' imprisonment altogether. </para>

                    himself read the section of the New South Wales Act, and by so doing showed that it was not identical with this clause. The penalty of imprisonment is not in the New South Wales Act.

                        <para>- I will explain why I do not think it advisable to do so. There is a great deal in having the wording of clauses kept as nearly as possible to the language of Acts that have been in existence for some time. We thus secure the advantage of judicial decisions. If this clause has been in the New South Wales Postal Act for 34 years, in the Queensland A.ct for 11 or 12 years, and probably in other acts in other States for a number of years, it is not advisable to alter the wording further than , is absolutely necessary. </para>

It will be well for the Minister to accept the advice that has been offered to him by
                    Symon. I object to the clause as being a drag-net provision which will be a terror to every public servant.

Furthermore, I grumble that we have a Bill placed - before us which says in a marginal note that a certain clause is taken from a certain Act of Parliament in another State, and it is subsequently found that the clause although taken from that Act, has been altered in a great many particulars. An enormous penalty is imposed by the clause, which is not imposed in the other Act. We should be informed if clauses are altered when they are transferred from existing Acts. That is the practice in South Australia. If only a verbal alteration be made an intimation to that effect is given in the marginal note. In future it will be a great convenience if that practice is followed. I venture to think that this clause must be copied from an old obsolete provision which has never been acted upon in New South Wales, and has produced no results. If the Postmaster-General will postpone the clause, and will in the meantime telegraph to New South Wales and ask whether this provision has ever been acted upon there, and what benefits have been derived from it, the committee will be glad of the information. If the Deputy Postmaster-General of New South Wales can say that it has been acted upon, then I shall be quite willing to assist the Government in placing it in the Bill. I am confident, however, that a clause like this has been obsolete for years.

                        <para>- No. The reason why I object to the omission of the three subclauses is that I think they are necessary. Sub-clause (c) of this clause is not in the corresponding section of the New South Wales Act, but I think it is very desirable to enact that while the driver is actually in charge, of His Majesty's mails he ought to be sober. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with what the Postmaster-General has said with reference to a person being actually in charge of mails ; but the clause does not say anything of the kind. He read an extract from some Act, and I protest against our having merely to sit here to copy other Acts. Surely federation was intended to work some improvement? And surely my honorable and learned friend does not sit here merely to introduce transcripts of antiquated laws % He read an extract from an Act- - I forget of what State - -but there was this great difference, that he read the word "or" instead of the conjunction "and." </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether that would be due to the weather. I could read it in another way to show that any vehicle that is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and cannot plead not guilty on account of the weather, is to be liable to a penalty of £10. It can be read in such a variety of ways that it would take some time to do it. But I am astonished at the Minister complaining of delay here in proceeding with the Bill. Surely we are discharging a most patriotic duty in putting in a length of time over this measure to afford the Ministry an opportunity for considering their financial policy. </para>

                    <para>- One would imagine that when the driver of a mail coach gets off his box in the remote parts of the Commonwealth his duties are over, and he is no longer in charge of the mail. Let me assure honorable senators that nothing of the kind is the case. In many places, the driver of a vehicle carrying a mail, or a man carrying a mail with a pack-horse goes hundreds of miles, and he is constantly in charge of the mail. I have travelled to the 'Gulf by the mail coaches, and I know what I am speaking of. I say that once a man commences his journey from Winton to the Gulf as a mail-man, whether he has a packhorse or a trap he is constantly in charge of the mail. It would be absurd to allow drunken men to have charge of the mails. These men should be sober and reliable men. I agree that the wording of the clause may not be very elegant, but I believe these clauses will be more easily understood than more scientific clauses drafted by scientific lawyers. I think we ought not to spend so much time over them. </para>

                    (New South Wales).I think I can suggest an amendment that would get over the difficulty. I suggest that we might omit the words " driver of a vehicle used for the conveyance of mails and any guard or other," in lines 1 and 2. In that way we would attach the penalty only to the person in charge of the mail.

                        <para>- We do not wish to punish the driver when he is not on duty. He might be driving his coach for the purpose of the mail one day in the week, and driving it during the rest of the week for other purposes than the transport of the mail. Two men cannot be in charge of the mail. There may be three or four associated with it, but there will be one man in charge, who receives a receipt for the mail from the postmaster, and gets a receipt from the postmaster to whom he delivers the mail. That is the person on whom the responsibility must rest, and to whom the penalty must attach. If the amendment at. present before the committee is withdrawn, I will ' move the amendment I have suggested. </para>

                        <para>- In regard to the amendment suggested, substituting the word " or " for the word " and," I do not think it would greatly alter the sense, but it would certainly have the effect of . throwing 'the expression " person in charge of a mail" back to the commencement of the sentence more clearly. The intention of the clause is clear that the person to whom it is to apply is the person in charge of the mail, and he may be either the driver of a vehicle, the guard, or some other person. I think that would be made clear if were substituted the word " or " for the word " and," as has been suggested. If that is done, we shall be in accord then with the New South Wales Postal Act, and perhaps we shall be all right with William IV. </para>

                    <para>- The person in charge of . the mail need not necessarily be the driver of the vehicle. Persons are often sent in charge of the mail in addition to the driver who is usually in charge of the mail. Such a provision as this is essentially necessary in the interests of the public. I have had practical experience of its necessity, as I have been delayed for two days, after having to pay £5 10s. coach fare and 10s. a day for keep for which I should riot have been liable, not because the coach could not go on or because there was any breakdown, but simply through neglect of duty on the part of persons in. charge of the mail. When we know that persons in some parts have to wait 20 and 30 days for a mail, it is very objectionable that they should have to wait two or three days more in consequence of the culpable neglect of the person in charge of the mail. 1 point out that both the driver and the person in charge of the mail may be culpable and it would be unfair in such a case to single out one and let the other go scot free. </para>

                    <para>- I think senators should not be too captious in discussing a clause like this, which is for the convenience of the public. If the honorable senators had lived as I have done in some of the remote parts of New South Wales, they would know what an important matter this is. Mails are carried in New South Wales for thousands of miles on horseback, going about from store to store, and unless the greatest care is taken and those in charge are placed under disabilities for neglect, the mails might not be delivered. Some of the remarks which have been made have not been worthy of the occasion.- We are here to carry out public business and if there should be a little slip in the language of the clause it is the duty of honorable senators to rectify it. This is one of the most valuable clauses in the Bill, and those who have lived in places remote from centres of population will know how necessary it is that the Government should hold mail-men with a firm grip. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the committee had best pass the clause as it stands. AVe are dealing with a matter of practical experience in the management of the carrying of these mails. This clause exists in all the State Mail Acts, and it has been found from experience to be necessary. Any man who has had much experience of travelling in remote parts of the country, as most of us had in the old coaching days, will not fail to realize that mails containing most important matter are often in the charge of a "boy of fifteen or seventeen years, who may have to stop a day or a night at some outside public-house, miles away from police protection of any kind. Under these circumstances the Postmaster-General must have some special hold on employes of that kind. There is no hardship about it. Any person applying to be employed in the business will have an opportunity of knowing what this provision is, and will know that he may be fined if he gets drunk while in charge of mails. </para>

                    <para>- This clause provides that the punishment for stealing letters may be imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years. I always thought the maximum term of imprisonment was two years, and that after that time the punishment was penal servitude. </para>

                        <para>- That is so in some of the States. I think the point will be dealt with upon some comprehensive plan. I am under the impression that the Acts Interpretation Act deals with the meaning of the word "imprisonment." In Queensland it is the rule that for two years a convicted person is to be imprisoned with o hard labour, and that that term is the maximum of imprisonment. The minimum for penal servitude there is three years ; but I do not know whether that is so under the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- It is questionable whether the Commonwealth has power to make a provision of this kind. Surely the control of the streets is a matter within the purview of the municipal government. The licensing of vehicles plying for hire, and the position of cab-stands, are matters for the municipality. Apart from the absurdity of such a provision, it is questionable whether the Commonwealth has power to make it. </para>

                    <para>- Within the last month the police in Melbourne arrested two children who dropped some matches into a letter-box and set fire to a number of letters. It would be ridiculous to indict mere children to appear before a Judge and jury, and I think the committee should pause before it allows this power to be taken out of the hands of the Postmaster-General. There is a maximum fine of £50 provided, but it does not follow that such -a penalty would be imposed by justices in a trivial case. A child might be imprisoned -until the rising of the court, or even fined a shilling. I think the Postmaster-General should be armed. with a sufficient authority to enable him to protect these pillar-boxes, but the clause goes far enough. . Amendment agreed to. </para>

                        <para>- An hotel-keeper might sell stolen stamps. There is no more power under this clause to prevent the sale of stolen stamps than there is to prevent the sale of a stolen horse. There is no check. If money is stolen it may be passed from hand to hand in the same way. If stamps are stolen it is perhaps less difficult to get rid of them in large parcels than it would be to get rid of a large sum of stolen money. The object of this provision is really not to prevent the sale of stolen stamps, but to secure a monopoly to licensed sellers of postage stamps. They are under the control of the department, but the licence means nothing. There is no charge for it. </para>

                        <para>- Much less than a cabbage. A man was hanged if he was guilty of almost any petty theft. The absurdity of it is in this century putting on the Commonwealth statute-book a provision that any one selling a postage stamp incurs a liability of £5. Supposing that any one of us, to convenience a friend, sold 5s. worth of postage stamps to him, he is liable to have an information laid against him at the hands of an officious postmaster or some officious policeman, or some seller who may say that his trade is in danger, and he may be brought up before a police court. </para>

Taking sub-clause (6), is it not ridiculous that we are putting that provision on the Commonwealth statute book to be a model for ages to come ? It says that anybody is liable to a penalty of £5 who - places or permits, or causes to be placed, or suffers to remain on or near to his house or premises, the words " licensed to sell postage stamps." </para>

                    (New South Wales). - I venture to say that the more honorable senators consider the clause, the less they will like it. It is a policy, I may say the boast, of one post-office, that it does all it possibly can to promote and not to thwart the convenience of the public. It is a great convenience to the public to be able to get postage stamps easily, and any effort put forward by the post-office which decreases the facilities for obtaining postage stamps lessens the facilities which it grants to the public. We are bringing our letter-boxes as near as we can to all who post letters. Why not, then, let them have postage stamps with every possible facility ? It appears to me that the Postmaster-General would do well if he would consent to the elimination ' of the clause, but if he insists on proceeding with it E shall be prepared to propose an amendment.

                        <para>- Will the Minister tell me how any one can charge more than a penny for a penny stamp, or how, unless' he is to be fraudulent, he can give less than a certain article. A licence, therefore, in no way protects the revenue. It in no way saves abuse in the sale of postage stamps. The only possible tiling it can do is to render it more difficult for the peculator to carry on his trade. When we consider the small amount of good it will do in that way, and set it against the great inconvenience it is to the public, we shall see that it is a clause which should not be allowed to stand. </para>

As I understand it the principle of penal legislation is to prevent persons doing what they have some incentive or some inclination to do. What possible incentive has a person to put up a placard to say that he is licensed to sell stamps, when he cannot make a penny profit by the sale of a million stamps ? The only person who can make money by the sale of stamps is the person who gets the 2^ per cent, from the Postal department. </para>

                        <para>- It is exactly the same thing. We have passed clause 91 prescribing the form and method of issuing licences for the sale of stamps, and the commission to be paid therefor ; and now it is proposed when we come to the clause which prevents an unlicensed person from selling stamps to strike out the provision and permit any one to sell them. If we are going to allow any person to sell stamps in any little shop it will be, I will not say an encouragement to steal stamps, but it will certainly make the way of the transgressor easier. </para>

                    <para>- The remarks of the Postmaster-General certainly throw a new light upon the matter. The main object of the Minister is to restrict the free issue of stamps. He wishes to compel those persons who desire to send small sums of money through the post to take out postal orders. That may be all very well from the Postmaster-General's point of view, and may bring grist to his mill, but there is such a thing, as the convenience of the public. It is infinitely more troublesome to the public to have to go probably some distance to take out a postal-note, for which they have to pay, than to put a few postage stamps to the amount required in an envelope. While I sympathize with the Minister in his desire to bring in as much profit to the post-office as possible, I sympathize a great deal more with the 'public in their desire to save as much trouble as they can. The Postmaster-General has given us information which will be of value to the mercantile community of Melbourne, in connexion with Tattersall's sweeps. We have often wondered what becomes of the great number of postage stamps just about the time when money is being sent to Tattersall's. That is the very time, bear in mind, when the temptation to speculation on the part of those who have charge of postage stamps is greatest. We know that Tattersall's is the receiving office of a large number of stamps - to the extent of £10,000. I understood the Minister to say. Not only does Tattersall receive these stamps, but the post-office, by buying them back, becomes a party to the fraud. </para>

                    <para>- One reason for retaining this clause in the Bill is, that it is a preventative of forgery. It may become a lucrative business to forge postage stamps if they are allowed to be sold indiscriminately. If only licensed persons are allowed to vend stamps the Postmaster-General has a certain power of tracing them, because those to whom licences are issued must be people of some standing. </para>

                    Does the Postmaster-General intend to prosecute people who sell stamps without having a licence
                    If the clause is not to be carried out, it is a waste of time to ask the Senate to pass a useless law. It is of no use putting upon the statutes-book a provision intended to be a dead letter. The Postmaster-General has made out a case for the clause if he intends to carry it out in its integrity, but if he intends to administer it with both eyes shut we are wasting time in carrying it into law.

                <para>
                    (Western Australia)- - I think it is light to point out what
                    has said, that paragraph
                    is not a necessary consequence of paragraph
                    for this reason. It is one thing for the Postmaster-General to say we desire to earmark the places at which stamps are sold, but it is another thing to say that the public have the same inclination to ear-mark the places. The only reason why people can desire to put the words "licensed to sell" over their shop doors is that they gain something by it. Clearly under this clause people gain nothing. I find on looking at the English Act, that while a portion of paragraph
                    is in it, paragraph
                    is not to be found there at all. It is an innovation. Any one reading the English Act sees that the idea of the framers was not to prevent persons selling stamps without a licence, but to give the Postmaster-General a knowledge of the places where stamps are sold. The words used in the English Act would be unobjectionable in our measure. They are -

                <para>We all agree with the Postmaster-General that it is right that he should know the quarters in which stamps are sold, and dealt in by way of business, but we object to a clause which prevents ordinary transfers of stamps from private individuals, or the sending of them in letters in exchange for other commodities. The English section, would not, I think, make it unlawful to send8d. or 9d. in stamps through the post. </para>

                        <para>- It means the wrongful sending of a telegram, which need not necessarily be a false one. It is hard to conceive how a man could wrongfully send a telegram in the name of a fictitious person. I think this is an imaginary offence. If it is one which cannot possibly come within actual realization it is quite unnecessary to legislate against it. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion the provision in regard to the sending of a telegram in the name of a fictitious person is very necessary. On the gold-fields it has been found to be absolutely indispensable. Cases occur where people send bogus telegrams about rich finds in the mines, and sign them under fictitious names. In a mining community, where people are waiting to hear news of a mine, a telegram is sometimes sent by a person who alters the christian name, perhaps, of some well-known man, but uses the surname. That would be a fictitious name. Such messages are sent perhaps to a person who is endeavouring to sell shares for the sender. It would be exceedingly dangerous to leave out this provision and thus make it legal to send telegrams under a false name. There have been cases in Kalgoorlie where telegrams sent under a fictitious name have led to a rise in mining shares. </para>

In order do send shares up or down, as the case maybe, some person falsely and wrongfully sends a tele in the name of that individual with the one alteration that he signs it as " G. J. Jones," instead of " G. T. Jones." The addressee supposes it to be a mere slip, and the person who sent it, if found out, would say that he did not intend the telegram to be understood as coming from "G. T. Jones." </para>

If it is the name of a person who only exists in the sender's imagination, then it is a fictitious name. </para>

If that name happens to be that of a person whom the sender knows, then the offence comes under the first category. If it happens to lie a name which the sender invents, it comes within the second category.

                        <para>- I expect that regulation has been made because it has been found almost impossible to stop the practice, but under the regulations I have been accustomed to the person who lias the telephone is under an obligation not to allow any one outside his own clerks and servants and family to use it. Otherwise, a man might pay £5 or £6 a year for a telephone, and make it serve, perhaps, for hundreds of persons. I know there is a very great difficulty, amounting almost to an impossibility, to check that sort of thing. But there is a system - I forget exactly the technical name of it - by which the number of messages is automatically recorded. </para>

                        <para>- The number of messages is recorded, and then an extra charge is made for the excess number of calls. That seems to me to be the fairest way, and it is a method which certainly will have to be adopted, though, of course, it will involve a considerable amount of expense. So soon as that is done all arrangements with regard to the number of persons speaking through a telephone can be done away with. The practice which has obtained in some places of a number of persons in one building using a telephone which is in the name of one person has not been recognised by any regulations that I know of. </para>

There are many private lines erected at the joint expense of a number of persons. While so far as the department is concerned it stands in the name of one person, each party contributes to the rent. Could not a provision be made for such a case not coming within the penalty of the clause ? I think we ought to have a provision of that kind.

                    <para>- I think there is something wrong in the clause. As I understand the law, if an ordinary bystander sees another in the act of committing a felony, he is then entitled to arrest him, but that is a misdemeanour, I take it. It is a very drastic tiling to alter one of the fundamental principles of the criminal law, and allow a bystander to arrest a man for a misdemeanour under this Act. </para>

                <para>
                    (New South Wales). - In the very class of country which the Postmaster-General referred to the lines pass over sparsely populated districts, and what is to prevent any one from coming along, and because he sees a man who may be acting suspiciously towards a line, or because he for some other reason pretends that the passer-by is doing it, from immediately arresting that man and dragging him perhaps 100 miles to the nearest police station ? If a man wants to interfere, if he desires to protect public property he will stop the commission of the offence, and having done that he will be able to give information to the nearest officer of police. That is quite sufficient. Why do we want to clothe that man with the authority to make a constable of himself straight away ? He may make a tremendous nuisance of himself by arresting a man for the purpose of spite or by dragging him a very long distance to the nearest police station. There can be no greater protection of the property of the Postmaster-General by the clause than without it. If a person is prepared to go to the extreme of arresting the offender, he certainly will step in and stop him from carrying out the offence if he can, and if he has stopped him there is no great hurry about the arrest, because information can then be given to the ordinary police officer, who can proceed against the offender.

                        <para>- Sometimes out in the far west we have cases, which seem to me to be abominable crimes, of men cutting down a telegraph post to boil a billy. Surely we are entitled to take some extraordinary means not usually recognised by the law to prevent the commission of such offences and if necessary to punish the offenders. The whole of the telegraphic communication of a continent may be thrown out simply because a man happens to be too lazy to go and get firewood unless we can enlist the sympathy and help of any one who may happen to be there when there is no police constable to stop an offence of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- The harm is in putting a provision in the Bill which will be a dead letter. All legislation is brought into disrepute when that sort of thing prevails. We might follow this with a chapter from Genesis, and say that it was a proper thing to introduce into this Bill, because it could do no harm. </para>

                        <para>- Not only will it not do any harm, but I think it is going to do a lot of good. I have stated special reasons why it is necessary to have special means to protect telegraph lines and apparatus. I mentioned the case of men out in the far west who sometimes commit offences of that kind. But there are a number of different classes of persons who, under a provision of this kind will be able to help in protecting telegraph property - many officers of the telegraph department, and officers of the railway department also, because a great many telegraph lines run alongside railways, and injury might be done to some of them. No doubt if I went on I could mention other classes of persons who would be able to assist in protecting the property of the telegraph department. 1 know it is an unusual provision, but it deals with unusual circumstances, and that is a sufficient justification. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - It has occurred to me, I do not know whether the Postmaster-General has also thought of it, that a clause of this kind may, in not very improbable circumstances, lead not only to a breach of the peace but to manslaughter. The Postmaster-General is well aware of the reason of the ordinary rule of law, that only a policeman or a person armed with a warrant can arrest another. Everybody is supposed to know that one is not justified in resisting an officer of the law. If a person is arrested by one clothed in police uniform or having a warrant, he will not resist because he knows that the punishment is very severe for resistance. But if I am engaged in cutting down a telegraph-post, and an individual comes up to me who is not in policeman's clothes, and has no warrant, and endeavours to arrest me, I will feel that he has no right to arrest me, and that I am justified - as I would be if tins clause were not here - in using as much force as may be necessary to repel him. If he persisted in his attack I might persist in my resistance, until, perhaps, the result might be severe injuries or loss of life. That is a thing which is not only possible, but exceedingly probable under this clause. The law is most careful to have it brought well home to a man, that he cannot resist arrest by lawful authority, and persons are very often in the criminal courts sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for resisting, however slightly, arrest by a policeman. The object is to leave a healthy feeling upon the minds of the public that once our liberty is sought to be obstructed, by one who bears the badge of authority upon him, we must put down our hands and trust to a court to vindicate our innocence. But if a person arrests another, who is not justified by law in doing so, then the person sought to be arrested is entitled to resist, whatever violence is used by the person seeking to arrest him, even to the killing of that person, if he will not permit one's liberty otherwise. How will these persons in the far west know of this clause? Where we may have to deal with full-blooded passionate individuals with all the wildness of nature due to the desolation around them in the backwoods such a clause may well lead to loss of life.
