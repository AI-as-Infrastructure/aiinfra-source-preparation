                        <para>- I am indebted to you, sir, for mentioning that matter. Our view is, if possible, to have some method of printing by which papers can be printed simply " by order of Parliament," whether the order is made by one House or the other. The whole matter is being taken into consideration, and as soon as possible there will be some method arrived at which I hope will enable both Houses to work together in the interests of the country. It does not lie in the mouth of any member of the Printing Committee to complain that it has not been called together. Nobody can call it together except a member of it. </para>

                    <para>- I shall oppose the amendment. I do not think a reference to a committee, as to what should or should not be printed, is likely to facilitate the business of the Senate This idea of limiting the printing bill appears to me to savour somewhat of the penny wise and pound foolish brand of .economy. Very often we find . honorable senators quite ready to squander thousands of pounds uselessly, in my opinion ; but when we come down to the necessary work of printing, they suddenly become stricken by a passion for economy. If any paper is worth being i presented to the Senate, it is worth being printed. If the expense of getting a return for an honorable senator has been gone to, surely it ought to be. printed for the edification of the Senate. How are honorable senators to read such papers if they are not printed ? How are they to be posted up in information which they require for the proper conduct of the business of the Senate 7 I have no doubt that a number of honorable senators throw their papers into the waste-paper basket, not read and not looked at. They take no trouble with regard to the business of the country. </para>

                        <para>- In any case those who seem to be economically minded, so far as printing is concerned, do not appear to me to be very anxious to read papers which are presented for their edification, or to study returns which have been moved for by others. The Senate ought to be the supreme judge of what should be printed. If we were as anxious to economize in other directions as we appear to be in the printing bill, the business of the Commonwealth might be carried on at very much less expense than it is likely to be. </para>

                    <para>- There is nothing unusual in the procedure which we have adopted. I am a member of the Printing Committee, and when in the Legislative Council of South Australia, I was 'also a member of the Printing Committee. In that House, when a paper was laid upon the table, and an honorable member or a Minister desired that it should be printed, he moved to that effect, or, failing an order to print, if he desired to have the opinion of the Printing Committee, he asked that the matter should be considered by 'that body. We have had a 'good many papers of more or less value laid upon the 'table, and I think whenever important papers have been tabled, there -has been a request made that they be printed. It is true that the matter is entirely in the hands df the Senate. If any honorable -member has had a paper laid upon the table which he desires to have printed, he should notify some member of the Printing Committee to that effect, and then it would be called together and give its decision. </para>

                    (PostmasterGeneralQueensland). - I join -with my -honorable and learned colleague in asking
                    not to press his amendment to a division. It is desirable that some steps should be. taken to keep some check on the amount- of printing done for both Houses, otherwise it might amount to such dimensions that honorable members would be deterred from moving for returns of great value. When the Printing Committee is in proper order, it ought to be able to exercise such a check. When a motion is made that a paper be printed, the Senate is not aware of its contents ; it votes blindly without knowing whether it is a paper which should be printed - a fact which
                    seemed to overlook - but the Printing Committee has an opportunity of seeing whether it is of such a nature as to justify the cost of printing.

                        <para>- But surely it is not the first Bill that came to us that we have to consider. The Customs Bill came to the Senate, and we made certain amendments in it. It then went back to the other Chamber. I presume that the House of Representatives dealt with the Bill as we sent it to them, and if they wanted to restore anything we had eliminated they must have referred to that Bill to find out where the restoration should take place. </para>

                        <para>- But surely we expect to have to look at the Bill we sent from the Senate in order to see which of our amendments have been disagreed with. We find that a large number of amendments have been agreed to by the House of Representatives, and that others have been altered or eliminated. We ought to deal with the Bill as it left this Chamber, embodying our final revision, in order that we may know what has become of the amendments we made. </para>

I do not know what object the honorable and learned senator has in making these comments. There is no difficulty in finding the amendments. I have been through every one of them carefully, and have not had the least difficulty in finding them. We shall take them in detail, and I do not think that honorable senators will have any difficulty whatever in ascertaining what has become of amendments made by the Senate, if they refer to the Bill itself. </para>

                    <para>- We made certain amendments in this clause, and the proposal of the House of Representatives is to adopt a portion of our amendments and strike out the rest. As a mere matter of drafting, it was thought that the clause as originally introduced into the Senate did not specifically give the power to break open chests, trunks, and packages, where goods might be or were supposed to be. We amended the clause by inserting the words "and search" after the word " into," and by omitting the words " the same and " after the word " open," and inserting in lieu thereof the words "and search." The House of Representatives propose to restore the words "the same and," and also to leave in the word "search," and under their proposal the clause would read in this way - </para>

It may be that the parties think that it does not involve a contravention of the Act, and although it may not do so yet it may be one of those cases which certainly ought to be tried in the ordinary way before a court. It may involve questions of law which the Minister does not think he ought to decide, but if the word "shall" is retained it will compel the Minister to decide it. </para>

                        <para>- The debate was as to the means the Minister should take to inform his mind, and as to whether he should hear evidence on both sides. The parties interested may refer to the Minister a question of which it would be utterly wrong for him to undertake the interpretation, but the clause as it is makes him the final arbiter. Surely this ought not to be made obligatory on the Minister. I think the amendment is a proper one. </para>

One result of the presence of a clause of this kind is that it is always in the power of the Customs officers to call upon the owner of the goods to give security. Knowing that there is this power, it acts as a safeguard. The power need not be always exercised. It probably will only be exercised where Custom-house officers have a suspicion that some improper operation is likely to take place. Then there is some one responsible whom they can deal with after possession of the goods has been parted with. In most cases possession of the goods themselves is a sufficient security, but here possession is parted with, and they are no longer under the control of the Customs. What position will the Customs be in if goods are landed again or treated in some way which evades payment of duty ? Therefore, it is a very necessary safeguard to have this clause in the Bill. It is in the Acts of all the States already, and considering the much larger area we have to deal with under the Commonwealth, and the larger extent of customs we shall have to deal with under our laws, we ought not to omit any precaution or safeguard for the revenue. </para>

                    <para>-I should like to point out, with all respect and deference to that "model State," South Australia, that the Customs Act of the States which is the most recent, and the best brought up to date, is that of Tasmania ; and it is a curious fact that the provision which the House of Representatives has insisted upon is to be found in the Customs Acts of every State except Tasmania. The reason is that Tasmania has brought its Customs Act up to the furthest state of perfection. The question now raised is a practical one. It is simply as to whether the Government will compel the owner of goods exported to give a certificate and to guarantee that they shall be landed at a port outside the Commonwealth, or whether they will compel the master of the ship to do so. The question was fully discussed when the Bill was last before honorable senators, and the objection then taken to it still holds good - that if it is in force it will practically ask the owner of the goods to do what he cannot possibly succeed in doing. He will be asked to give a certificate as to a matter of which he has no knowledge, whereas the master of the ship is the person in whose custody the goods are, and who can best give a certificate as to the port at which they will be landed. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has endeavoured to make out a strong case by asking what is going to happen if the goods are not landed in the place where they are supposed to be landed. But clause 121 contains all that is necessary, as it was left by the Senate in the Bill. Under that clause the Government can, if they like, insist upon the owner - although it is my contention that they ought not to insist upon such a thing - producing a certificate as to the landing of the goods; and this can be done, although the owner will probably never even travel with them to England or any other country where they are to be landed. Every provision is made in clause 121 for securing what the Government want. The Collector of Customs may demand a certificate from the owner or from any one else concerned with the goods. Therefore I contend that this provision is totally unnecessary, and that it is quite unnecessary that we should restore the words the excision of which has been objected to by the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that, but the Vice-President of the Executive Council will also recognise the fact that, if such a certificate is not satisfactory, the Government will have power to take other steps. It is a practical difficulty that is involved in the clause. The Vice-President knows that in the Acts where this provision has been inserted it is practically a deadletter. </para>

                    (Western Australia).The committee might, I think, very well agree no to insist upon the amendment which has been disagreed with by the House of Representatives. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out, it is an optional power to place in the hands of the Collector of Customs. I can quite understand that there might be occasions on -which it would not be necessary for the collector to exercise the power. For instance, I should think that the collector would never ask for such security to be given in the case of a line of vessels which he knew was trading to foreign ports. But in the case of coasting vessels of smaller capacity, which might be loaded with goods as to which, in the opinion of the collector, there was grave suspicion that they were to be landed at some port in Australia, he might require something in the nature of a security, so that if the law was broken the Customs might get some tangible compensation for the breach of the law.
                    says that the Customs officers themselves will prevent the goods being smuggled. But it may be made to appear that the goods are being carried as part of the Inter-State trade, and are not being landed from some foreign port to a part of the Commonwealth. In that case it might be possible for the duty to be evaded. Under all the circumstances, the committee might very well agree not to insist upon this amendment.

                        <para>- I find that by clause 119 the master of every ship has to account to the satisfaction of the collector for any goods specified or referred to in the outward manifest, and not on board his ship under a penalty of £50, but I think there is another clause of an even more severe character than that. At all events there are very severe penalties attached to the master and owner of a ship, and they ought to be sufficient. </para>

                    (Tasmania).- The "Vice-President in the last few remarks he made has given an excellent reason for insisting upon our amendment. It seems to me that it is now beyond any doubt that if an offence were committed against the clause as it originally stood, the ship would be guilty of smuggling, and would be liable to forfeiture under clause 219. The word " smuggling " is defined to mean the introduction of goods with intent to defraud the revenue. If a ship did bring back goods which had been exported, it would be with intent to defraud the revenue, and she would be forfeited. What greater penalty do we want? It has been regarded as a reason why we should accept the amendment that it is a usual arid customary thing in legislation throughout the Commonwealth. In English legislation there is no such provision. On the contrary, it is almost exactly on all fours with the clause as it was amended here. "With all due respect to the transcendent ability which exists in the other House, I think it is fail- to predicate equal ability and equal knowledge of customs matters in the House of Commons.

I do not suppose it would be an ordinary practice, because a man who did it would risk certain other penalties. A great deal of ingenuity is devoted sometimes to evading the Customs Act, and it is not unreasonable that this power should be given to the collector, not to be used at all times, as is the case in five States out of six, but to be used at any time he may think advisable. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - It was stated by
                    that we ought to beware how it went forth that the Commonwealth was going to be more lax in dealing with these matters than the States had been. It is evident to me that he overlooked a very great change which the federation has brought about in the commercial relations between the States. The possibility .of illicitly landing goods which have been sent away is very great as between State and State, but it is very little as between Australia and the rest of the world. If the Minister recognised that great fact, I do not think he would contend for these words, which in my opinion are quite unnecessary. I shall give an illustration of the changed position. Within the last three or four hours, the Treasurer told me that the drawback department in Victoria would be practically wiped out by the uniform Tariff, and about 24 officers would be available to be sent to other places to do work where it might be increased. The clanger which has been aimed at in State by State is almost wiped out under federation.

                        <para>- If, in the case of the English Act, some wider degree of security is requisite, it is because of circumstances, which, in regard to Australia, are now mostly things of the past. Australia is under the Commonwealth a united country. Goods cannot be sent from Australia unless they are exports ; and if they are exports they are not to be landed in any other part of Australia. The danger which this clause is aimed at is therefore quite illusory. I hope the committee will adhere to its former resolution. </para>

                        <para>- That has not been proved, at any rate. It is only right and proper that the Collector of Customs should have very large powers for the purpose of enforcing honesty on the part of traders. There is no trouble whatever about the honest man ; the difficulty is with the evader. An honest man rarely finds himself in trouble. As this provision has been in force in five different States for many years past without any apparent inconvenience; as it is only permissive, and not obligatory, so far as the Customs department and the collector are concerned ; and as we are assured that the collector will never enforce it unless there are strong reasons for suspicion, I think it desirable not to insist upon the amendment. Another reason is that we ought not to split straws in regard to amendments. If we can see our way to agree with the House of Representatives, we should do so. Another place has agreed with many of the amendments made by the Senate, and we should meet them as far as possible. </para>

It ought not to be allowed to go forth to the world that the Customs Act of the Commonwealth is any less stringent than other Customs Acts, and that we are opening our doors to fraud and omitting punishments which have been used hitherto by the State authorities. This clause really follows exactly the same principle as the State legislation. The collector in this case is the party to ask for a certificate. In the case of the previous clause there was a guarantee required. Here the clause is only to be applied in particular cases when required by the collector, and it will be a very great protection against fraud. I move - </para>

Let me tell him that I was engaged in the commerce of Sydney before he became an adept in the proceedings of police courts. I do not tell the honorable and learned senator that he does not understand the profession he practices, and let him extend the same courtesy to me. He does not, however, understand what he is talking about here, for he knows as much about commerce as a cow does about conic sections. A person who pays the penalty for an offence is supposed under the British law to be purged of that offence, and is not required to bear it all the days of his life. This clause is framed upon exactly the opposite idea. I do not think it is a desirable clause, but the Senate has decided by a large majority to go back upon itself in one provision of a somewhat similar type. We might therefore just as well give up this amendment also and let the majority have their way, contenting ourselves with dissenting from an unusual and, in my view, obnoxious provision. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out what can happen, and that until goods have been exported the owner has no right to have this drawback paid. The Customhouse authorities are entitled to have the best possible security that the goods have been exported, and therefore we require that a declaration shall be made. There is no objection on the part of the Senate to a declaration being made, but honorable senators have decided that it shall be a declaration, not that the goods have not been, or are not intended to be relanded, but that they have not been landed to the knowledge of the party claiming the drawback. With a qualification of that kind, this declaration is really valueless. The owner of the goods may take very good care when he is making the declaration to know nothing whatever about whether they have been relanded or not, and it is very difficult, indeed, to prove that he does not know anything about it. If the clause remains as the Senate passed it, we shall have to show knowledge on the part of the person making the declaration and claiming the drawback, and to prove knowledge in a case of the sort is the most difficult thing in the world. On the other hand, if a person is bound to make a declaration that as a matter of fact the goods have been exported, have not been relanded. or are not intended to be relanded, that is a matter entirely within his own knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- Because he can ascertain whether the goods have or have not been relanded at the time he makes the declaration, lt might be supposed from the arguments used that this was some new invention never heard of before, but it is a provision which is to be found in every Customs Act, and it is looked upon as a necessary safeguard. The clause with the qualification suggested would practically be of no use whatever. In the case of the honest trader there is no hardship upon him, and if a man is not honest, with the amendment adopted by the Senate, there would be no safeguard whatever, because, in order to prove that he made a false declaration, we should have to prove what was in the mind of the person making the declaration at the time, which would be impossible. Under the circumstances, if we are to have any solid benefit from the safeguard provided under the clause at all, these words ought to be omitted. I therefore move - </para>

To ask an exporter to positively declare that the goods he shipped have not been re-landed, when he can have no personal knowledge, is a monstrous thing. Practically it requires a shipper to declare a lie. I protest against its enactment. It is an unfair position for the committee to place exporters in. I know that exporters have protested time and again against being placed in that pos&gt; tion, and that a number of them have refused to make these declarations. </para>

                        <para>- That part was left out. The section I have read is exactly what the House of Representatives wishes to have in this Bill. In section 156 of the Victorian Act there is no limitation as to his knowledge ; but there is a statutory declaration to be made that the goods mentioned have been actually .exported, and have not been, and are not intended, to be relanded in any part of Victoria. And in the law of Western Australia there is exactly the same provision. Under these circumstances, the question arises - Are we to give up a safeguard which other States, and which England, have been insisting upon ? I submit that the clause ought to be left as it is in the original Bill. </para>

                    NEILD (New South Wales). - Surely the Minister can see that there is a wide distinction between the circumstances of a comparatively few miles of coast line and the great coast line of the Commonwealth. Taking the case of Western Australia, or even the case of Victoria, surely only a few hours are required for a vessel with dutiable goods on board to reach her destination ; but there is a totally different state of affairs existing in the Commonwealth where a vessel will take goods and traverse thousands of miles of coast line, entering various ports
                    and possibly taking at least ten days to a fortnight to accomplish her voyage. At intervals during that period, the vessel being in port, goods may be re-landed unintenth,. I shall take the case of wrong goods being put ashore, as witness the case of the boiler in Western Australia, which was quoted. The owner must absolutely swear that the goods have not been re-landed, otherwise he cannot get his drawback. I thought that when we came to constitute a great dependency we were to make some advance, and not necessarily,as
                    seems to think desirable, go back 30 or 40 years for a musty precedent at the other end of the world. It is one of those cases where it is desirable, in the interests of truth, that the owner of goods should not be compelled to swear to a thing which he does not know anything of. To compel persons to make these extravagantly positive statements, not knowing whether they are facts or not, is calculated to weaken a man's respect for the declarations which he is required to make under the provisions of the Bill. If you make a man reckless, you absolutely invite him to propagate falsehoods. I do not think the House of Representatives, over this point, would take the course which
                    suggests. Surely there would not be a conflict between the two Houses over three words which are in the manifest interest of veracity. I do not think, if it came to a conference, there is any reason why we should shrink from maintaining that which we believe to be honorable and right. I do not know that a conference would have any .bad effect. There will be a conference between the two Houses some day, and perhaps if we had a conference or two it would tend to a better understanding between us, if that were possible, than exists. For these reasons I urge that the motion be not agreed to.

                        <para>- I am not thin-skinned at all, but I think that remarks of that sort are very much to be deprecated when we are considering amendments of this character. It is our duty to consider them, not from the point of view of either promoting unfriendly relations with the other House, or of altogether putting aside the possibility of such disagreement, but from the desire - as has been recognised by the representatives of the Government in this Chamber - to do our duty to the public. We ought to insist upon them unless we are convinced to the contrary. I do not think I was in the chamber when this particular amendment was dealt with, but I believe that considerable debate arose upon it. </para>

                    (New South Wales. - The explanation has partly mixed up
                    with myself. If I understand it correctly,
                    made the statement that
                    and myself were acting in the interests of some big firms in Sydney, and when that was questioned he said that
                    had told him so. It would appear that
                    was not speaking on his own responsibility, but upon that of
                    explanation is that a man may say anything in his name, and he will afterwards explain it away. With regard to some remarks of
                    the honorable and learned senator must have misunderstood what I said in the first instance. I pointed out that we should not as a Senate immediately turn round and swallow our deliberately expressed opinions unless good reason be shown why we should do so. The fact that another place disagrees with our amendment is not, in my opinion, any good reason why we should abandon the amendment. If our amendments are of such a character that we feel impelled to stand by them, the House of Representatives will probably be prepared to give our position fair consideration, and may fall in with what we wish to see carried out. When the honorable senator says it would be ridiculous to bring about trouble or delay in connexion with this Bill for the sake of two or three unimportant words, I cordially agree with him ; but directly we come to deal with a matter of real importance we ought not to give up our deliberate convictions simply because to stand by them may cause some delay in the passage of a measure. Were we to legislate in that way the usefulness of the Senate would be gone, and the talk about the Senate being strong and determined would be only so much moonshine.

                    (New South Wales.)I am inclined to think that whether the words are inserted or left out will make very little difference in practice.
                    has shown that practically the power will be there whether we put the words in or not. He told us that every declaration would be assumed to have been made to the best knowledge and belief of the deponent. If that is so, why not put the words in? If
                    statement is correct, as I think it is, what becomes of the assertion of
                    that unless the words are left out the door will be left open for fraud? Supposing any one made the declaration required under this Bill, and it was afterwards found that the goods had been landed again, is there any jury in Australia that would find that man guilty of perjury, unless it could be proved that he had a knowledge?
                    statement was that a man claiming drawback should offer evidence that the goods had not been relanded, or that it was not intended to re-land them ; but I ask
                    as a lawyer, whether he would accept as evidence a statement from me or from any one else about a matter upon which we could not possibly know anything. If I attempted to speak with respect to goods the possession of which had passed beyond my control,
                    would say at once that that was not evidence.

                    (New South Wales). - In support of this matter the English practice has been quoted by Ministers, and I desire to point out that this clause in the English Act is substantially obsolete, because the English Tariff, as we all know, is practically confined to intoxicants and narcotics, and under the Act they are excluded from drawback. Under clause 161 of this Bill drawback will not be allowed upon spirits, wine, beer, tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, or opium. The English Tariff is practically confined to those articles, and as there is no drawback on them the clause which has been relied upon in the English Act is practically obsolete.

                    <para>- It has often been said that this is a strong Senate. I think there is a risk of the Chamber earning the title of " a strong Senate of weak senators," because it seems to me it would be almost impossible for a Chamber, which spent weeks in deliberating, and in arriving at certain conclusions, to display more abject obedience to dictation from another place to go back on itself, and show that those weeks were misspent, and that it went astray. </para>

                        <para>- It is astonishing how, when I want to make a very small fire, the Postmaster-General supplies me with enough fuel for a big conflagration. Why do we pass amendments if the instant we are told that somebody somewhere else disagrees with them, we are in abject haste to fall in with the swish of the cane and obediently come to heel ? That seems to me about the position the Senate is placing itself in, and the House of Representatives will be perfectly entitled to consider that the Senate does not intend to stand by any amendment which is subsequently disagreed with, because, so far, those who have sought to maintain the position which it had taken up have been beaten by two votes to one. If that is the good will of the Senate, I necessarily bow to it, and I only regret that there is not a little more backbone in a House which started its career with so great a flourish of trumpets, putting forth in such ornate and strong phraseology its splendid strength, which now appears to me "to be made perfect in weakness." </para>

                        <para>- This clause says first of all that the goods shall be forfeited in the event of any entry, invoice, declaration, answer, statement, or representation being false. I entirely agree that an offence of that sort should be punished, but when it goes on to use the words "misleading in any particular," it is too sweeping. It is not at all infrequent in some trades for the invoices to come without importers knowing what the goods are. We have a general idea, but until they are opened we do not know what they are. </para>

                    <para>- I sincerely hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will stick to his ground upon this point. Up to the present we have not found it necessary to disagree with the other place, and it would be a pity to raise further trouble, and take up time by making amendments which would only delay matters. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must see that many of these provisions are necessarily inserted for the protection of the revenue. I have mentioned these matters to show that those honorable senators who speak of an intention to mislead, and introduce the moral element, are speaking beside the question. We are not dealing with what is in a man's mind at all. I hope the committee will take the view that it is in the interests of the honest trader and of the revenue to leave the clause as it came to the Senate originally. </para>

It is merely a case of a particular section of an Act of Parliament being offended against by an individual. When this matter was previously before the Senate I find that the amendment was made in the clause without very much debate.

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I shall vote in favour of insisting on the amendment made by the Senate. The amendment is for the insertion of the word " wilfully " before the word " misleading." There is a wide distinction between false and misleading. " False " expresses an element of guilt in the mind, but "misleading" may be applied to something of a most innocent character. The word "false " is a very strong one, but the word "misleading" is a mild term, and, as a rule, expresses innocence. It seems to me that we should do well to retain the word " wilfully," as intimating the absence of guilt in the misleading point contained in the invoice or answer. The word " false " only qualifies the word " misleading," and embodies in it that element of guiltiness which surely should be essential to warrant the forfeiture of the goods.

                <para>
                    (South Australia). -I wish to point out to
                    that " wilfully misleading " is just equivalent to false. If we put the word " wilfully" before the word "misleading," we are simply inserting in the clause a repetition of two terms which mean exactly the same. I do not believe that any one will suppose there is any difference between a wilfully misleading statement and a false statement. One is the same as the other. I shall vote for
                    proposal, with a view to giving as little trouble as possible to the Customs. Look also at the delay which will be caused. Every one is wanting to have the Tariff announced, and for the purpose of inserting something winch is really there already, we are going to delay the passage of this Bill for nearly a week. 1 hope honorable senators will vote for the motion.

                    <para>- I have been assisting the Government all the afternoon' to get this Bill through, but I am afraid I cannot assist them in this matter. There is a very strong case for the forfeiture of goods, where a person has prepared an invoice or made a declaration which is false. Where an invoice is wilfully misleading, and there appears to be a clear attempt to deceive the Customs authorities and evade the duties, the person guilty should be treated in the same way as one who makes an absolutely false declaration. But where a man just rnakes an unintentional mistake, to forfeit his goods is going a great deal beyond what I think the justice of the case requires. I cannot, therefore, support the Vice-President of the Executive Council in the motion he has submitted with respect to this amendment. </para>

I am not at all swayed by the fact that we are going to delay the announcement of the Tariff. I think we should put principles of justice before the delay of any measure. All that is necessary in the clause is covered by the word "false." Eoi* the reasons I have given, I shall support the committee in insisting on this amendment. </para>

Inasmuch as it is more important, to bring one particular criminal to justice, to follow out certain, principles in the administration of the criminal law, it is not desirable to compel him to give evidence ; but when we are dealing with the recovery of money there is really no reason why we should not proceed in this way. </para>

                        <para>- As a means of recovering the money, but not as a punishment. If an imprisonment is to follow a summary prosecution, then the case cannot come under this provision ; but if there is a right to imprison in order to recover a fine, it can come under it, because there the main object of the prosecution is to recover money, and the imprisonment is a remedy only, just as the sale of a man's goods is a remedy. If we do not amend the Bill as I suggest, then if a man is proceeded against to recover a penalty of £500 the action is brought in a court in the ordinary way, and we can compel him to give evidence there. But if he is brought before a magistrate, and it is a matter of summary conviction - if it is what we may call a prosecution - he cannot be compelled to give evidence. There is no meaning in a distinction of that kind. Let me point out the necessity of having the power to compel the man to give evidence. In very many cases the question of whether a man ought or ought not to pay a fine or a penalty will depend upon information which he alone can give. "We may call upon him to produce his books. The question of values may depend entirely on his books. "We may want to show that he has been guilty of some misrepresentation in regard to some invoices of the value of goods. If we get him to produce his books we can put them in evidence ; but it may be that without his explanation of what certain items mean they are absolutely unintelligible to the court to prove either his guilt or his innocence, or to prove whether he ought or ought not to pay the money. Would it not be monstrous if we were not able to call upon him to answer a question which would clear up a mystery which might arise from his books, and which he alone could explain? That is the reason why in the Customs Acts of other countries the law is as I have said it ought to be here - that is to say, that the defendant is not only competent, but compellable to give evidence. </para>

                    <para>- I spent a little time this morning in going through the Senate's amendments and the amendments of another place thereon, and I came to the conclusion that if this committee accepted all the amendments which that other place had made, the Bill would be made more workable and more statesmanlike. I have sat dumb here for about six hours, and I have marvelled at the eloquence of my- honorable friends opposite as to many clauses, which are purely machinery. I tremble to think of what their eloquence will be when we get to the Tariff. Another place has, in my opinion, done perfectly right in disagreeing with the omission of the second part of this clause. Honorable senators seem to forget that whenever this clause is put into effect something like a judicial proceeding takes place. An importer goes to the Custom-house with his entry and he makes a declaration, and upon these documents he gets away his goods. It is afterwards found either that he has got the goods away improperly and unlawfully, or that he has got them "away by paying less duty than the law requires. I marvelled when I heard honorable senators contending - with a knowledge of the law, too - that a man ought not to be cross-examined on what practically is in his own statement. </para>

The committee, for instance, might insist upon the amendment, and we might take a division upon that, when, if the division was adverse to the view I take, no doubt the amendment as now proposed would be carried on the voices.
