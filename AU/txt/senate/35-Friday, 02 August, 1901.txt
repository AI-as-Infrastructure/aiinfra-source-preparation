                    <para>. - I fully recognise the importance of this subject, and no one more than myself desires that the gentleman who may be appointed to the office of High Commissioner shall be in every way worthy of the eminent position which he will occupy. But in considering this matter we have to forecast the action which is likely to be taken by the various States of the Commonwealth. It is assumed - at all events in some quarters - that as soon as the High Commissioner is appointed the present Agents-General for the various States will be withdrawn. I am not at all sure that such will be the case. I think it is exceedingly probable that many of the States will retain their Agents-General in London, and in that case their positions will be of a somewhat different character to what they have been hitherto. In times past it was customary to appoint as Agent-General a gentleman who was perhaps more prominent in the political than in the commercial world. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. Surely the words " to act as the resident agent of the Dominion in the United Kingdom, and in that capacity to execute such powers and perform such duties as may from time to time be conferred upon or assigned to him by the Governor-General in Council," are wide enough to cover everything. No doubt in selecting a gentleman to occupy this high position the Executive will be guided by considerations similar to those which have influenced the Government of Canada. In making such a selection they should not be hampered in any way in their choice. I do not deprecate this discussion. I can see no harm, and perhaps there is some good, in honorable senators expressing their opinions in regard to the qualifications which should "be possessed by the gentleman chosen, to occupy the position of High Commissioner But it is undesirable at this stage to emphasize in such a way the qualifications in connexion with the producing and commercial interests as to indicate that we consider that those particular qualifications are of supreme importance. So long as the States continue to be represented by Agents General who are particularly charged with the duty of looking after those interests, the High Commissioner, above all things, should be possessed of qualities which will enable him tq ably represent the great Commonwealth of Australia amongst the diplomatists from all parts of the world. </para>

                    <para>- I did not intend to take any part in this discussion, but after listening to the conclud-ing remarks of the Postmaster-General, the position does not appear to me to be at all reassuring. The Postmaster-General seems to think that the High Commissioner in London should be a diplomatist and not a commercial agent. He founds his conclusion upon the presumption that the States themselves will look after their commercial interests, and that the region of high diplomacy will be reserved to the Commonwealth. I know that in the States the idea is very largely held that the offices of the Agents General should be abolished, and that one common agent should be appointed for all the States. </para>

                        <para>- I think that it is quite time enough to deal with those questions when they arise. My opinion is that we have a territory which is quite large enough for us to manage. Our principal duty is to devote all our attention to its development. Let other countries mind their own business, and let us mind ours. In all the States, I believe almost without exception, the appointments to the office of Agent-General have not been made because of any special qualification which a person might have; but for a political reason. It was desirable to get rid, perhaps, of a member of the Ministry who had outlived his usefulness, and was becoming unpopular. Younger men were desirous of pushing him out of the way so that they might fill his shoes, and accordingly he was appointed Agent-General and shunted off to London. His qualifications for the position were never, or very rarely, taken into consideration. I do not wish to say that on all occasions the persons who were appointed were not qualified. I do not think it is possible for any man to take an active part in politics for a number of years without becoming more or less well-qualified to fill a position such as that of Agent-General. At the same time I maintain that in our commercial circles, in our producing circles, men who never have taken any prominent part in politics might be found, and I believe would be found, whose capacity for filling efficiently a portion of this character would be much greater than the capacity of any men who had given up a large portion of his time and attention to mere politics. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that any honorable senators who object to this motion can only do so. on the supposition that it is impossible for any man to combine within himself the finer qualities necessary for a successful diplomatist and practical knowledge and experience such as are indicated in the motion. I think that every Australian, whether by birth or adoption, should agree to this motion, and I certainly cannot see that there would be any harm in our giving expression to our opinion. We all agree with the greater part of what the Postmaster-General has said as to its being necessary to have a gentleman who will make a successful diplomatist, but the Postmaster-General must also agree with us that it will be equally necessary to have a gentleman with experience of . Australian affairs, and who will be, like many of us here, an Australian first and an Imperialist afterwards. </para>

Great regard should be paid to the necessity of having a High Commissioner possessing an intimate knowledge of Australian political interests, who should also be a person calculated to attract notice by his personality, accomplishments, and acquirements, in his communications with the statesmen of the. old world. If we can find a person possessing all these attributes, who is also connected with industrial and commercial interests, we shall be able to make a very good appointment. </para>

Why, however, should, we pass over a man who may be eminently fitted in every other respect, merely because he cannot say that he is connected \vith the producing and commercial interests of the Commonwealth. It is only right that we should leave the matter open, simply expressing the opinion that it is desirable that the High Commissioner should know something of, the commercial and producing interests, 'without making a want of knowledge on these subjects an absolute bar to appointment. </para>

                        <para>- It might be desirable if he did. Still, I do not think we should appoint a person qualified commercially, and unqualified in other respects, in preference to one who is qualified in all other respects, but has only an imperfect knowledge of our commercial and producing interests. I quite agree with other honorable senators that the High Commissioner should answer to the general description of an Australian - not that he should be born here, but that he should be a person who has absorbed Australian concerns into his mind, who understands the state of feeling here, and who is an Australian in sentiment. But I would leave it open to the Government to select the person who possesses most of the attributes necessary to make his occupancy of the office successful and advantageous to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I know that it is a difficult matter, but if we have a man in these States who has won his spurs in the Parliament, he ought not to be tabooed because he does not possess an intimate- knowledge of the commercial and producing interests. What would many of the men coming from Western Australia know of the Victorian butter industry, for example? Whatever complexion this resolution takes, we shall have to fall back upon the fact, that while the High Commissioner will preside over the interests of the whole of the States, we shall require a general agent to look after their commercial interests. </para>

                    <para>That, in the opinion of this Senate, the Government should forthwith acquire for the Commonwealth the ownership and control of the Bass Straits submarine telegraph cable. </para>

                <para>I pointed out on a previous occasion the peculiar position in which the people on both sides of Bass Straits are placed with regard to telegraphic communication. I think I cannot better illustrate the point than by giving a practical instance. What I am saying with regard to messages despatched from Tasmania to the mainland would apply with equal force to messages despatched from the mainland to Tasmania. An ordinary message coming from the south of Tasmania to the north, and going no further, would cost for ten words1s., the whole of which sum goes into the consolidated revenue of Tasmania. </para>

                    <para>And shall also be entitled to obtain and have the exclusive use of the said submarine telegraph upon giving reasonable notice to the company their successors or assigns and upon payment to them of an amount equivalent to the cost of the line and the value of the profits thereof, including the Government guarantee, the same to be determined in case of difference by the arbitration of disinterested persons. </para>

                <para>When the term under that agreement had nearly expired, the Tasmanian Government entered into another agreement, in 1889, with the Eastern Extension Company. That second agreement modified the previous one to this extent - that after the twenty years the right to exclusive communication was extended for a further twenty years to date from the' expiring of the " current twenty years." The subsidy of £4, 200 was specifically continued, but in this supplementary agreement all the net profits were to go to the company ; so that even if the company earned more than 10 per cent, there was no refund to the Government. The Government, however, had power to reduce the rates, the company taking a portion of the "message receipts," the Government guaranteeing the message receipts up to the amount of £5,600 per annum, in addition to the subsidy. Moreover, in addition to that the position of the company was that its instruments were to be free from duty and wharfage, and its ships from port duties whilst its property was to be free from taxation. So that in addition to their subsidy of £4,200 a year, in case the Government reduced the rates the company were to have another £5,600 a year absolutely guaranteed to them. That was, be it remembered, on a construction cost of £70,000 per annum. The company consequently had an assured income of £9,800 per annum, or 14 per cent. Altogether this company, so far as concerns the telegraphy of Australia, was in a very fair way to do a good thing for itself. Now the Commonwealth has power, as the representative of Tasmania, or Tasmania has power, as a part of the Commonwealth, to acquire possession of this cable, as laid down in the original agreement. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; the words are, at an "amount equivalent to the cost of the line and the value of the profits thereof." The second agreement modified the original agreement, but did not modify the provision with regard to the Government acquiring possession. That power of acquiring is vested in the Government of the Commonwealth directly, or indirectly in the Government of Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- lt would not cost the Government any more than it is costing them now, and they would have the control, which would be an immense advantage. I think I may again refer briefly to a point I endeavoured to make in my opening remarks. If a' telegram were sent from Melbourne, say, to Flinders, it would cost 9d. ; it would not go out of the State and the Treasury of Victoria would get the full benefit. But if a telegram were sent from Wodonga through Flinders to Tasmania it would be interrupted here and have to go upon different lines. It would go over a much longer distance and through the hands of a greater number of officers, and require the attention of a greater number of per- sons, and yet the State would actually get less, because this company has to take its toll of ls. If I send a telegram in Tasmania from Launceston to Georgetown, for instance, where the company has its office, the Government gets the full benefit of the ls. paid for the ten words, but if an individual went down to the other end of Tasmania, and sent a telegram from Southport to Melbourne, it would have to go from Southport to Hobart, then to Launceston to Georgetown and Melbourne, and for the same number of words 2s. would be paid ; and yet the Government of Tasmania and the Government of Victoria would only get 6d. each and the company would get ls. That has been the practice in the past. </para>

                        <para>- Until 1909. If this, line were part of the system of the Commonwealth, the ls. now paid to the company would not be diverted from the Treasury at all. The whole message costs 2s., of which each State gets 6d. and the private company gets ls. This is a matter which must be considered in any inquiry as to whether the taking over of the line by the Commonwealth would be a paying venture. I may point out also that by reason of the fact that the whole system on the mainland of the Commonwealth is now in the control of the Postmaster-General, the people in Queensland and the people in Western Australia and other distant States are now allowed to participate in an advantage which they could never have derived but for that amalgamation. The telegrams now sent to the press with regard to the proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament are sent from here to Western Australia or from here to Queensland on the same terms as they are sent to the country press in Victoria. </para>

AVe, in Tasmania, although we are not nearly so far away, cannot do that, because this company has to be considered. Questions have been asked of the representatives of the Government in this Chamber and in another place with regard to this very matter, and it has been pointed out -that, owing to the existence of this company, the uniform rates which have been fixed cannot apply to Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- We are put into this isolated position to which I have referred. I move this motion to draw attention to what I consider is, and will remain, an anomaly with regard to our telegraphic system, unless some action is taken by the Government as early as possible. I do it, believing strongly in the principle affirmed by the Postmaster-General here,&gt; and which I think has received the concurrence of all honorable senators of this Chamber, 'that the control of communication, both by post and telegraph, throughout the whole of the Commonwealth should be the absolute monopoly of the people of the Commonwealth. In order to give proper application to that principle, it is eminently necessary that this connecting link between the telegraphic system of one of the States and of the other States, should- be controlled and owned by the people of the Commonwealth. This, as I have pointed out before, is entirely dissimilar from an ocean cable going to the outside world. It is connecting the State with the Common wealth, and it cannot be pretended that the arguments I have used with regard to the necessity for this purchase might be applied with force to the purchase of a cable line from Australia to America or any outlying countries. This is within the Commonwealth itself and a part of our system, and until it is purchased we in Tasmania must necessarily labour under the disadvantages to which I have referred, and must put up -with the anomalies I have mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- Under the terms of that agreement I have no doubt Tasmania would be precluded from granting even landing rights to any other company. So that this company has placed itself in the position, that it has got an absolute monopoly of the telegraphic communication between Tasmania and the mainland of Australia. That is one condition of the agreement, and there is another with regard to the terms upon which this cable may be acquired by the State of Tasmania, the terms being the payment of the cost of construction, £70,000, and interest upon the profits and upon the Government guarantee. . The term of the first agreement has expired, and a second agreement has taken its place for another twenty years, without making any alteration in that purchase clause. The consequence is that the company are in a position to say that the cable cannot be acquired unles"s we pay them the original cost of construction and interest upon the profits and the Government guarantee. Honorable senators will mark the fact that a submarine cable does not last for ever, like an Eastern Extension Company's agreement. It has a certain life. Very often the process of deterioration goes on without any defect becoming apparent, until some day or other the cable stops. That is provided for in the agreement. It is provided that the cable may cease working for a certain number of days. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. What is contemplated is this : The cable is getting older and older. Nobody knows when it is going to give out, and it may at any time break down and be found to be past repair. We are placed in this position under the agreements that exist, that the only way in which we can compulsorily acquire the cable is by giving the company the full cost of the original construction and interest upon present profits and Government guarantees, the cable having been continually deteriorating, while the profits have been continually increasing. Under such circumstances, if it were considered desirable that the Commonwealth should acquire .this cable, it should be a matter of fair negotiation. That is the reason why I deprecated the moving of this motion, because it seems to me to be in the direction of tying up the hands of one of the contracting parties. If we desire to acquire the cable, it is' open now to the Government to enter into negotiations with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company for its purchase. </para>

                        <para>- I have been leading up to that point. I have pointed out, first of all, that they have carefully arranged that they shall have no competition - -they have a monopoly. They have arranged the terms on which a purchase may be made. They renewed an agreement after the first twenty years had nearly elapsed, providing that the original cost shall be paid for a cable which has lain under the. sea for twenty years, and that interest shall be paid on profits which have been constantly increasing. And now we have a motion, which, if passed, would strengthen their hands, because it declares that we shall forth with purchase the cable. It it were passed, and it had any effect, it would simply mean that, we should be bound - instead of negotiating' with the company, and finding out fit what price they were willing to sell the cable and! allow it to come under State control - to pay them the price which is mentioned in the agreement. - </para>

                        <para>- There is no connexion between the two things. The reason of the objection' to the alteration I am at a loss to discover, because whether it be for a specified time or for the whole term, there can be no harm in putting on the notice-paper what every one knows to be the fact. As the notice appears, in print, the ground of the application is the urgency of private business. That appears there because it. is the stereotyped form. The reason of the application, is the pendency of this petition, and the fact that some honorable senators think that it should be for a specific period can in no reasonable way influence them in objecting to having it amended so as to make the words conformable with what they know to be the fact. That objection coming from the Postmaster-General is an unfortunate thing, because this petition has undoubtedly given rise to a good deal of ill-feeling already, and that ill-feeling is not lessened by a factious and unreasonable objection for which no ground can be shown. </para>

                        <para>- No. Not as a member of the Senate. My honorable friend has no right to make the suggestion that it will .cause delay in any shape or form. That is for the committee to deal with. It has been handed over to the committee, and they are to deal with it as they best can. My honorable friend is throwing a reflection by anticipation upon the committee of which I have the honour to be a member. </para>

                        <para>- I can see excellent reasons why this leave of absence should be granted, and I can see no reason why the Postmaster-General should raise any objection to it. The reason we ask for an indefinite time is that it is not desired that a motion should be brought on every month asking for leave of absence, when it would be brought up in the papers, and therefore the motion asks that the leave of absence shall be for the remainder of the session. </para>
