                        <para>- The clause could be very much better, and just as briefly, dealt with in committee, and it is not from any antagonistic desire, but with the view of enabling my honorable and learned friend to explain the effect of the clause, which is giving very great concern in. some of the States, that I take this course. I am quite prepared to state shortly what the points are that are creating this feeling of uneasiness, and, I may say, of disappointment. I am very sorry that I did not notice the full effect of the clause at the time it was introduced after a very brief discussion on Friday last, but I had not then in my hand the illustrative figures which were circulated in the Senate, and which showed in a concrete form what the effect of it would be. It is only right that we should clearly apprehend what may be done under the clause before the Bill leaves the Senate. We have, under the obligations of the Commonwealth, been placed in the position of acquiring the property which appertains to what are called the transferred services. That property is of very considerable value, and has been assessed, as the statement shows, at very high figures indeed. </para>

                        <para>- The liability is there. The Commonwealth charges the State in its books. The Commonwealth will not pay money to New South Wales for its properties, or take over a portion of debt to the value of the property, but will -charge the State with this £588,000 of liability. Undoubtedly that is a liability to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will leave the balance unpaid. "What is going to be done with it ? Is it going to remain a debt due by the State ? </para>

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend puts the matter with great politeness, but I desire to understand it, and that is why I am raising the point. Whilst we, representing the States, expected that our States would either get cash for the properties they handed over, or be relieved of an equivalent portion of their debts, neither one thing nor the other is to happen up to a certain amount. Tasmania is to get nothing ; New South Wales is to get nothing ; Victoria is to get nothing ; and Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia are to get only a fractional part of the compensation due to them in respect of the properties they hand over. My honorable and learned friend says that that is not due to this clause. I' am unable to see anything in the Constitution which would bring about such a disappointing state of things as that would be to the respective States. There is nothing whatever in the Constitution which says that whenever the Common wealth spends £1,000,000 of money in respect of capital expenditure, the liability is to be borne by each State proportionately. That would destroy the whole benefit of federation. </para>

The Commonwealth has been intrusted by the Constitution with the collection of the whole of the customs duties of the States, and it holds the money so collected in trust to apply in a particular way. The mode of application is laid down in section 89. I may mention parenthetically that section 93 carries the provisions of section 89 beyond the period of the uniform tariff. I need not further trouble with that section, as it has only that operation. Section 89 is the one we have to deal with. The whole of the proceeds of these customs duties being in the hands of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth has to apply the money as laid down in section 89. And it is to be done in this way. </para>

                        <para>- No. If the Commonwealth pays the whole amount over to Tasmania in cash, then Tasmania will have to pay back her share. If she pays back at once well and good ; if she does not, then the amount may be charged against her, month by month, or in any way the Commonwealth thinks fit. It is a mere question of accounts and how they are to be kept. Tha object of this clause is not to - impose any new liability, but simply to enable the Treasurer to do what any other business man would do. When he finds that he has to pay a certain amount over to a State, and that that State has to bo debited with a certain amount, then he strikes off that which is common to the entries on both sides and settles for the balance. I see no reason why the principles I have enunciated should not be followed out with the most perfect justice and. with the preservation of all the rights which the States now possess. Instead of compelling the Commonwealth to find at once the very large sum - estimated at nearly £10,500,000 - for the purpose of paying compensation, when a large sum has to be deducted, the Commonwealth would only ha-ve to raise £1,607,000, according to my illustration, either by loan or in some other way, and pay the States. </para>

                        <para>- Take the case of South Australia. The amount payable to her would be £1,665,000. That could be paid in several ways. We could take over the State debts to that amount without applying this deduction at all. If we did not do that, then we would apply the set-off provision. After allowing for the set-off, the amount to be paid to South Australia would be £790,000, and we would take over debts to that extent instead of the former amount. It is as broad as it is long. As it is, we do not do that ; we carry out the proposal suggested by the honorable senator, and take over debts to the amount of £1,665,000. South Australia will be charged her share of the interest on that, and when the principal comes to be paid, surely she will be entitled to pay her share of that principal? </para>

                        <para>- That depends on circumstances. If it is for the maintenance or continuance of the service as at the time of the transfer, it will be charged to the State. For instance, supposing that a small post-office is inadequate, and is pulled down, and that a post-office for that place is erected on. another site and on a larger scale, that, I take it, will be State expenditure. But supposing that a new post-office is erected in some new place, and is not to carry on the business as at the time of transfer, that will be Commonwealth expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- You cannot have a sinking fund until after the expiry of the bookkeeping period, and it will not end, I take it, until five years at all events. During that period, every penny of revenue acquired will be required to be distributed amongst the States, month by month. Surely the Minister must see that the first line of section 89 of the Constitution evidently intends that it shall be for revenue purposes ? Then, in section 90, we are told what is to take place on and from the imposition of uniform duties. I have been quite taken aback by the Minister's arguments. Will he tell us what is to be done with future loans? Is he always going to debit each State with a portion of the loan? When half-a-dozen men go into a partnership, they put in so much capital, but, if the firm borrows afterwards, they do not debit each partner with a share of the loan. The Commonwealth is a large partnership, and, should it ever come to dissolve - which it will never do - then it might divide the debt amongst the partners, but the Commonwealth, as a Commonwealth, has its debt, like any other country. I strongly support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- If paragraph (a) makes it perfectly clear, well and good ; but I am not inclined to give the option. I know that the State Treasurers have looked upon it as a matter of course that the Commonwealth would not pay cash for the indebtedness, but would take over a corresponding amount of the States' liabilities. They cannot understand this clause without a great deal of trouble. When I first read it I failed to understand it. I showed it to a gentleman who has been Treasurer of a neighbouring State for many years - a highly-intelligent financier - and he could not understand it, and not until we got the other paper, which gives the examples, did a glimmering of what was intended dawn on our minds. My idea is that we should excise the clause. It is simply like chips in porridge. ' It does neither good nor harm. So far as I can see it will benefit neither the Commonwealth nor the States. It may save a little bit of bookkeeping, and that is all it can possibly do. It will never be thoroughly understood by the States ; and the States are looking forward with a great deal of interest to the fact that the Commonwealth is going to take over a portion of their debts and liabilities, and will be much disheartened by this clause. They were looking forward to the Commonwealth taking over certain of their liabilities that rest upon their shoulders at the present time. That could be done with advantage to the Commonwealth. Because if the Commonwealth takes over £1,000,000 worth of debt from the States, paying them 31/2 per cent, interest until those bonds mature, the Commonwealth will be able to go to the English, market at a lower rate, and the whole country will be benefited thereby, instead of throwing back the liability upon the States. Let it be remembered that the States will never be able to borrow money so cheaply as the Commonwealth can, and that it will be of advantage to the Commonwealth and the States, as a whole, if the Commonwealth Government takes over those State liabilities. The amount of interest that will have to be paid by the States will thus be reduced, and the amount of interest paid by the Commonwealth, as a whole, will be reduced. This clause is a mistake, and I shall vote for its recommittal. </para>

                    (Western Australia).The position put by
                    depends upon the construction to be placed upon the word "expenditure" as used in section 89 of the Constitution. Of course, any Act of Parliament which we pass cannot affect the position of the States under the Commonwealth Act.
                    ays that the word "expenditure" in this section means the whole expenditure of the Commonwealth whether capital or otherwise. Although I agreed with
                    at the first sight, I am afraid I cannot agree with him now, because I have closely perused section 89 of the Act, and find that it starts with the words -

                        <para>- It is a very rough estimate, but it does not matter to a few hundred thousand pounds in the case of public spoliation of this character. If one is going in for bushranging it doesn't much matter whether he steals one mail bag or the whole coach. This is one of those occasions on which it is proposed to go for the whole coach, and the mail bag would only be an incident of the proceeding. I am absolutely asked to come here and represent a State and give a vote that means that that State is to hand over property to the tune of £3,250,000, and be called upon, in addition, to pay £600,000. </para>

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General says " no " with an amount of enthusiasm worthy of a better cause, but the figures plainly show that while the Commonwealth proposes to take over in round figures £10,500,000 worth of property, it only proposes to pay in respect of that a little under £1,200,000, the difference amounting to £9,250,000 is to be taken by the Commonwealth without either relieving the States of their public indebtedness to that extent or paying them ; otherwise there is no meaning in the clause. I would like to know whether the Commonwealth Government expects to come into legal possession of the property in question under such terms. It is a Government which has no power whatever in the land. It does not possess legally a defence force nor a single soldier. It has not a law court nor does it command the services of a policeman. And how does it expect to obtain possession of £10,000,000 of property in this free-booting style? </para>

                        <para>- I have referred to that matter; I said that if we paid cash it would be necessary to raise a loan of £1,671,000. The money would then be paid in the proportion shown in the third column of the table. The loan being, I take it, a loan raised for Commonwealth purposes, and therefore " for other expenditure " under sub-section (6) of section 89 of the Constitution, the interest would be debited in proportion to the population monthly to each State. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that the leader of the Senate did not see his way clear to accede at once to the proposal for the recommittal of the clause, because it involves a question of very great importance indeed. He will hardly say that we had a full opportunity to consider the clause. The Minister stated that the position of the States and the Commonwealth is not altered by the clause. Not only is it not altered, but legally it cannot be altered. On the other hand, a recommittal would give an opportunity to those who do not thoroughly understand the matter, or who wish for further consideration, to see what, under the circumstances, is the good of the clause. I supported it, and I shall continue to do so. </para>

CAMERON (Tasmania). - I should like to explain that at first I to a certain extent agreed with the speeches made at the beginning of the debate, and was inclined to vote for the recommittal of the Bill ; but after the clear explanation which has been made by both the representatives of the Government, I am satisfied to vote for the clause as it stands in the Bill. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - A matter of this kind could be more intelligibly dealt with in committee, involving, as it does, figures and calculation. But I take advantage of the opportunity of pointing out to
                    the grave fallacy underlying the position he takes up. In the first place, it is true that this particular clause refers to the transferred services and the capital value of the properties taken over. But let me tell
                    that exactly the same principle under which this clause is set out as applicable to the transferred properties would equally apply to expenditure upon any railway construction by the Commonwealth. If this capital expenditure - because there is no distinction - has got to be contributed by the States on the basis of this clause
                    then any other and every other capital expenditure of the Commonwealth will have to be contributed in exactly the same way.

I see a column upon the paper which has been circulated in connexion with this clause, showing that the value of the transferred property from Tasmania is £436,000. Her contribution is £512,000, and the difference between those sums is £76,000. Poor Tasmania has committed the enormous offence of not having sufficient property to hand over to the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- Then I do not know what a thorough explanation is. I am pointing out that these figures which are supplied to assist in the interpretation of the clause, show that Tasmania ought to contribute on a population basis £512,000, and that she will have handed over property to the value of £436,000. The difference, £76,000, is what she ought to have handed over in addition. </para>

We have already opposed the paying over of this money in cash, and what we have said, and what is embodied in paragraph (6) of clause 44 is that the payment should be made by the taking over of an equivalent amount of the debt owing by the State, to be ascertained upon an actuarial basis. </para>

                        <para>- I am not talking about how they are to be charged. This is a proposition which may be carried out without the consent of the States who are parties to the bargain. I hope the clause will be recommitted, and if it is not struck out altogether, that some amendment will be introduced to enable the States to have some say in the matter, so that their finances shall not be altogether disarranged, and that they shall not have imposed upon them an unfair charge in respect of a liability for the capital expenditure of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- There are certain objections ; but if we put the heads of departments in their right places, and associated with them one commissioner, who would practically decide with them, we should not rob them of then- responsibility and perpetrate the farce of giving responsibility to the heads of departments, while giving all the power of administration to an irresponsible outside commissioner. I think we might expect something of that sort to work far better than history shows the boards of the States have worked in the past.

                    <para>- I propose to allow the greatest latitude in this connexion, because it is quite impossible to say whether these words should be omitted or otherwise, unless arguments are permitted as to the effect of such a course. In addition to that, there was a general understanding in committee that the fullest latitude should be permitted in the discussion of this clause, so that we might ultimately come to a conclusion. I therefore decide that there is no point of order. </para>

                        <para>- That would not be a very good reason, because if the permanent head were at the beck and call of the Minister, and liable to be discharged at a moment's notice, he would be very likely to concur if the Minister wished at any time to make a political appointment, hope that those in favour of the Government carrying out certain work on behalf of the community will endeavour to have that service carried out in the most effective and economical way. I trust that honorable senators will have formed a higher opinion of their duties than to be, as has been suggested, labour agents ; and labour agents without the commission. I do not think it should be the duty of Members of Parliament to be so hampered as they are in many cases, owing to the fact that Ministers have it in their power to bestow certain officers. I am very much in favour of the Government, wherever it is possible, carrying on certain large services such as we now possess. If we do not make the public service effective and economical, we shall always be liable to be charged with want of due economy and extravagance. It is a continual reproach to the federal service, indeed to all civil services, that there is the Government stroke, and that the State does not get the value of its money. If we do. away with political patronage, which I submit we are more likely to do through the appointment of one commissioner, we shall give merit a chance. I can well believe that in the civil service of the States many good men and true do not get a chance because some political supporter is put over their heads time after time. If we appoint a commissioner, and give him the powers which he will have under the Bill- </para>

Under the Bill the commissioner is to have only a seven years term of office. I am very much in favour of the commissioner being allowed to hold office during good behaviour, subject to removal by a majority vote of Parliament at any time. From such a system I think we should be more likely to get better service. I can well believe that towards the end of a seven years term, knowing that he may desire to get the support of the Ministry or party in office, the commissioner may be inclined to do things suggested by Ministers, or by Members of Parliament, which, under other circumstances, he would not do. I hope that we shall preserve the main principle of the clause - to have only one Public ServiceCommissioner. </para>

                    has placed me in an awkward position, because very naturally I want to discuss my amendment. The object of the former amendment I circulated was to place before the Committee the advantages of a board of three members, and with a view to economy I suggested that it should consist of permanent heads. But having since had an opportunity of thinking carefully over the matter, and recognising frankly that it is desirable, as far as possible, to fall in with the views of a Ministry, whatever it may be, so long as. it is not seriously wrong, I am inclined to make the board consist of the commissioner, as proposed in the clause, and two permanent heads of departments, the commissioner to be the chairman.

My object is not to belittle the chief officers of each State, but to protect them from undue political and Ministerial influence, and to enable them to discharge their duties in administering their departments. In a State, it never has been the duty of the head of a department to appoint officers, even under the old regime. It is not the commercial practice. No large commercial house, bank, or financial company leaves to the head of a department the power of appointing and removing officers. </para>

                        <para>- The board. In a large business establishment, if there is an appointment to be made it is not left to the heads of the department to make it, but the partners meet together and discuss the matter. This Bill provides for one Public Service Commissioner. It is perfectly true that under clause 44, sub-clause (3), the Minister has power to veto any recommendation made by the commissioner. A.t first sight that might seem a very wise and desirable check, but I should like to know what Minister would care to place himself' in such a humiliating position as having to lay before Parliament his written explanation as to why he differed from an officer who probably had been appointed by himself. I cannot conceive how on earth Ministers, many of whom are experienced men, could have framed such a provision. I should think that no Minister would belittle himself by placing himself in that position. </para>

                        <para>- I only mention this to show that there is a great objection to trusting to the head of the department such as I have referred to in connexion with the Victorian railways, and there is equally an objection to trusting to the judgment of any Ministerial head of a department. Ministers are even more amenable to political influences than officers such as the Chief Commissioner would be. I would again point out that it is not usual in any commercial house or financial or banking institution to permit appointments to be made by one man. In the case of a firm, if there are partners, they always meet together and discuss appointments. In the case of banks there is a staff committee appointed to recommend all appointments. In finance institutions the practice is exactly the same. We may depend on it that that is the result of many years' experience. I suggested, in connexion with this amendment, that it was desirable not to go to the expense of appointing even one commissioner, for the reason that it would! be wise at the start of the Commonwealth to work on economical lines. But, on reconsideration, I think we might very well appoint a Public Service Commissioner as. chairman, and, in addition, appoint two of the permanent heads of the departments to act with him. In my amendment I limit that appointment to three years, because I am convinced that ultimately we. shall have to appoint three fully-paid officers.. In the meantime, with only about 11,000 officers, I think it would be wise to make the amendment I have suggested. Let us have a Public Service Commissioner, as recommended by the Ministry, and in addition two permanent heads of departments, not chief officers, to form a board of three.. Of course, there have been complaints made in connexion with the Public Service Board of Victoria, and it would be marvellous if it were not so, bearing in mind the fact that in 1 883, when they were first appointed, with the exception of the Railway department, they had to deal, with the whole of the service, and it was then in a thoroughly disorganized condition from top to bottom. They had to administer an Act which was new to them and new to the officers also, but from my intimate knowledge of what has transpired during these years, and having had frequently to look into complaints made by public officers, I am able to say that in nine cases out of ten the complaints made by officers against decisions of the board were not justified. In the vast majority of cases the complaints were made by the malcontents of the service, who are always finding fault with everybody else, and whose sole object is to make use of the Public Service for their own good, irrespective of what may be fair and just to their fellow officers. I have had many such people come to me, and I have no doubt that other honorable senators have had a similar experience. I would advise honorable senators before accepting the statements of public officers to go to the Public Service Board and test them. Their experience will be like mine. They will come to the conclusion, not that the mistakes and errors of the board are very numerous, but that it is a marvel that under the circumstances they have not been more numerous. In the last few years, since 1893 the duties of the Public Service Board were very unwisely thrown upon the .Audit Commissioners, thus doubling their work. There have in consequence been mistakes made for want of knowledge of the Act, and actions have been recently decided, and are now pending, which will probably ultimately cost the State a pretty sum of money. </para>

                        <para>- No ; the honorable and learned senator is inferring to chief officers. I suggest that there should be along with the Public Service Commissioner, proposed in clause 5, two permanent heads of departments, who will be wherever the seat of Government is - permanent heads of such departments as the Post-office or Customs department, or other federal department I feel that in that way we may have a good practical and economical board, for the cost will be the £1,500 for the chairman, as proposed under "the Bill, and some little extra expense for "the assistance of the two permanent heads. In addition, of course, there must be inspectors, who will go through the length and breadth of the States and make themselves conversant with the duties and qualifications of the various officers, so that they may be able to report to the board, who will then be in a position to decide. </para>

                        <para>- The secretaries will be the heads of the departments, and to appoint chief officers would be putting those duties upon a subordinate officer, and I am not aware of such a system being in force anywhere either in Commercial or political matters. I propose to make the selection from the permanent heads, and the honorable and learned senator would take the chief officer, who would be one step lower, and is simply the head of one of the branches of the departments in the States. </para>

                        <para>- He would not be more conversant with the working than the commissioners I suggest would necessarily be through their inspectors. In bank management managers of branches are not allowed to have anything to do with the appointment of an officer. .It is done on the .representation of the inspector to the chief manager, who brings the matter before the board of directors. I frankly admit that I would prefer that the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner should be during good behaviour rather than for a term of seven years ; but with the attention I have been able to give to this matter since 1883, I say that the appointment of one man will not work out as we want it to work, because that one man will be amenable to influences that three men would not be subject to. In this case there is safety in numbers, and the three members of the board would be able to obtain a better knowledge of the whole working of the department than any one man could possibly do. My intention, therefore, is to support the retention of the words in the clause providing for the appointment of the Public Service Commissioner proposed by the Government, and then to move an amendment which I have had circulated for the appointment of two permanent heads as members of the board. </para>

                        <para>- They could have done a great deal of damage without breaking the law. If we keep the public service under Ministerial control, what is the danger? We are told that we shall be cursed with political influence ; that everybody will come to Members of Parliament and ask them to intercede with the heads of departments to get them employment. Under a properly considered Public Service Act, nothing of that kind could occur. In the " model State " a man's name has to go down, and he takes his turn in priority of application, all other qualifications being equal, and that is where his safety comes in. The Act has not been all that it ought to be. From time to time attempts are made to amend it, and I hope they will yet be successful. That is parliamentary work, and has nothing to do with the administration of the service at all. What I want is not to appoint a commissioner but to make the Ministerial head responsible to Parliament for everything that is done in his department. Everything that is done must be done under the Act, and I am going to show honorable senators how everything can be found out that is done wrong. We do not want to find out what is done right any further than is necessary for the promotion of officers. What do we want the Civil Service Commissioner for? To see that everything goes right. If everything goes right, there is no ado about it ; but if anything goes wrong, we want to hear of it. Let us stick to Ministerial control. Let us make the Minister responsible. Give him a good working Act to administer, and no difficulty can arise that he cannot efficiently cope with. How is that to be done ? What is to be done in connexion with the public service ? The greater portion of it has already been transferred from the States under the Commonwealth Act. That Act provides for all that has already been done. What we want to do now is to provide first for new appointments, and then for the proper promotion of officers and the efficient working of the departments. That is what we have to legislate for. In the first place, take new appointments. Every new appointment is to be made in any department from candidates who have put down their names as applicants for positions. </para>

                        <para>- I put it in that way, because no officer of the service, nor any Member of Parliament who had any influence, nor any individual in a high social position, if he knew that his conduct was going to be publicly reviewed by a board of appeal, would ever attempt to do anything of this kind, unless he was a person who had no right to live in a civilized country at all. It is for that reason I say that this appeal board would destroy the necessity for an inquiry, be a protection to a Minister, and do away with the political and social influence that so many honorable senators have spoken about. It is to a Public Service Act that we have to look for the abolition of corruption, or undue influence of any kind, rather than to the appointment of a commissioner and inspectors. I hope that this Parliament will think the matter over well before they go to the expense of £4,000 or 5,000 that would be better spent in increasing the salaries of those who are very poorly paid at the present time, rather than by creating billets that are really not necessary, and would only be the laughing stock of every individual in the Commonwealth. </para>

Let us suppose that a member of this House possesses any kind of influence whatever, whether it be Ministerial or departmental, his life is little better than a pandemonium. From early morning until next morning, he is assaulted under all circumstances, and at all times, and almost in all places, to use his influence in connexion with Government appointments. The thing has reached a pitch of absolute public misfortune. </para>

                <para>It will be admitted that I have now quoted expressions of opinion upon political patronage from the leading statesmen of the various States of Australia. That system, I contend, has been discredited, and in three States in which there is the largest population and the largest number of civil servants, they have found a system of direct Ministerial control to be pernicious to the best interests of the service. If honorable senators have studied the Bill carefully and understand its true object and scope, and if they have considered the different systems of management that have been in force in the different States, they must admit that this Bill is in principle only the natural corollary </para>

The object of appointing the commissioner is to take away from the Minister the power of initiation. The Public Service Commissioner will suggest or recommend alterations and transfers, and the various changes 'he deems necessary in the service, and it rests with the Minister to confirm or disallow his recommendation as he likes. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. We must bear in mind that the commissioner has another duty to perform, because we wish to introduce into the civil service something of the energy and ability devoted to the service of private firms and corporations. If it has been found difficult to do this in the various States in the past, it will be six times more difficult to do it adequately throughout the Commonwealth. Take the case of the Customs department, which extends over the. whole of the Continent of Australia. If we take the case of the Post-office, we find that its influence extends even beyond the bounds of the Commonwealth. These departments will have offices from Hobart to Rockhampton, and from Sydney to Port Darwin. How can the head of the department, without a commissioner and inspectors, properly control huge departments like these ? </para>

                        <para>- I will explain that in a minute. People have said that inspectors have not been required in the various States, but it must not be forgotten that we are now dealing with the Commonwealth, and not with a particular State. We will find that in the case of a bank established in Melbourne, and without branches, no inspectors will be required, and similarly in connexion with the public service of Victoria, where the bulk of the civil servants have been centred in </para>

                        <para>- I say there is a very good analogy, and we want, if possible, to run these services on business lines. We want to introduce some business energy and ability into the service. If we can do that we will have a service that we may be proud of, but we cannot have a service that will work properly unless we have inspectors who are given the right to report. I would ask honorable senators to* consider for a moment what would be the position of any large banking institution having branches throughout Australia if they tried to conduct their business! without any inspectors ? The bank manager could not possibly go to the.various branches to inspect them for himself. He would have to rely absolutely on the report of his manager. Exactly the same thing would obtain, in the civil service. The head of a department could not leave Melbourne except for a holiday. He could not go to the various parts of the Commonwealth in order to see whether the reports of his officers were correct. The chief officer in Perth, for example, would be 3,000 miles away from any authority, and how could proper control be exercised unless inspectors were sent out to report to the Minister ? I cannot understand how honorable senators who have studied this matter condemn the proposition that we should have inspectors to see that the work is carried out properly. One or two honorable senators have referred to the enormous expense. I do not know how many inspectors there will be ; there may be two, perhaps, or six. </para>

If I am allowed to say what I desire to put before the committee, perhaps some honorable senators who imagine that I am doing their views a grievous despite, may not find that I am so very unreasonable in my opinions after all. I say I supported the appointment of this board in 1895. I condemned it two years later, I condemn it still, for those acts, and I am highly opposed to the creation of a board, whether of one, two, or three, that shall possess a similar amount of authority to that which has been granted to the Public Service Board in New South Wales. I am highly in favour of the retention in some shape or form of Ministerial responsibility. I do not believe in passing this Bill in a form which would enable Ministers of the Commonwealth to say to me what Ministers in New South Wales Governments have said to me - "Neild, I do not know who are in my department ; I never know when a man will be taken away or a fresh one sent in. I have no control over any one in my department." </para>

                        <para>.- I am in favour of the retention of Ministerial responsibility. If honorable senators like, I have no objection to some limited form of Ministerial patronage, because I am not sure that it is the worst form of patronage. I prefer the patronage of a Minister who may be brought to book - if he has not too large a majority at his back - for improper conduct, to a board, the members of which are influenced by other forms of patronage, and whom we cannot get at because we have placed them by law outside the power of parliamentary interference. The patronage of the club or of the drawing-room is just as objectionable as the patronage of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that this amendment will be submitted in a partial form merely to test the question. I read in the press that the Ministry propose to appoint a Council of Defence. Supposing that the Ministry do submit in a Defence Bill a provision for a Council of Defence where there would be opportunity for the discussion of questions of a complex character, a similar proposition might be desirable in connexion with a measure for the management of the public service. </para>

                        <para>- I think the honorable senator must have misinterpreted the policy of the Bill. Under the measure we are to have a. commissioner with certain inspectors - not more than six. I understood from what has been said by responsible Ministers in another place that the real object of providing that not more than six inspectors shall be appointed was in order that each of the States might receive consideration. If we have an inspector for each State his duty will be to become acquainted with the whole of the service in that State, to know all its branches, and the members of the service under his control. He will report to the commissioner. The commissioner is the connecting link between the inspectors and the Ministerial head, whilst through the Ministerial head there will be communication with Parliament. So that there we shall have interdependence and an absolute chain that will practically overcome every difficulty that exists where we have only Ministerial control. </para>

                        <para>- If we had 100 boards we could never have throughout the civil service of the Commonwealth those conditions which we must get if we want to secure efficiency. We should require to have a board for each particular department, perhaps each particular sub-department, and then there would be no relations, no independence, and consequently no uniformity between the boards themselves. I have listened very attentively to all the arguments that have been addressed to the committee by honorable senators, who have suggested various alternative schemes; and I cannot find anything in the suggestions which, so far as protection to the civil servants or cohesion and uniformity in administration is concerned, in any degree approaches the one submitted to us in the Bill, and which I therefore support. </para>

                        <para>- I do not say that. Attention has been drawn to the fact that, to commence with, we have a civil service of 11,000 officers, and with average pay the expense comes to over £1,000,000 a year. Under the Bill, the commissioner is to receive £1,500 a year, and six inspectors £800 a year each, or, altogether, £6,300 a year. That is a little more than £ per cent, upon the outlay. If we can by an outlay of 10s. per cent, secure a good service all round it is money well spent. Of course I recognise that to have an enlightened despot, if we could be certain of a succession of enlightened despots, would be a very satisfactory way of conducting the business. We know that a Czar of Russia, if a good Czar, and succeeded by another as good, is an efficient and capable ruler ; but unfortunately there is no certainty that one enlightened despot will be succeeded by another, and knowing what human nature is I believe that we ought to have a board of three. </para>

                    (Tasmania). - I thought that as the debate proceeded I should be able to decide whether in fairness I should withdraw my amendment or not. As
                    has expressed his intention of voting against it, and I cannot count upon his vote when he does not believe in the principle of my amendment it appears to me that I shall not be doing anything unfair if I take the sense of the committee on the amendment at present before the Chair, because, supposing the words are struck out,
                    can then have inserted after the word " appoint " such words as " a board of three persons, consisting of two heads of departments and a third person from outside the service."
                    said I should have gone back and looked into the history of these boards. If the honorable senator had been in the. chamber the other evening he would have found that that was just what I tried to do. What is the history of the matter? As regards New South Wales, I can put it in five minutes. Their first board was guilty of such acts of cruelty, injustice, and wrong-doing that a committee was appointed to inquire into their work, and, as I mentioned the other night, it cost £50,000, which had to be placed upon the Estimates, to undo the wrong which that first board did. With respect to the second board in New South Wales, I have heard, and I have read, that in dealing with cases it does what is provided for under this Bill, and it ignores the head of the department, who has had his officers face to face, and has seen their work from day to day. Because the new board in New South Wales ignores the rightful position and the great knowledge of the head of the department there is now a great deal of dissatisfaction with their work. If we may take the
                    as a correct guide for facts, I see that there are now 1,000 cases of appeal waiting to be dealt with. There are 1,000 cases of dissatisfaction amongst civil servants with the action of that board, and I ask honorable senators if after that experience they are now going to set up the same kind of board in the Commonwealth
                    In Victoria they commenced I think first in 1862.

                        <para>- The first Public Service Act was passed in 1862, and it worked very well until the door was opened to political patronage in making a number of temporary appointments. So great did the scandal become that after that dreadful day, " Black Wednesday," it was found that the temporary civil servants outnumbered the permanent civil servants by three to one. A very great deal of wrong and injury was done at that time and a great many temporary and permanent officers had to be got rid of. Then they appointed a board in 1883, and we find that that board commenced to jump about from one department to another. They attempted the impossible, and they laid down too strictly and rigidly different classifications, divisions, and subdivisions. Into such a state of muddle did this Victorian board get that they had to appoint what is called an Anomalies Board . to try and pick up the work the Public Service Board was intended to do. </para>

                        <para>- If it is not going to belittle itself, to lower the national life of the Commonwealth instead of raising it, it will do what Senators Sargood and Walker said they did ; it will insist, by the tone it takes up, that no Member of Parliament shall hold any intercourse with, or receive any communication either directly or indirectly from any civil servant, and try to grasp for him a position which the head of the department thinks somebody else ought to get. The whole of this evil is brought about because the members of the Senate are asked to declare that we are so open to political patronage, so weak in the back, so flabby, that we will listen to the tale of every civil servant who runs to us, and take it to the Minister, and if we are supporters or opponents use such arguments as will practically squeeze him into doing a good turn to our friend the civil servant at the expense of some other poor devil. </para>

                        <para>- No ; owing to my honorable friend's interjection, I have got a little off the track. Honorable senators have suggested that no alternative plan has been mentioned. The alternative plan which I suggest is that we do not belittle ourselves by giving control of the civil service to outsiders, but that we look to the heads of departments and chief officers as being worthy of their positions. If they are capable of managing departments which put through millions a year, surely they arc' capable of controlling, managing, and promoting the staff. We ought to have a board of two civil servants, or more if you like, in each State, and one travelling commissioner, who should be chairman of each board. </para>

                        <para>- I thought I explained that the other night. In 1893 the Retrenchment Sills were brought in, and the salaries of all the officers were reduced by a certain . percentage) - first for three years, and then for another three years, extending over six years - and when officers were appointed to fill vacancies and to discharge the increased duties at the old rate, you can hardly wonder that dissatisfaction became rampant from one end of the service to the other. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that I want to impair responsible government. I take responsible government as a matter of fact, and to be neither worse nor better than we have found it in the past. I do not suppose any Minister is particularly anxious to have thrown upon him, the responsibility of being "hobnobbed" by one or another of the Members of Parliament or his own clients to give this officer an undue rise in salary, or an undue pro motion, or to appoint such-and-such a young man. These are not pleasant things for a Minister to have to do. I believe Ministers would prefer to be relieved of them. </para>

                        <para>- Then Tasmania must be a charming place to live in politically, as well as otherwise. But we come down to the question - shall there be one public service commissioner or more? I have given my reasons for believing that it would be injurious and unwise, both in the public interests and in the interests of the service, to intrust this responsibility to one man. </para>

                        <para>- Ultimately we shall require six. I do not hesitate to say that we must have inspectors. It is utterly impossible to work this business, any more than we can work any financial concern, without inspectors. It cannot be done within the comparatively small circle of a private business, and how can we manage this huge business of the public service without bringing about chaos without having inspectors ?
