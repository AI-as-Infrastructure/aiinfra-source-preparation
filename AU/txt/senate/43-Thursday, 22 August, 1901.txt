                    <para>- The negotiations have certainly not fallen through. The matter is still the subject of correspondence between the respective Governments. In the meantime, the members of this Parliament are not suffering any inconvenience, and there is no suggestion whatever of any cessation of the present occupancy. </para>

The whole of the business on the paper is public business. One portion of it is called private business, but it is all the business of the people of Australia. Honorable senators will recognize that there are degrees of importance in public business. And the Government business, being supremely important, I think I can appeal with confidence to the public spirit of honorable senators who have private business on the paper to allow our business to be carried on, at all events until the Tariff is introduced, and there is' nc further necessity for the call I am now making on the time allotted to private business. </para>

                            <para>- It is very charming to see this great anxiety on the part of the Government to deal with the Tariff ; but, in view of the condition of public business, we are forced to the conclusion that if the Tariff is to be dealt with, some of the measures which occupy the attention of Parliament will have to go by the board for this session. There is a hugely contentious measure, apparently, before the other Chamber in the Post and Telegraph Bill. There is another hugely contentious measure before that Chamber in the Defence Bill. In the Senate we spent a couple of months on the Post and Telegraph Bill. And the Public Service Bill will take up, if not as much time in committee as the second reading debate in the other Chamber took, apparently a great amount of time. The Customs Bill is also in the way, and on the top of all "these many interesting items in the Government menu there is the Immigration Restriction Bill. </para>

                            <para>- That is doomed. Nobody thinks for a moment that the Government are idiotic enough to go on with that nonsense. There is only one possible object which could actuate the Government in going on with the Bill, and that would be the amount of patronage which they would be able to dispense under its provisions. It would be much more desirable to go on with the necessary legislation to constitute the High Court, before which will necessarily come some of the questions already discussed and recognised by both Houses as being outsidetheir jurisdiction. In regard to the other numerous and important measures, I do not wonder at theGovernment wanting private members' time, and the only wonder is that the Government do not want continuous sittings, Sundays included, with intervals for prayer. In my anxiety to see the production of this long delayed Tariff Bill, I support the motion with the necessary proviso that, unless some very unforeseen circumstances occur, I shall beafforded an opportunity of passing through its final stages the Bill which was read a second time on Friday last. </para>

                    <para>SenatorCLEMONS (Tasmania).- It is highly desirable that facilities should be given to the Government to get on as quickly as possible with public business. I desire to see that power granted to the Government, because I want to put the Government in such a position that the whole responsibility for any delay will rest on them. We cannot make the powers of the Government too fulland ample, in order that public business may be proceeded with. </para>

                    <para>- It will be quite impossible to discuss this clause without reference to clauses 123, 124, and 184. This clause is intended to meet the case of all vessels entered outwards for parts beyond the seas, and is really in favour of a certain amount of liberty being given to ships which require stores for the use of passengers and crew. The Government apparently consider that these provisions will be the means of securing a large revenue, which would not be obtained if they were not limited to vessels entered outwards for parts beyond the seas, and that it is necessary to insist that none of thestores shall be used until the vessels are clear of the last port of departure in the Commonwealth. While we appreciate the object the Government have in view, we want to see how far they have the power they are attempting to assume. The Government are responsible for the Bill in whatever shape or form it may be submitted to the Legislature, and subsequently submitted to the Governor-General for the Royal assent. We, on this side of theSenate, feel that it would be a very serious tiling indeed, if, after all the labour bestowed on the Bill in this and the other House, the Royal assent should in consequence of an illegality be refused.I hope that whatever our legislation may be, it will never be necessary for a Bill to be returned for the purpose of amendment. We believe that we can pass our own legislation without its being necessary for suggestions to be made by the representative of the Crown, although there is always the reserved power to disallow Bills. We have to consider how this clause is to be made effective. The wording shows clearly that if a vessel is entered for a Commonwealth port it will not be possible for it to get the stores duty free. But a vessel entered outwards for parts beyond the seas may get goods duty free, though the master is not allowed to interfere with those stores until the vessel leaves the last port of departure. I take it that a vessel bound from Sydney to London, but calling at intermediate ports, would not be able to get goods duty free to supply passengers between thoseports, and that the stores would have to be sealed up. It is proposed to prevent the breaking of the seals, and by that means it is thought the clause can be enforced. While we have undoubtedly jurisdiction over vessels coming into our own ports, and in our own territorial waters, it is impossible for us to keep an eye on what is done when vessels are beyond our jurisdiction. Even in the case of English ships we are only given jurisdiction, by section 5 of the Constitution, over those whose first port of clearance and port of destination are in the Commonwealth. It is perfectly clear that we have no jurisdiction beyond the threemile limit in regard to over-sea ships. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the explanation, but the fact remains that there is no provision in any State similar to the one we are at present considering. Then, again, we have to consider whether the clause would not involve great cost, and interfere materially with the trade along our coasts by punishing our own passenger and goods traffic. We have first to bear in mind that hitherto a foreign vessel could go from one port to another within the Commonwealth and be supplied with free stores. My own feeling with regard to this provision is that we should enable all vessels that are entered outwards to obtain free stores, because I jim not prepared to place our own vessels at a disadvantage as compared with vessels from any other part of the world, whether they be foreign-owned or Imperial-owned vessels. I do not see how we are going to enforce provisions of the character suggested by the Government, making penalties applicable for certain breaches of the law on the part of foreign-going vessels, although I quite recognise that we can do it with regard to our own ships locally owned. "We have power under the Constitution Act to deal with them as we may think fit. But no one wants to handicap them as compared with ships owned in other parts of the world. The only way 1 can see of getting over the difficulty is - although this may mean a serious loss of revenue - that we should say that all vessels, irrespective of their port of' destination, should be able to be supplied with free goods for use on the voyage, wherever that may be. Although we might lose on the one hand by that arrangement we would gain on the other. There could then be no question as to the fairness of the Government with regard to the respective parties. The objections to the clause as it stands are, that it is doubtful whether we can enforce it on foreign ships, even if we &gt; can on our own ships ; and next, that it brings us face to face with the question of whether we can constitutionally pass such a clause, and whether it will not be the means of causing great difficulty in getting the Hill passed. The language of section 5 of the Commonwealth Act shows that the Imperial authorities were only prepared to give us power to deal with a limited class of vessels - only the vessels in our own waters that were purely conducting trade from one port to another. I do not suppose that provision would have been inserted in the Commonwealth Act unless it had been thought necessary by the Home authorities to make this limitation. I do not propose at the present moment to move an amendment, because it is just as well that we should have the whole matter thrashed out. The amendment I have prepared is that we should omit the last five words of the clause. That would have the effect of putting all shipping on the same footing, forgetting free supplies of stores. I do not think we can constitutionally or. legally pass a provision in this Bill compelling foreign ships to observe the condition that is attempted to be enforced under this clause, and which* is considered necessary in order to put our own ships on an equality with ships coming from other parts of the world and carrying passengers from port to port. </para>

                    <para>- I quite agree with the remarks of the Vice-President of the Executive Council in considering the clause we are now dealing with as being occasioned by novel conditions. But because those conditions are novel they are not in any degree less important. I ' wish to indicate what, in my opinion, is the reason for the appearance of the clause. We all know that prior to, federation any boat travelling from a port of one State to another in the same State had to pay duties on the goods consumed on board. The reason for that was obviously a common sense one - that those goods were practically being consumed within the particular State from which they were taken, and that a ship' sailing from one port in that State to another was practically speaking in -the same position with regard to consumption, as if the goods were consumed actually within the State. No one had any objection to that. But in consequence of federation the fiscal area has been enlarged. It is now obvious to all of us that if a boat departs from one port within the Commonwealth to another port within the Commonwealth, irrespective of the States, it is, practically speaking, brought under the same rule that governed its operations in respect of the consumption of dutiable goods, between port and port in the same port before federation. It is obvious that that new aspect has made the necessity arise for the insertion in our Customs Act of a clause like that before the committee. I am glad to be able to approach this subject quite apart from any party feeling. It has nothing to do with either free-trade or protection. We all understand that the ships' stores referred to are practically spirits and tobacco. On whichever side of the Senate honorable senators sit and whatever fiscal views they hold, we all agree we should get as much duty out of those articles as we are able to get. I as a free-trader cannot help welcoming any opportunity of getting such duties as we are able to get out of those articles. Therefore, in that aspect this clause has my sympathy rather than my opposition. I have seen an estimate made, and believe it to be on good authority as to the amount of duty which it is expected we can collect if a clause like this is inserted in the Bill. That amount has been divided. The total is given at £60,000. It has been asserted, I believe on- good authority, that £45,000 out of the £60,000 will be derived by reason of the trading on our own Commonwealth coasters. The balance, £15,000, will be lost to the Commonwealth Treasury if we do not apply this provision as rigidly to oversea ships as to our own. Therefore, the amount at issue is practically £15,000. The argument has been used in connexion with the clause that Ave should be extremely careful not to place our own coasters in an unfavorable position in regard to competition with foreign-owned ships. Unquestionably, we have full authority over our own boats. It is equally obvious to me that our authority over British ships is limited. If there were no limit we should not have section 5 of the Constitution Act framed in its present terms. In its final sentence section 5 says that - </para>

                        <para>- I contend that it does apply. I have simply indicated that boats going to New Zealand - boats owned in the Commonwealth - are, for the purposes of this Bill, on exactly the same footing as oversea boats. I know that every honorable senator who supports these clauses thinks that he is doing something which will relieve our Commonwealth boats from undue competition with foreigners ; and in that term I include British boats. But the competition is not narrowed to foreigners only. It will also arise in the case of boats, owned in the Commonwealth, that go to New Zealand and come back. </para>

                        <para>- I am not quite certain of that. It is quite possible that by changing the registration the object might be effected. You ought, under no circumstances, to issue stores on. board any ship duty free. And if you will do that you will only lose an infinitesimal part of this revenue, which has been computed at £60,000 a year. If you refuse to allow any boats going anywhere to take on board stores duty free you will secure nearly the whole of that sum, and avoid any international complications. There is no honorable senator who will not recognise that if the Customs authorities have to enforce this clause on a French or German boat, difficulties will arise. I do not suggest that we should be afraid of any nation, but I do recognise, as I must, the force of international law and the great responsibility of precipitating international complications with any power. Those complications must arise. They may possibly be smoothed over in the case of British-owned ships, but I do not think any one of us who gives the matter five minutes' consideration will imagine, however sanguine-he may be, that a French or a German boat will readily accept the position that is forced upon it, so far as we can force it, by clause 184. </para>

                        <para>- The only reason is that the issue of free stores is a custom which has grown up in Great Britain for the encouragement of foreign shipping, and has been handed on to British colonies. I suppose that is the way the custom has grown up, and it is necessary ' to make a provision of the kind in regulating the collection of customs in the Commonwealth. Clauses 122 and 123 unitedly provide that although there shall be an issue of free stores as before, that issue shall apply only for use after the ship has left the Commonwealth. "We cut out the power of giving free stores while the ship is here, though there may be an issue of free stores from the bonded warehouse when once the vessel has entered outwards for parts beyond the sea. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator must not confuse what is right policy with what is our power. I am dealing with the absolute right which we have. The point is whether we have the right to enforce this clause, imposing duties upon goods in foreign ships. What I say is that we have the right to impose fines, or to impose duties, or to impose a capitation tax, or anything we like, upon any ship that comes within our own boundaries. We have the right to deal with the ship when she comes to .us ; and there is no doubt whatever that we have the power while that ship is within our territory to do what we do already - cause a foreign ship to have our seals placed upon her stores. We have been doing it for years. We have the power to seal up the whole of her stores, or, if we like, to extend a certain allowance to her, we may enable her to consume a sufficient quantity of freestores to serve her purpose while she is in port, or voyaging from port to port. </para>

                    <para>- There is one point to which I should like the Vice-President of the Executive Council to give attention, because I am not quite clear about it. Section 5 of the Commonwealth Act provides that we havepower to make laws dealing with vessels whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are within the Commonwealth. But take the case of a steamer trading from. Sydney to London, her first port of clearance is within the Commonwealth, but her port of destination is outside the Commonwealth. Can we make laws which will be binding on that steamer in respect of stores used upon the journey, and enforce those laws when she calls in at a port on her journey, say at Adelaide or Perth ? </para>

                    <para>- The object of this clause, as I understand it, is that all dutiable, goods; consumed in the Commonwealth shallbe liable to pay duty. I think that is perfectly equitable and reasonable, and we must all absolutely agree with it. As affecting the two classesof ships trading on our coast, there cannot, to my mind, be the slightest doubt that if it is necessary that our own coasters should pay duty upon goods consumed on them, it must be equally fair, not only to those coasters, but to all the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, that in every case goods consumed by any other persons in the Commonwealth shall also pay duty. I do not suppose there is a particle of difference in the Senate as to the equity of that statement, and the only question to my mind is whether we can carry it out with regard to all ships, and especially foreign ships, that proceed beyond the threemile limit. I have listened with great attention to the interestingexposition given by the leader of the House. I must say the honorable and learned senator has to some extent shaken my faith in my own opinion as a layman. It is perfectly true that a foreign-owned vessel coming into Perth and being within the Commonwealth, the Customs authorities are entitled to seal up anything and everything they like on board. If that vessel, in going from Perth to Adelaide, could keep within the three-mile limit of the shore, there is no question that the goods would have to pay duty. But these goods having been sealed up, the vessel goes outside the three-mile limit, and being outside that limit, it is not an illegal act to break those seals. </para>

                        <para>- I believe it is not an illegal act to break those seals. I am reminded of a Fugitive Offenders Apprehension Act which was passed some time ago in New Zealand, under which it was perfectly legal to arrest a man in New Zealand and confine him on board a steamer ; but I believe I am right in saying that once the steamer got outside the threemile limit from New Zealand, he was no longer in legal custody. But he would be in legal custody again as soon as the steamer got within three miles of Victoria. </para>

                        <para>- The question iswhether it is not better to drop that revenue than involve ourselves in difficulties, and probably lose the Bill. If we drop £60,000 of revenue we drop it in the interests of our own people, who obtain the benefit of the remission of the duty. Stores would be obtained at a cheaper rate, while freight would be kept down for passengers from port to port ; and, while losing on the one hand, the people would practically gain on the other. The matter is not of sufficient importance to justify us in doing what might turn out to be an injustice to ship-owning people, in order to secure revenue. </para>

                    <para>- The clause isa good one, and I think we have power to pass it.If I thought it was a little doubtful whether we had the power, I should not be so astutely sagacious as honorable senators opposite as to raise the question. But under the Constitution Act , we have a power given to us which none of the States had before. The object of section 5 of the Constitution Act, which provides that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth, is to make those laws apply to ships though they may be 1,000 miles out at sea, as long as their port of starting and port of destination were within the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- We manufacture tobacco, brandy, wine, and other alcoholic liquors, and many kinds of foods on which there may be duties, and we want them to go on board these ships for consumption beyond our control, duty free. Any one who does not want that is standing in the light of the interests of this Commonwealth. We may come in a future portion of the Bill to deal with clauses to show how that is to be carried out, but this clause is a mere statement that this ought to be done. A great deal has been said as to the powers the Constitution gives us in dealing with what is set down in this clause. There have been a great many challenges issued through the Vice-President of the Executive Council to cite instances. I like to challenge people, too. We have been told that section 5 of the Constitution gives us certain control over British ships whose first port of clearance and port of destination are within the Commonwealth. I challenge honorable senators to point out the part of the Constitution which says that we have no control over any other. We all know that Great Britain could not give us control over German, French, or other foreign ships, but we, as a Commonwealth, have the right to make our own laws, and the right to see that they are carried out, and it would have been foolish on the part of the British Parliament to put anything into the Constitution that would prevent us from doing that. </para>

                <para>At Bombay, Calcutta, and Aden there is no interference with ships' stores. A bond of 5,000 rupees is given on behalf Of the vessel that nothing shall be landed, and consumption Of stores by Officers and crew is allowed to proceed. The same custom prevails in. Prance, Germany, and Italy. The Customs officers' only interest is to see that no stores are landed ; they do not care how much or how little is consumed on board. How are we ..going 'to break this world-wide rule ? How can we -act on French, German, British, or Japanese ships as if they were merely in the coastal trade of Australia, and belonged to Australian citizens? The clause appears to 'me 12*g 2 so impossible that it must result in the reservation of the Bill for the Imperial assent, a circumstance which would certainly delay 'the Tariff for un indefinite time.

                        <para>- But that Bill, would not result in ' the reservation of the Customs Bill. The clause would cause Chaos on board -great ocean-going- steamers. Some of these' vessels occasionally sail with 500 or 600 passengers, and those 'engaged in the management would 'be 'placed in a most extraordinary dilemma if they had ' to have two- sets of stores, one' set; under seal, for the complete voyage, 'and another set for consumption -on the coast of Australia. Great inconvenience and difficulty would certainly be caused, and I am not sure whether -such -an 'arrangement could be made except at considerable expense. The -competition' from these oversea steamers has been over-estimated. 'I am prepared to see. Australian shipping secured, and put on a safe footing; but, at the same time, 'we ought to have some understandingas to what is at stake. It has been stated that if these clauses are eliminated' we shall drop some £60,000 in revenue : but Ave cannot drop what is not now being collected. Of the £15,000 estimated to be collected from the- oversea 1 trade, only about £1,000 can -be collected on the consumption of stores by passengers in the purely coastal trade, so that the amount of competition between oversea steamers and Australian steamers is very trifling, being something like only one in' forty-five. It must further be remembered that the oversea steamers do not carry any cargo coastwise. :But the very most has been made of this competition, which 'has been represented as overwhelming all other considerations. The Consideration which should lead us 'to a final conclusion is that of international law, which we are not in a position to defy. With the knowledge we have, and the opinions that 'have been given by eminent legal men, it 'would be a grave risk for us to pass' this Bill as at present drawn, and I hope 'the committee will 'eliminate these clauses and leave the Government to deal with the subject in a separate measure. </para>

                        <para>- The ship would have to pay that duty. As to section 5 of the Constitution Act, I think we have no power to legislate when ships go beyond the last port of call. I have ascertained on good authority that it would take something like 35 hours to seal up the stores on board a P. and O. or Orient vessel, whereas the vessels of these companies only stay at Fremantle for six hours. Under section 5 of the Constitution Act we have no power to interfere with foreign ships, and to pass the clauses as they now are would be legislating in favour of foreign ships as against British ships. I am not at all satisfied with the estimate of £60,000 as the loss which would be incurred by striking out these clauses. </para>

                        <para>- A gentleman, who is agent for a large line of steamers, expressed the opinion tome that £60,000 was quite an excessive estimate. Petitions and telegrams are coming forward now on this question, which is causing much more sensation outside than some senators are aware. We are making a bad start in legislating against the freedom of trade. The greater the freedom of trade we have in the world, and the fewer troubles of this sort that are unduly raised, the better. </para>

                        <para>- I know that;' but there may be a necessity for collections in Western Australia under a local. Act. For that- reason also it would be very undesirable that a general measure of this, kind relating to computation of duties generally should be passed, which would affect perhaps the quantum of revenue derived by Western Australia from the duties which it is her particular perquisite to impose. The real reason is to prevent the operation of this measure in the collection of duties which are already collected according to local Acts, and the computation under this measure being such as may interfere with or alter in different ways the amount of different duties collected. </para>

                        <para>- If "goods" are included under " property," that applies to customs taxation aswell as to any other taxation,and the provision will have no more force by being includedin this Bill. On the other hand, if it should turn out that the constitutional meaning of this section is that it does not, include customs taxation, it would not be wise for us., to make a provision of this kind, which might mean a very large amount ofwithdrawal of duty, and involve very difficult questions asto what is the meaning.of " State -goods." and: "State property." We all know that the States carry on very, larger businesses. Take the caseof railways and tramways for which goods are imported, and. also the case of public institutions, and we shall find that an enormous: amount of goods could come in under the denomination of "State goods," and would escape duty altogether </para>

                        <para>- What I am pointing out isthat if we are bound by the Constitution to allow these State goods to comein free, we cannot help it. But unless we are bound by the Constitution to do so, why should we allow these goods and. property of the States to come in free ? These goods and property of the States embrace an immense amount in value, and in addition to that there are many ways of evading the taxation altogether. For instance, we might have railway contracts under which the State Government would supply, the material, and there might be large contracts with a similar condition in the case of Government institutions. It wouldbe a very easy matter in the contract to arrange that the property should pass to theGovernmentbeforethegoodswereshipped. A contract might be made to deliver thousands of pounds- worth of goods to some public institution by some contractor, and ifit was made insuch a formthat the property passed before anycustoms duties were charged, it would pay no duty at all. I amgiving that simplyas an illustration to show that there might be all sorts of evasions, and: the leakage of a very large amount, of revenue. If we are prevented from dealing, with State goods by the Constitution it cannot be helped ; but I do not propose to ask the committee to voluntarily surrender any right we may have. It is, therefore,- better to leave the clause asit is. </para>

At the same time, I recognise that this apparently innocent clause obviously raises a very large issue indeed - so large an issue that- 1 am astonished that we have not all been ready and alert for the arrival of the clause. Its operation will have a very important bearing upon many of the financial proposals of the States in the future. If there is to be the construction of railways by the States; there may be a heavy duty upon steel rails, and it would come as a surprise to all the States, which under existing circumstances import all that kind of material duty free. </para>

                        <para>- If the Commonwealth were to take over the railways, or take over particular lines it could import any material it required free of duty. But a State in regard to its railways would have to pay heavy duty on its railway material. Since the Postmaster-General has control of telegraph and telephonic services he cun import what material he requires free of duty. But if a, State requires to import any such material it is liable to duty, assuming that the section does not sufficiently cover what we are aiming at. When the States entered the Union they understood clearly that the State Governments should be amply protected from any undue exaction by the Commonwealth Parliament. Certain States are beginning to complain that the Commonwealth Parliament is trying to take a little more power than they think it ought to do. Unless it is clearly within our power I do not think we ought to attempt to enact the 'provision in this clause. The Commonwealth is still on its trial, and we wish to show the people that they adopted a wise course of action when they surrendered all these powers, and that the central Government is determined to look at all matters which appertain to the States in a fair and reasonable way. We are here to represent the States, and, if we are not alive to their interest, can we expect any one else to be, or are we fulfilling our mission ? We ought to deal with this clause in a very careful way. I move- - </para>

                <para>It may be said that attempts would be made to evade this provision ; that goods might be introduced for charitable institutions, and that advantage would be taken of that circumstance to evade payment of duties. But I do not think we need fear that, because these are matters of very minor importance. When we consider the importance of constructing railways at the lowest possible expenditure, we ought to do nothing which would tend to increase the price of the material. The more railway construction there is in the various States the more work there is for our own people, and I would sooner see an extra 100 or 200 men earning wages in building railways, than see those wages added to the cost of the raw material by means of customs duties. The amendment is in accordance with the spirit and intention of the Constitution, if it does not actually come within the provisions of the Constitution. </para>

It would be much fairer to let the States pay the duty, and. in the settlement get three-fourths returned, so that each State may benefit- equally, than to allow a privilege which opens up. great opportunities for leakage, and which mightbe abused in such a way as to largely defraud the revenue. </para>

                    <para>- But I also recognise that we have an obligation imposed upon us by the very Constitution itself. I cannot shut out f rom my mind that it is proposed to collect duties upon State imports, and that consequently a progressive State, with a large area of territory requiring railway development, might be seriouslypenalized for the benefit of smaller States, or of those which have made greaterprogressintheconstruction of railways. Let me institute a parallel between New South Wales and Victoria. Victoria is a State which, so far as size is concerned, is small compared with New South Wales, but which has a longer railway mileage. This means evidently that the amount of railway work to be carried out in Victoria is very much less than that which has tobe carried out in New South Wales. We will assume that Victoria has developed its railway system to a convenient point, and that fora number of years it is not proposed to construct new lines. </para>

                    <para>- I dispute that statement. However, it is obvious that, for some years to come, the demand on, the New South Wales Government for the construction of railways must be very much greater than the corresponding demands on the Government of Victoria. That means that New South Wales will be bound by force of circumstances to import railway material to a greater extent than Victoria. The Vice-President of the Executive Council drew a comparison between a State which preferred to import its. material, and one which preferred to obtain its material from the home manufacturer but he did not make a comparisonbetween a State which is progressive - a State which desires or is obliged by circumstances to carry out a progressive railway policy - and a State which iscontent to go to sleep in this respect. So long as the bookkeeping periodremains, I am free to admit that there is no great injustice done to a State which is a considerable importer through force of circumstances. But after that period comes to an end, the position will present itself that the State which is a large importer will be a huge contributor to the.general revenue of the Commonwealth, which revenue will be distributed among the States. I would point out the extreme absurdity which will be presented if the clause is carried as it stands. Each State will have to develop.its own territory by means of railways. For the purpose of constructing railways, the States must, so far as we. can judge, be borrowers. We are actually seeking, if this clause is carried as it stands, to place the States in the position that they will borrow money not, only for constructing railways, but. forpaying duty to the Federal Government; so that the Federal Government will be living on money borrowed by the Statesunder their public works policy. Surely we do not want to bring about a position by which theFederal revenue will obtain the benefit ofa large portion of money borrowed by theStates. </para>

                        <para>- One strong argument might have been used from the other side, and that is that the clause might force the States to some extent to see the advantage of handing over their railways to the Commonwealth. I am in favour of that, but at the same time we are here as representatives of the States, and it is our duty to protect the States as far as possible. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>When the complete goods are free of duty theparts of such goodsshall also be free. This amendment is in harmony with the clause. The principle of sub-clause (1) is a proper principle. There are some goods which will be admitted free of duty, and I contend that if such an article is imported in parts, they also -should be admitted free. If hereafter we decide that reapingmachines shall be free of duty, they may be imported in parts for the convenience of carriage. Some of the parts would represent ironwork such as wheels and axles, and without such a provision as I propose those parts, being machinery, might be taxed under the head of machinery. The amendment is in accordance with the spirit of the clause, and I do not anticipate any opposition from the Ministry or from honorable senators. It must appeal to every honorable senator as being a fair and just provision thatwhenan article is admitted at a certain duty, all the parts of that articleshall be admitted at the same rate. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator who has just resumed hisseat appears not to have read the clause. We all agree with him that if a. complete article is not liable to duty the parts of which it is composed should never be liable to duty. The clause does not say that in such a case the parts would be liable to duty. The clause refers to only dutiable goods, and, therefore, there is' not the slightest necessity for this amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I see no reason for the Commonwealth committing an error into whichSouth Australia has fallen. The proposal only means that the work of constructing machines is enabled to be done locally. Surely it is not desired to put a duty upon the parts of machines when the complete machineconstructed elsewhere is allowed to come in free? The only objection to the clause has been raised bySenatorPlayford,who holds that it is unnecessary. I do not think the clause is surplusage. Take the case of a creamseparator. A part of such a machine may be imported,and the collector of Customs may be unable to place it as being a part of a cream separator. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the whole clause is out of place. According to the reasoning of the Vice-President of the Executive Council himself, the matter ought to be discussed when the Tariff is before honorable senators. I shall vote against the clause because it contains a provision that ought to appear in the Tariff Bill. </para>

                    <para>. - I think the real reason for objecting to this proposed amendment is that it is the policy in a great many States to allow certain kinds of machinery, which cannot probably be produced in the State, to come in free. But this machinery may include iron castings, we will say, which can be produced in the State, and which, therefore, are subject to duty. If we are going to say that, because the complete machine comes in free of duty, therefore we must accept a number of articles forming portions of a machine, it will mean leaving the door open for the importation of a number of articles which can be made in the State, and which are subject to duty. Mention has been made of reapers and binders. In some of the States these machines are allowed to come in free. A reaper and binder requires certain wheels, which can be made in the State. In many cases there is a duty imposed for the express purpose of enabling those wheels to be made in the State. But, by a provision like this, we should enable persons to import a large number of wheels for reapers and binders free of duty, without any guarantee that they would not be used for other purposes, and come into competition with the local article, which is being produced under the operation df the import duty. I cannot see any reason for proposing this amendment, because I cannot see what other operation it will have than that I have mentioned. The whole of a machine comes in free, so that if a person wishes to import any number of machines he can introduce them free. But why let him introduce portions of machines, as, for instance, wheels for reapers and binders, which may very well be made in the State ? The first sub-section of the clause allows parts to come in. It makes express provision for what is called " assembling " - for putting the parts together. Therefore, where is the necessity for this proposal ? </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that if there is a clause in the Bill which is clearly and unmistakably necessary, it is this clause. It has nothing whatever to do with free-trade or protection. It only provides that if goods are made dutiable, we shall have power to prevent frauds on the revenue by any importations of those goods in detail or in sections, so as to evade the duty which ought to be paid. If there are no duties, the clause does not apply, but if there are duties everybody, who wants to conserve the fair carrying out of whatever Tariff we pass, should take care that we do not allow that to be done indirectly which we do not allow to be done directly, and that a machine which, imported complete, has to pay duty, shall not be imported in detail, and so evade the payment of duty. This clause creates no duty, but it simply says that if there is a duty imposed by the Tariff then there must be no tricks to evade the duty. </para>

I contend that we have no right to do that in a machinery Bill. It fixes what duty shall be charged upon parts of a machine, and that should be left to Parliament in dealing with the Tariff. Parliament may decide that the duty upon a complete machine shall be 25 per cent., while the parts may be admitted on a duty of 10 per cent. ; but, if this is passed, when the Tariff comes up for consideration in the Houseof Representatives they will be face to face with this provision, and if the two Bills are passed the officers of the Customs will be face to face with this provision.

                    <para>- The goods may not come under the control of the owner, but may still be on the ship or in a bond. It has been suggested to me that the words " or the owner of the goods " should be omitted, leaving the responsibility on the master or owner of the ship, if the goods are not produced on demand. It may not be within the power of the owner to produce the goods, and it would be unreasonable to render him liable to a penalty in that case. </para>

                        <para>- The owner of the ship has gone. If the captain has not been able to deliver the goods he can account for them to the satisfac-tion of the collector, and there is an end of it. He can turn up his books and show that the goods never came on the ship, and although the merchant has the invoice and the bill of lading, still the goods are not in the State. It does not occur very frequently, but it occurs one or twice in each season, and it is unfair that the innocent merchant, who not only does not get his goods but loses the chance of selling and making a profit on them, should be called on to stump up the money. </para>

                    <para>- This clause provides that where an agreement may be in existence for the sale or delivery of certain goods, on the imposition of the Tariff the seller of the goods, if he has paid the duty, may charge it on to the price at which he lias contracted to deliver them. But, on the other hand, tho purchaser may, in the event of there being a reduction of duty, deduct from the price the difference caused by the alteration from the agreed price. The practice lias been in New South Wales, where such a state of things has occurred, that by consent of either party the agreement may lae broken, and by the amendment which I intend to propose the same may be done under the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- Either party should have power to break it if he so wishes, or if that be not done, one or other of the courses mentioned in the latter part of the clause must follow. But if my amendment is agreed to, those other provisions may as well drop out. I can understand why the clause was framed. It was to enable a, trader who has hod to pay duty to pass it on, and where no duty is imposed on an article which was formerly taxed to shield the purchaser from the payment of duty. It will be seen at once that in the case I have mentioned, where a merchant has agreed to supply a certain number of articles, and where he has a certain number of them free of duty and has to take out others and pay duty upon them, he has to apportion the duty among the customers to whom he. supplies the articles. Each one of the customers will naturally say that he insists upon having the articles upon which no duty has been paid. If the duty were reduced by the Federal Parliament the position would be reversed. Each receiver of the article would insist on getting the benefit of the reduced duty, while the merchant may have paid a higher duty on half the goods he may have to deliver. </para>
