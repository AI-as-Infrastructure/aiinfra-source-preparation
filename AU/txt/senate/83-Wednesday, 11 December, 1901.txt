                        <para>- The standing orders that were adopted on the 6th of June were to operate until other standing orders had been agreed to, and this notice of motion is really for the adoption of certain standing orders. The word " temporary " in the notice of motion is only a qualification ; it is an adoption of standing orders sufficiently safe to abrogate the standing orders which were adopted temporarily. </para>

                        <para>- The whole question really turns on the word " temporary." If the notice of motion really means the adoption of standing orders on the recommendation of a committee, then there is no doubt that it is perfectly in order. The resolution of the Senate says - </para>

                        <para>- The resolution adopted by the Senate on the 5th June was to refer to a committee of five members the question of "whether the committee could recommend any, and which standing orders now in force in any State Parliament, with or without verbal modification, for temporary adoption by the Senate, until ' the Senate' shall have adopted standing orders on a report of a committee to be appointed to prepare them.'" That resolution bound the committee of five members not to recommend other than temporary standing orders, and limited the time during which such temporary standing orders were to be in force until another committee - the Standing Orders Committee - had reported. But it did not bind the Senate not to adopt temporary standing orders prepared by the Standing Orders Committee. So far as that resolution is concerned, the Senate can adopt, either permanently or temporarily, the standing orders prepared by the Standing Orders Committee. Then we come to the report of that committee which was adopted by the Senate on the 6th June. In the operative part they recommended the temporary adoption of certain standing orders by the Senate. They did not do anything more, in fact they had no power to do anything more, and the resolution which empowered them to act, did not prohibit the Senate from temporarily adopting any standing orders which were agreed to by the committee appointed to prepare standing orders, namely, the Standing Orders Committee. Therefore I think the motion is in order. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I may point out before the motion is brought on by the Postmaster-General, that as President and Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee, I think it would be a great pity if the Senate did not adopt these standing orders. Of course no standing orders that could possibly be framed would be without objection on the part of some one for some reason or other ; but these standing orders provide a means by which the provisions of the Constitution in reference to suggestions ma}' be carried into effect, whilst the standing orders under which we are now working do not. </para>

                    <para>That this Bill be now read a second time. </para>
                    <para>The Post and Telegraph Bill when introduced into this Chamber, contained a provision for the alteration of postal and telegraphic rates by the Governor-General. The scale was simply to be laid upon the table of both Houses of Parliament. Some objection was made to that provision in this Chamber, and I consented to an alteration to the effect that the regulations altering rates were to be laid upon the table for a certain time before becoming law. In that form the Bill was sent to the House of Representatives. In that House there was a strong feeling in favour of providing that there should be no alteration of rates except by Act of Parliament. An amendment to that effect was carried, and was subsequently adopted by the Senate. In consequence of that, no alteration in rates, postal or telegraphic, can be made except by Act of Parliament. It therefore became necessary for me to introduce this Bill in order to alter certain rates in regard to newspapers and telegrams. I may mention first of all that it is not proposed in this Bill to make any alteration in the letter rate. I explained, in moving the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Bill, that no matter how desirable it might be to introduce at an early stage a uniform system of postage in the States, it would be very difficult and inconvenient to do so during what is known as the bookkeeping period. I also expressed an opinion, in which I think most members of the Senate concurred, that it would be advisable to find out first of all exactly what was the financial position of the Post and Telegraph department both in the different States and in the whole Commonwealth, before committing ourselves to alterations which would involve a considerable loss of revenue. The alterations I am now proposing will not, so far as I am able to ascertain, alter the financial position of the department. That is to say, I am proposing certain alterations, which I think, in the aggregate will give an increase of revenue, and I am proposing at the same time other alterations of rates which will probably mean in the aggregate about a corresponding diminution of revenue. I say " in the aggregate," because it has to be borne in mind that any alteration we may make in the rates may mean an increase of revenue in one State, and a diminution in another ; because we are dealing with six different scales of rates, and are making an effort to somewhat harmonize them, and bring them into uniformity. I have had a table prepared showing the rates of postage levied upon newspapers in the respective States of the Commonwealth, and also the rates for telegrams. I have endeavoured to obtain from the various States an estimate of the increase or the decrease in revenue which each of these alterations will involve. I have found it somewhat difficult to secure accurate figures, because they must necessarily be based upon what may be called guess work. For instance, where an alteration is made in a telegraphic rate, we can only estimate' roughly what will be the effect upon senders of telegraphic messages - whether they will increase or curtail the length of their telegrams. Therefore, I should like it to be understood that the figures which I quote in this respect are only approximate. From the figures I have been able to obtain, I estimate that the charge for the carriage of newspapers, as shown in the schedule, will result in an increase of about £35,000 to the revenue of the department for the whole Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In all these matters it must be apparent, on consideration that when an increased rate is charged in any State, the revenue goes to that particular State, so that there is a compensating advantage. On the other hand, where there is a reduction in the charge, which is a benefit to those who use the Post-office, there is a corresponding disadvantage, inasmuch as the revenue of the department in that State is diminished correspondingly. Therefore, in regard to the carriage of newspapers, the increased revenue will go almost wholly to the three States which have had free postage hitherto. In the States where a charge has been made for the carriage of newspapers, there will be a slight decrease of revenue as a result of the rates we propose. I presume honorable senators do not desire me to go into details, but I will give one or two instances in order to show how the proposed rates work. </para>

We can allow those rates to continue if the Senate does not think it desirable to introduce something like uniformity throughout the States. To my mind it is desirable that we should utilize the bookkeeping period to secure this uniformity, and there must be something like give and take. We cannot adopt the lowest rate which obtains in any State and make that uniform. We must try as far as possible to hit upon a mean which will cause the least possible inconvenience. </para>

                            <para>- I have the figures here, but, as I have said before, they have been ascertained from the various States, and I cannot guarantee their accuracy, not on account of any want of care on the part of the officials of the department, but because it is almost impossible to exactly estimate the effect of an alteration in rates on the disposition of people to send telegrams. As to the method of charging, we propose to adopt the plan of calculation adopted in every other country except Australia - that is to say, including the name, address, and signature in the message. That will mean this alteration, that where, as in several of the States, a smaller number of words, not including the name, address, and signature, has been taken for the minimum, in future the name, address, and signature will be included in the minimum number of words. The Bill proposes that within certain limits of town and suburbs, where, for instance, we have penny postage present at the time, or within certain limits to be prescribed by the Governor-General in Council, we shall have a message of twelve words at a minimum rate of 6d., or 1/2 d. per word, and the charge upon each additional word will also be id. ; with this proviso, for which it may be necessary to make some amendment in the Bill, that fractions will be charged as pence. By this means we shall be able to a, void an anomaly in some of the States, which is that the rate per word over the number of words in a minimum message has been greater than the rate per word in the first part of the message. This has had this peculiar result, that it has sometimes absolutely paid people to split a message. By sending what they desired to say in two messages, and making the department send the name, address, and signature free twice, they have been enabled to save money, because they have been able to send those two messages at a lower rate than they could have been sent at as one message. That is manifestly absurd, and the practice adopted in Australia of not charging for the name, address, and signature has led to a great deal of extravagance in that respect. People sending telegrams very often give the full title of persons whom they are addressing, because, seeing that it costs nothing, it would seem to be discourteous if they did not send the full title. It is certain that complimentary phrases are not put in if they have to be paid for, and under this proposal, including the name, address, and signature as part of the message as in other countries, the name and address will be cut down to the smallest proportions. </para>

                            <para>- They will all be dropped out in the same way as complimentary phrases. On page 2 of this report the charges for telegrams will be seen. In New South Wales the charge has been 6d. for the first ten words, and for each additional word Id. This will give some idea of the difficulty of estimating exactly what will be the financial result of an alteration of this kind. Because, whereas our proposal of twelve words for 6d., including name, address, and signature, would seem to be rather higher than the rate in New South Wales at the present time, still in New South Wales at present, if the message runs over the minimum number of words, the sender has to pay Id. for each additional word. We propose, in connexion with town and suburban telegrams, that the charge shall be only Jd. for each additional word. In Victoria the rate has been 9d. for the first nine words, and each additional word Id. We are proposing twelve words, including name, address, and signature, for 6d., and each additional word 1/2 d. Honorable senators can compare the rates proposed with the rates at present in existence in each of the States. But this is the result as furnished to me by my officer : - In New South Wales the alteration would mean an increase of revenue of about £1,000 on the town and suburban 6d. message ; in Victoria, an increase of .£190, which is a small amount, and practically nil ; in Queensland, nil ; in South Australia, an increase of £96, practically nil ; and in Western Australia and Tasmania, nil. So that, so far as revenue is concerned, the message of twelve words for 6d. will principally affect New South Wales, and in the direction of giving that State an increased revenue of £1,000. With regard to telegrams within each State, we propose to make a uniform charge of $d. per word, or 9d. for a minimum of twelve words. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, cypher messages are always charged more ; double rates probably. The result of this proposal is estimated to be a decrease of - revenue in New South Wales of £8,500, an increase of revenue in Victoria of £14,587, and decreases in Queensland of £6,000, in South Australia of £1, 1 77, in Western Australia of £7,057, and of Tasmania in £2,300. I made inquiries with regard to telegrams from State to State, because it was suggested to me that following the principle adopted at the present time we should have a rate from one State to another, so that if a telegram was sent from one State to another across an intervening State it would pay two rates, and if it passed through three States it would probably pay three rates. After the expressions of opinion in the Senate, in reference to the transmission of Commonwealth news in connexion with the press of the various States, what I desired to do was, if possible, to equalize the rates, and to make the rates the same from any one State to any other State. The figures furnished to me showed that that would involve a loss of about £10,000 - perhaps I ought to call it a diminution of revenue - but seeing the great advantages that must result from bringing the States in touch with one another, I am prepared to recommend the adoption of a uniform rate from any one State to any other State. </para>

That makes a very low rate for the longer message. It is not to be understood that the Bill contains all the alterations I should have liked to have introduced. It is somewhat limited as necessity requires, but I should like the Senate to remember that within limits which are really prescribed by circumstances it is to be taken as a connected whole. I hope the Senate will discuss the Bill upon that basis, and I think that if it is adopted it will be of great benefit to the people of Australia. As I said before, it is so arranged that, so far as I am able to calculate, it will not mean any alteration of the present postal revenue. </para>

                        <para>The Postal Rates Bill provides for the carriage of newspapers, posted by registered newspaper proprietors, or by newsvendors, at1d. per lb., and also for the carriage of single newspapers at ½d. for 8 ozs. The1d. per lb. rate would no doubt meet the case for the distribution of small numbers sent to remote distances ; but such a rate would be prohibitive in the case of bulk parcels containing large numbers to be carried short distances. There is a wide distinction between the carriage and delivery of 1,000 newspapers addressed to separate and distinct persons, and 1,000 newspapers in one parcel requiring only to be carried to and dropped at a particular post town where the agent calls for it and takes it away. The two services are of an entirely different nature, and should be provided for under separate scales. If this be not done every newspaper publisher will be compelled to start a miniature post-office on his own account, and will require to arrange with the Railways Commissioners for the carriage of parcels to the railway station nearest to the post town, and then to make a further arrangement with the coach proprietor to carry on his parcels to the points of distribution. This will have to be done by every newspaper throughout the Commonwealth, with respect to every mail route over which his newspapers travel. This would be a costly multiplication, which could only be regarded as demonstrating the impotence of the Postal department. </para>

                        <para>The Postal Bates Bill provides for certain alterations in the rates charged for press messages, the principal alteration being an increase of 50 per cent, in the charges for transmission within the State of messages exceeding 100 words. The present price, after the first 100 words, is 6d. for every additional 50, and it is proposed to increase it to 9d. for every additional 50 ! The effect of this alteration would be that little messages of minor importance would go through without any increased charge, and long messages of great interest to every member of the Commonwealth would be subject to an. exorbitant rate. In the interests of the public the speeches of State Ministers of the Crown, and those of other leading politicians, should be transmitted at the rate which for years past has been regarded as fair and reasonable, and there should not be any handicap placed upon those newspapers which are prepared to pay for their transmission as well as for the transmission of full reports of any matter of more than ordinary public importance. This is, however, the special kind of telegraphic despatch which the proposed new regulation would penalize. Long messages costing large sums of money for transmission are not more expensive for delivery than short messages carrying a charge of only a few pence ! It is worthy of particular notice that the messages upon which this large increase is sought to Be made are exactly those upon which the department already makes the largest profit. An expert operator is capable of sending at the rate of 30 words per minute. He would, therefore, earn for the department nearly £1 an hour without making any increase whatever in the charge. His salary would probably be about £3 a week. What justification can there be for this extraordinary proposal? The effect of the proposed increase would necessarily curtail telegraphic messages, whereas the purpose of the department should be to extend business. A policy of expansion rather than one of contraction should be favoured by Parliament in this important matter. Each of the principal newspapers in the Commonwealth is now spending between £6,000 and £7,000 per annum for telegrams, exclusive of the cost for cable messages. The imposition of the proposed additional charges would not be likely to increase revenue. The effect would be to deprive the public of information it has hitherto enjoyed. It is submitted that the rate for every additional 50 words after 100 words should be kept at 6d. , and that Inter-State telegrams should be made 2s. per 100 words instead of 3s., as 2s. now represents the two local rates. It is a well-known fact in connexion with telegraphic services that low rates lead to increased business and larger profits than could be obtained from a higher scale of charges. </para>

                        <para>On the assembling of the first Commonwealth Parliament in Melbourne it became important that the people of the other States should be placed as nearly as possible on an equality with the people of Victoria with respect to all federal political news. The fairness of this course was obvious, and the Postmaster-General ordered that all ' ' Federal matter " should be transmitted at a special rate lower than that charged for ordinary press telegrams. It therefore became necessary to define what should constitute "Federal matter." It was suggested on behalf of the metropolitan press that "Federal matter" should include - </para>

                            <para>- But if the newspapers go through the post they will be charged £9 or £10 per ton, as against 13s. per ton when carried by the railways. That will be a very great handicap upon the press, and more especially in those States where there is not that close railway communication which exists in Victoria. In Victoria newspapers can be conveyed practically within measurable distance of any town, where there would be any demand for them, by means of the railways. But in other States, where the area is larger, or the mileage of railways is less, this charge will be a very much greater tax upon newspaper proprietors. Even if arrangements were made with the railways in other </para>

                            <para>- He must do so necessarily if we pass- the rates proposed in the Bill. The price of newspapers will not be increased, but if the proprietors have to pay 1/2 d. per copy for postage they will expect the subscribers to reimburse them to that extent. . We should make the charge as low as possible, so that there may be no ground for complaint, on the part of resi-dents in the country, that it is impossible for them to learn what is going on. The people throughout the country are glad to obtain the metropolitan papers, because they supply a mass of information which it is impossible for the smaller provincial newspapers to give. While I do not advocate the free carriage of newspapers, I think we should make the postal rates as low as possible. If it is possible to carry newspapers over- the Victorian railways at 13s. per ton, is it not unreasonable for the Postmaster-General to say that the charge for their carriage through the post' shall be something like £-9 per ton ? </para>

                        <para>- I agree with those honorable senators who say that more time should have been given for the consideration of this Bill. The Postmaster-General might very well have postponed the committee stage for' a little time, so that we might have gone on with other work which is upon the business-paper or which has been promised. The most practical work the Senate could do prior to the adjournment over the Christmas holidays would be the consideration of the standing orders. We might also have gone on with the Federal Elections Bill, which was promised some weeks ago. The Bill before us contains a most important provision in relation to newspapers. It is a proposal as to the justice of which I have not made up my mind. The claim generally made is I believe that it is a good thing for the community to circulate newspapers as freely as possible. If that privilege could be extended to country journals, it would meet with more favour from me, because I can see that the proposals now made in regard to" the postage and delivery of newspapers are likely to. turn out to be great concessions to the larger newspapers. We can well understand that the proprietors of the. larger journals do not see much objection to the proposal of the Postmaster-General, that parcels containing a number of papers under 4 ozs. in weight, shall be carried for a penny. </para>

                            <para>- If the proprietor of a large newspaper likes to- put up his papers in parcels, and the papers have to be 'delivered separately, it may make a consider. able difference to the postman. Some papers may run to the number- of 6 or S to the lb., whilst others will be- heavier. I should like the Postmaster-General to direct his attention to the fact that we charge for letters something like 5s. 4d. per lb. That is to say, we charge 2d. per half-ounce,, that is 32 letters to the lb. Is there not a great discrepancy between that rate and the rate, charged for the carriage of. newspapers ? It will be said that the letters have to be delivered to 32 places. Say that the newspapers average four deliveries to the lb. That means that we have eight times the number of deliveries of letters as of newspapers. If that be so, should not the charge be somewhat about eight times as great, which would of course be 8d. per lb.? We, however, charge the people who write letters 5s: 4d. per lb. There should be some equalisation to bring about a juster rate.. If there, is to be any loss on the working of the Postal department let it not be all in one direction. While I am anxious that the reading public shall get their newspapers as cheaply as possible, I do not think that the Postal department should have So bear the loss,, especially as the majority of people who receive the daily newspapers throughout the Commonwealth - that is to say, the people in the inland towns - are well able to pay, and should, I think, rather patronize their own local journals than the metropolitan newspapers.</para>

                            <para>- I am not so sure about that. Sometimes there is a party in Parliament in favour of free newspaper postage, and a party opposed to it. That was the case in Queensland where we made a change in 1891. Some opposition to the imposition of a charge was offered by certain newspaper proprietors, but the proposal was carried and no injurious result has happened. </para>

                            <para>- I believe we can find some room for economizing in the department even in South Australia, and we are continually endeavouring to do so. I think it will be seen, when we take into consideration the increased amount of business which will result, that additional taxation will not be required. I would point out that we are more likely to obtain increased business by a reduction in telegraphic charges than by lowering any other rates. In addition to the prospect of being able to recover our position through the increased business, we have to remember that there is nothing more calculated to bring the States together and to facilitate business between them than the cheapening of telegraphic rates. Although, according to these returns, it appears that the first result will be a loss of revenue, I think that in the long run the reduction in the telegraphic rates will be found to be in many cases a blessing to the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

We do not know how long it will take to pass through that House. Then it will have to receive the Royal assent, and .a proclamation will also be necessary. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to build upon that, but I wish to say that, notwithstanding that there will be a loss, the telegraphic rates, which do not affect the great bulk of the people, are to be reduced. It is true that they affect a great number, but the great bulk of the people of the States never send a telegram. The same remarks apply to the postage on letters. It is admitted that a great loss is involved in the reduction in the letter rate from 2d. to Id., though I think we were told that it would balance itself after a little while. I wish to point out that, although the Postmaster-General knew there was to be a great loss, the Id. postage was carried. This Id. postage benefits the business people of the States, but not the great mass of the people. Many business houses in Melbourne will save £200 a year by the change from the 2d. to the Id. postage rate. I wonder how much a man getting 7s. a day will save in the course of a year as the result of that change. Not Id. a month. </para>

                        <para>- It always strikes me as a peculiar thing that persons will insist that free postage is a concession to the proprietor of a newspaper, and not to its readers. At one time, when a postal rate was imposed on newspapers in New South Wales, I had to pay it, and I am informed that in- Victoria any man whose newspaper is sent by post has to pay the postage. It affects the proprietor of a big newspaper in this way, that it may reduce his circulation, because, while a man may be willing to give 6d. a week for Ins newspaper,, he may not be prepared to pay 9d. If a £d. rate is imposed, the man who lives in the big city or in the metropolis will get his newspaper at Id., but the man in the back-blocks will have to pay 1 1/2 d. The Bill is imposing a rate very much in excess of the cost for the carriage of mail matter. It is a mistake to suppose that if we impose a postage rate we make the proprietor pay,' or that by having no rate we necessarily put a large sum into his pocket. </para>

                    <para>The number of newspapers conveyed in New South Wales for the year 1899 was between 46,000,000 and 47,000,000. Last year, however, the total amounted to 51,500,000 - nearly 1,000,000 a week. I am of opinion that postage should be charged on newspapers. I believe in payment being made for services rendered. Whilst I am going to use my best efforts to secure what is fair for the newspapers, I am also going to do my part to get what is fair from the newspapers. I think that a halfpenny postage will not do any material harm to the press which we all respect and desire to encourage, whilst it will have some influence in checking the press that we do not desire to encourage, and will put a stop at once to the sort of competition which the legitimate press has to face from thousands of papers that are conducted under the guise of newspapers, but really are nothing more nor less than trade circulars. </para>

I am not quite sure whether it is necessary to add the words, but it is just as well to make the matter clear. I do not propose to make any alteration in the rates that are fixed by regulation, but from time to time it will be necessary to make the rates uniform, and I merely want to make it clear that this is a matter to be dealt with by regulation.

                            <para>- This is a matter in which we have to look, not to any one State but to all the States, and to see where the balance of advantage lies. In any case, we are dealing with three States where there has been no postage on newspapers, and they should be considered in connexion with this subject just as we have to consider the States where postage has been charged. We want to find a means,' if we can, that will bring in all the. revenue possible to States which have been in the habit of charging for newspapers, whilst at the same time we do not impose a heavy impost upon papers in States where these charges have not hitherto been made. If we were to act upon the principle of always considering the State which required the most revenue, it would mean that the most impecunious State would require taxation to be imposed for its benefit irrespective of the interests of those States which did not stand in the same position as itself. That would not be fair. The amount of money that would be lost to South Australia might be made up in some other way. It might be that the increased revenue derived by the Post-office, through reducing the rates in that State, would almost make up the loss. We know perfectly well that when lower charges are made the result is an increase of business. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it is I the duty of the department to carry bales ' of newspapers addressed to news agents,, any more than it is its business to carry large parcels of groceries. If the railways, do not offer sufficient facilities the newspaper proprietors can make their arrangements with other carriers. Our proposal is somethking different altogether. Regarding the Postal department as a great distribute ing agency, we offer to distribute newspapers at what may be a high price compared with the charge for their carriage in bulk by an ordinary carrier. Hitherto we have charged Id. per lb. for parcels of newspapers addressed to one person. Our proposal now is to carry them for Id. per lb. and distribute them separately. We are acting, therefore, as distributing agents. </para>

                            <para>- We do not desire to do that. Even if we were to charge Id. per lb. foi the carriage of small bundles to the one address, I do not think the charge would be excessive. Certainly it is a very low rate to fix for newspapers posted in bulk,, but to be delivered to different addresses. We cannot possibly reduce it. I have had the newspapers of Victoria weighed in the Library, and I find that the average weight is 2 ozs. Most of the country newspapers, run eight to the lb., so that the charge on them would be -J- of Id. each. </para>

At all events it is under 8 ozs. and they would thus be carried in bulk for less than -|d each. There are only three Victorian newspapers which weigh over 8 ozs. </para>

                            <para>- We are reducing the 10 ozs. limit in order to bring about uniformity. We are making a great concession by agreeing to carry newspapers in bulk, although addressed separately, at Id. per lb., and if this proposal is carried, we cannot in reason allow any particular newspaper weighing 10 ozs. to be carried for £d. in bulk. We should be charging a higher price wholesale than retail. </para>

We do not want this money from New South Wales, and it can be spent for the benefit of that great State. It does seem to me that we shall be acting prudently in placing New South Wales on the same footing as the other States in regard to the transmission of these newspapers in bulk, and we shall be taking a step which will be of great benefit to the smaller newspapers and these mercantile circulars, as compared with the larger papers which have been referred to. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think it will make so much difference, as the number of papers sent to us for distribution under this proposal will be practically the number that has been sent to us before in bulk. In" the case, for instance, of a small country town, newspaper proprietors, in order to save postage, have been in the habit of sending a bundle of newspapers weighing 14 lbs. addressed to an agent, who afterwards distributes the papers. The same number of papers will be sent under this proposal to the local Post-office, and in the case of a country town where there is no delivery the papers will remain in the office, and the only difference will be that when a man comes to get his letters he will get his newspapers as well. </para>

                            <para>- As to the method in which the postage will be dealt with, I may inform honorable senators of the practice in Queensland with respect to these parcels, which, I think, has proved to be a very good one. A number of newspapers separately addressed are brought in and weighed, and then a docket is prepared showing the weight, and the stamps are affixed to the docket in accordance with the weight. Suppose the number of papers brought in, in the aggregate, weighed 50 lbs., at Id. a lb. the postage would be 4s. 2d. A docket* is prepared of the weight of the bundle, and stamps to the value of 4s. 2d. are attached to the docket and then obliterated. </para>

                            <para>- If I send a ton of tea to Echuca, I have to pay £5 for the carriage of it. Certainly the freight is less in the case of wheat, because the wheat-grower could not stand so high a charge. But no one will say that the newspaper proprietors could not stand it. They are making very good profits. Therefore, a fair rate should be fixed. I thi ok that the rate proposed in the first schedule is reasonable. </para>

                            <para>- I have no objection to allowing newspapers to be sent back to the publishing offices at the rate of Id. per lb., though I do not think that the privilege will often be used. It is not customary to send back unsold newspapers. But I strongly oppose the proposal that papers shall be sent back to newspaper proprietors at anything less than Id. per lb., because that is a disastrously non-paying rate, and to ask the Postal department to carry waste paper at id. per lb. seems to me to be preposterous. </para>

						<para>- So far as I am aware, the proprietors of newspapers know within a very few copies how many each agent requires in each district, and no more are sent except there is a rush on, -when extra copies may be supplied on "spec." But unsold copies are not returned, and have not been for years past. Even if they were to be returned, we could not reasonably ask the department to carry them for £d. per lb.</para>

							<para>- I would direct the attention of the committee to the fact that the rate of Id. per lb. is higher than is being charged on our railways for the conveyance of some kinds of produce. The railways differentiate between the value of goods. High priced goods are carried at a rate for which the railways would not carry low-priced articles like wheat and coal. There should not be the same price charged for the carriage of a low-priced article like a newspaper, as is charged for articles of greater value. -While it is perfectly true that all the newspapers sent through the post cannot be carried by train, yet it has to be remembered that it is only the very small parcels that have to be conveyed by coach or on horseback. The parcels which are sent to' the larger centres of population will be despatched by train.</para>

                            <para>- It would not be a concession to them any more than to the people who read the newspapers. If the Post-office charges Id. per lb. for newspapers carried in bulk, they will not carry any, so far as the great centres are concerned, because it will not pay the newspaper proprietors to send their newspapers in that way. They will only send the smaller parcels by post. By reducing the rate, we shall be giving the people in the back blocks an opportunity of obtaining these newspapers at a lower cost than would otherwise be the case. I do not ask the committee to consider the newspaper proprietors, but the people who live up country, and I hope that honorable senators will be inclined to extend to them some consideration. </para>

							<para>- I cannot agree with all that has been said as to this charge of 1/2 d. for each newspaper falling solely on the proprietors of the big journals. In very many instances the charge of 1/2 d. per newspaper will fall on the subscribers. There is not a daily newspaper in Tasmania that can afford this extra ' postage. The proprietors will simply add to the ordinary subscription an extra charge of 3d. per week on newspapers sent out in single wrappers.</para>

						<para>- Most, if not all, of these newspapers are distributed very largely in and around the cities in which they are published. In the case of newspapers which are published here, for example, and posted to Ballarat, Bendigo, or other distant cities, the proprietors can make their own arrangements with the Railways Commissioners, and need not employ the Postal department.

                            <para>- The Government say ls. I admit that there may be some amount of loss if only the same number of telegrams are carried as have hitherto been carried, but we may expect that the cheapening of telegraph communication will increase the amount of trade ; so that, while the Government will be giving something to the people, the Commonwealth generally may be expected to gain. The uniformity of rate will not only be an advantage to men engaged in business, but will tend to induce the cheapening of living in the community generally. I hope that the committee will not turn its back on a great reform which, in the first instance initiated in the Postal department, may well be adopted with regard to the despatch of telegrams also. I hope we shall no longer have the position that it costs ls. to send a telegram between New South Wales and Victoria, and 4s. between Western Australia and New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I know that the cable will increase the cost, but, as matters stand, any loss that may be sustained by Tasmania in consequence of having to pay for the cost of cheapening this communication will be made up by that State. I hope that the amount of business will so increase that there will be no loss to the Commonwealth at the end of five years. While there will be these rates of 1/2 d. Jd., and Id. per word for "town and suburban " messages, messages to " other places within each State," and " InterState " messages, it is well to remember that at the present time the rate is 6d. for ten words within town and suburbs, and that the address and signature are not charged for. The twelve words for 6d. will include the name and address, and the signature. So that, practically, we are increasing the rates. In cases of messages between adjoining States, it is well for the committee to realize the fact that where the person sending the message utilizes his full power, he will pay a higher rate in some instances than he will now. </para>

                            <para>- In countries where this system which we propose has been adopted, persons sending telegrams get into the habit of shortening the address. That has been the case in London. One of the strong arguments in favour of this system is that it does away with the waste of the time of operators, and of the use of the wires, which is caused through people using an entirely unnecessary number of words in the addresses and signatures. They, would not use so many if they had to pay for them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that will result. There may be some .difficulty at first, but when the messengers come to know the addresses they will be able to deliver messages just as well as though a great number of words . were used in describing them. It is in consequence of this change in the method that the difficulty in estimating the financial result of the alterations in the Bill has arisen. The question of whether the thousands who send telegrams at the minimum charge will be able to convey their messages in the smaller number of words allowed them under this proposal is very much a matter of conjecture. My officers report that to a very great extent the messages transmitted at present within the minimum of nine or ten words will, in nearly all cases, be sent for 6d., that is to say, it will be possible to still further condense them. In obtaining these reports I have requested the officers of the department to take everything of that kind into consideration, and the figures they give me are based upon conjecture as to the probable result of the alteration. There are so many factors to be considered that it is almost impossible to foretell with anything like accuracy what- the result will be. Under this proposal, however, we obtain something like uniformity. In each State we shall have sixpenny telegrams for town and suburbs. </para>

                            <para>- If we adopted the shilling rate between Victoria and Tasmania, some one would have to pay the shilling to the company. It seems to me that if the department paid that shilling, it would have to debit it to the Postal department in Tasmania, and the Treasurer of that State would have to meet the increased charge. I do not suppose there would be any objection to Tasmania paying that amount if the Government of that State chose to do so, but I am not in a. position to say that the Government of Tasmania are prepared to do so. I am sorry that this difficulty exists. I am continually considering what would be the views of the* State Governments in these matters, and that is only fair during the bookkeeping period, because we do not want to play fast and. loose with what is not our own. I think it is better that this matter should be left as it is, and that the department should endeavour to obtain a reduction of the charges as soon as possible. I do not think I should be justified at the present time in accepting the amendment. </para>

                            <para>- I quite agree with the honorable senator. In dealing with telegraphic rates I desire to call the attention of the Postmaster-General to many anomalies existing. In Western Australia, for instance, a rate and a-half is charged upon messages sent after seven p.m., while in some of the other States . telegrams :are sent at the ordinary rate up to a very late hour. There is another extraordinary anomaly in connexion with press rates. The Federal Government has been legislating now for eight months, and yet it is cheaper to send a late press telegram from Sydney "to Bendigo, Ballarat, or Geelong, than it is to send one after twelve o'clock from Melbourne to those places. Surely after eight months of legislating it is an extraordinary thing that if a press message is sent from Melbourne to Ballarat after twelve o'clock, a considerably higher rate has to be paid than for a message of similar length sent from Sydney to Ballarat. No doubt the Postmaster-General has been organizing his department, but it is time now that these anomalies were removed, and that we should have uniformity in practice and hours of working, as well as in -rates. </para>

                        <para>- I am pleased to note that the Postmaster-General, by his latest utterances, recognises that the £10,000 which would be involved as a sacrifice in the establishment of uniform rates is well worth incurring for the purpose of federal uniformity. At the same time, I regret to note that, in connexion with one particular State, the honorable and learned senator is not quite prepared to apply his federal principles as logically as I think he might. </para>

                        <para>- The question of press telegram rates, which is dealt with by part 2 of this schedule, merits some consideration. In some instances the rates now proposed are higher than those charged at the present time. Every additional 50 words of a press message within any State is charged for under this schedule at the rate of 9d., whereas the present charge is 6d. I submit that that would be a fair rate to charge in the future. So far as time and labour are concerned there would be a gain to the Government in charging 6d. for every additional 50 words, because I understand that an expert telegraph operator can put through 50 words within a couple of minutes. I think the rate for a good operator is 30 words per minute. We want to encourage the use of telegrams by the newspapers as much as possible, and to increase the cost is to take a backward step. Hitherto the attitude of the Postmaster-General in regard to these telegraph rates has been to make reductions, and it would be a pity if he were to turn his back on that policy in regard to press messages. I therefore suggest that the line "every additional 50 words, or portion of 50 words, 9d.," should be altered so as to make the charge 6d. </para>

In only one State is the rate for every additional 50 words 9d. I am very anxious to adopt the principle of taking the lowest rate which we can possibly charge, and in the matter of press telegrams it is right to be as liberal as we can, following out the policy adopted hitherto.

                            <para>- No. When it was proposed to carry telegrams relating to Commonwealth news at what is called the single rate, the rate we adopted was the lowest in Victoria and New South Wales, namely, from 8.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m., not exceeding ten words, sixpence ; for every additional word up to 34 words, 1/2 d. per word, and between 34 and 100 words, ls. 6d. When a message goes beyond 34 words, payment has to be made as for 100 words, and then for every additional 50 words, or portion thereof, sixpence. That is the rate I put in the Bill first of all. It appeared to me, however, that if we adopted that rate we should be charging ls. lid. for a message of 44 words, which according to our ordinary .Inter-State rate for press telegrams could go for ls. 6d. What I have done is this : I have taken the rate which we have been charging for Commonwealth telegrams, and I have reduced it again, so as to make the charge for the shorter telegrams the same as the charge for the ordinary press telegrams. The charge for a short message, up to 50 words will be the same as that for the ordinary press telegram. The difference is that for an ordinary Inter-State press telegram of 1.00 words a charge of 3s. is made, whereas for an Inter-State message conveying Commonwealth news it is only ls. 6d. per 100. If I had not made the alteration we should have been charging on a higher scale for short press telegrams relating to Commonwealth news than for the ordinary press messages. There has been no addition whatever, but a reduction in regard to short messages. </para>

A message going to Queensland would be charged one-third of the ordinary rate, because instead of being charged the Victorian, New South Wales and Queensland rate, it is conveyed over the three States at the single rate fixed in New South Wales and Victoria. I have made the rate lower seeing that we are proposing to take all press telegrams up to 100 words at a lower rate than that fixed by New South Wales and Victoria. </para>

						<para>- I should like the Postmaster-General to see whether it is not possible to further reduce the charge for telegrams relating to Commonwealth news. My reason for urging a further reduction is that it is advisable that the whole of the people of the Commonwealth should be cognisant, as far as possible, of what goes on in connexion with Federal Parliamentary matters.</para>

                            <para>- I am speaking from information conveyed to me. If the Minister says to a man in the office - " Go through this message and let us know whether it applies to a Minister or to an outside man," that officer, becomes practically a censor. I think it is a matter which is well worthy of consideration at the hands of the Postmaster-General. What is good for the Ministry or Opposition to-day will be good for the Ministry or the Opposition in time to come. </para>

                            <para>- The demand made by the newspapers is so wide that it really covers nearly everything. I think that the definition we have at the present time is a very reasonable concession to the general desire that outside States shall have full information of what is going on in the Federal Parliament. It would have been safer and better if we had adhered to the first understanding, that it was simply to cover reports of the proceedings in the Federal Parliament - that is to say, that the gentlemen of the press who are in our galleries should report what was done in Parliament, and send those reports away at the reduced rates. </para>

                            <para>- The demand now made apparently is, that representatives of the press may go round and button hole Ministers or other Members of Parliament, get information from them, and send it at this low rate. The rates we have in Australia for ordinary press telegrams between one State and another are very low indeed, and I do not think there is any justification for a further reduction of the rates proposed. The rates proposed here are phenomenally low, especially when it is considered that these messages are sent over half a continent. The rates are - not exceeding 25 words1s., exceeding 25 words, and not exceeding 100 words1s. 6d., which is half the very low rate we are charging at the present time for ordinary press telegrams and for every additional 50 words, or portion of 50 words 6d., which is only one-third of what we are charging for ordinary press telegrams; These rates are so very low that I think honorable senators should not press for any further concession. </para>

I think that the fullest possible information should be given to the press in connexion with our parliamentary duties. Of course, if a Minister takes a trip to Queenscliff for the benefit of his health, it would be absurd to telegraph that at the cheaper rate ; but where the matter is one in which the public are interested it is different. </para>
