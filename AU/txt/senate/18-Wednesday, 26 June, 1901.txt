        <para>Wales). - I take the earliest possible opportunity of drawing attention to what seems to be a very serious breach of the sessional order with reference to the meeting of the Senate. On Friday last a motion was moved without notice given, as positively required by the. standing orders under which we are working, by virtue of which a special meeting of the Senate was held yesterday. </para>

              <para>-If the Senate is to be of any value at. all in carrying on the business of the country, it must have the power to act in emergencies-. What an absurdity it would be if because some honorable senator, I have no doubt perfectly properly, to carry on his own business, did not happen to be here, and therefore had not an opportunity of objecting, those who were carrying on the business of the country had no right to say whether a special sitting should be held or not. I quite sympathize with the honorable senator in not being here. I quite admit that honorable senators have to be away on their own business, but, if they are away, I think they ought to be very careful about questioning the right of those who remain to do the business of the country acting within the standing orders. The honorable senator admits very fairly that the action was justified under the circumstances as a matter of fact. I have risen principally to point out that it was justified also under the sessional order, and I hope that whenever the occasion does arise the Senate will act by the senators who are here in what they think to be the best interests of the public without regard to persons anywhere, or of any kind. </para>

              <para>- Then the honorable senator was better than most of us. We had not the. slightest idea that any other business would come on, or that any unusual sitting of the Senate would take place. The first time I heard of the Senate sitting yesterday was when I was coming across in the train last night to attend the usual Wednesday sitting of the Senate. I am not complaining. When an emergency arises, every one should be glad to assist in doing everything possible in order that the business of the country may be proceeded with. But I do not wish to have the standing orders set at defiance. My honorable and learned friend says that he would do the same thing to-morrow if he thought it desirable: I hope he would not. I am quite sure that, inadvertently, the Postmaster-General overlooked the fact that, if he desired to deal with this matter at an unusual time, he should have asked for the suspension of the standing orders. He might have done that without notice. A week or two ago he gave notice of a contingent motion for the suspension of standing orders when the Supply Bill came up from the other Chamber. </para>

              <para>- That is where I think the mistake arises. I am speaking from my experience of the suspension of the standing orders in the Victorian Parliament. The suspension of the standing orders can be moved without notice at any time in Victoria, but any one member may object to it. I do not profess to know the South Australian standing orders, but I believe that such a motion could be carried by an absolute majority. There was certainly not an absolute majority in the Senate on Friday night. </para>

              <para>- With all due deference to the honorable and learned senator, I do not say it is wrong according to the South Australian standing orders, but it is an entirely novel feature to me. It appears to me to be surrounded with grave objections, and to open the door to senators being caught unawares. I do not suppose for one moment that Ministers would permit such a thing, but it is open for a Government which has for the time being a sufficient majority in the House to bring on suddenly and without proper notice an important measure and get it through. That is not desirable in the interests of proper legislation, and as far as I am aware it is contrary to the standing orders of the Senate. I recognise frankly that this was an emergency, and I am not going to blame the representative of the Government for what he did. Perhaps in similar circumstances I would have done the same thing, but I do not think it should be repeated. At all events it should only be repeated under exceptional circumstances, and it should not be taken up in the jaunty, off-hand manner in which the honorable and learned senator has put it. </para>

            <para>- The way in which we who manufactured these standing orders would conduct such business as this would be totally different from that which the leader of the Government here has suggested. It could not certainly be done without the suspension of the standing orders, and the standing orders could not be suspended without giving notice of motion. I have not the slightest knowledge of the sessional orders in regard to the time of meeting ever having been departed from without notice.Then the matter is discussed and a decision arrived at, and the House knows what it is about. In the present instance the course pursued was . exceedingly hard on those senators who live at a distance from Melbourne, like the representatives from South Australia and Tasmania and New South Wales. We left the chamber some little time after four o'clock, never dreaming for a moment that the sessional order for the meeting of the Senate on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of each week would be departed from. AVe never received the slightest information that it had been departed from. It was only when I got to the train in Adelaide yesterday afternoon that I was informed that some of our members had returned to Victoria on Monday, because of the fact that the Senate was to meet on Tuesday. I like to keep records myself, and one of the records that I desired to keep was that I should be able at the end of the session to say that I had attended every meeting of the Senate. My record, however, has been completely destroyed by the action of the Government. If circumstances warranted a departure from the sessional order, senators who had left Melbourne for their homes in the neighbouring States should have received a special wire notifying the alteration. I returned to my home in the Mount Lofty Ranges without hearing a word about the change, and I learned nothing about it until yesterday when I boarded the train. Then it was that I found that the record which I had hoped to be able to point to with some degree of pride and satisfaction had been broken through no fault of my own. I do not blame the Government in the circumstances, but I do blame them for not giving notice to those who had left. Certainly the Postmaster-General knew that a great many of us had left before this incident occurred, and I suppose it was simply due to want "of thought that we did not receive proper notice. If we have standing orders we ought to obey them. If anything of this sort is to be allowed; then the Ministry, at the fag end of a session, when there is barely a quorum of the Senate present, will have power to do just as they choose. They will be able to quietly get up and propose to meet on any day without giving notice to those senators who have left the Senate in the belief that the sessional orders will be obeyed. If we are going to allow this to happen whenever the Ministry chooses it will be a most objectionable procedure, and I shall protest against it with all my might. No advantage was gained by meeting on Tuesday. All that was done could have been done this afternoon, and there would not have been the slightest trouble. Nothing was gained by the meeting, and senators were brought here without any necessity. The Supply Bill is not wanted until the end of this month. </para>

All the auditing and the vouchers and the receipts for payments have surely been attended to. Even if the Bill had been passed a day before the end of the month there would have been ample time for payments all through the Commonwealth in these days of the telegraph and the quick transmission of messages. I trust that the Government will be exceedingly careful about departing from the sessional order, and that in future we shall receive proper notice. </para>

When I saw a telegram in the newspapers that the Senate would meet yesterday I assumed it was for the purpose of dealing with the Supply Bill and nothing more.'

              <para>- It used to be done in the Assembly when I was there, a very considerable time ago. Honorable senators will see that if the Senate decides that it cannot sit to meet some emergency on a different date or hour to that fixed by the sessional order, great difficulty may occur. 1 consider that the motion was strictly in accordance with the standing orders. It certainly was strictly in accordance with the practice of the Legislative Council with which I am most familiar, and I believe that in other State Legislatures a similar practice is followed. I do not desire to express any opinion whatever as to whether or not the Ministry exercised a wise discretion. That is not my business, but I do think that there was nothing out of "order in carrying the motion. </para>

I did not complain of his being away, and he need not complain of me being away for five minutes, when he was away for weeks. As far as my attendance was concerned, I am quite ready to prove that I, have not been away for one day except yesterday. My honorable and learned friend made a speech of a character that he knew was certain to be resented. He has got blue mouldy for want of a " bating," and he has come here with the idea of making a little theatrical display which may have some ulterior object in it, but which is entirely out of place. </para>

              <para>- No, certainly not. I do not remember whether the draft standing orders were thus referred to the committee. But that is by the way. The Standing Orders Committee were asked to recommend a form, of prayer to the Senate. They were never asked to recommend whether a permanent Chairman of Committees should be appointed. That is the point to which I wish to direct attention. The Senate never delegated to any Standing Orders Committee - who may or may not have been, unanimous ; I do not know whether they were or not - its own function of inquiring; into the desirability or necessity of appointing a permanent Chairman of Committees,, nor did it ask the committee to make a. recommendation on the subject. It is said that in framing the standing orders it would be difficult for the committee to proceed unless, they knew whether the Senate was determined to appoint a permanent Chairman of Committees or not. I quite appreciate that point of view. When that difficulty arose the committee might have reported to the Senate and asked that the question whether a permanent Chairman was to be appointed should be determined before the standing orders were drafted. </para>

              <para>- There will not be more to do in respect to the duties of the office of Chairman of Committees than there was in the Legislative Council of South Australia, where the provisions with regard to Money Bills are nearly the same as those which apply to this Senate. In my opinion there will be no more practical business to be done by the Chairman of Committees in this Senate than there was in the Legislative Council of South Australia. Then it is said that the dignity of this Chamber requires the appointment to be made. I am not one of those who consider that the dignity of the Senate is to be maintained by multiplying offices or appointing officers whose services are .not absolutely necessary. In the interest of economy I hold that at present there is no necessity for a Chairman of Committees to be appointed ; and until we see that there is such an overwhelming body of work as to make it undesirable or inconsistent with the other duties of the President that he should preside in committee, we need not appoint one. Do not let us be premature. We have passed through this Chamber the Appropriation Bill dealing with the salary of the Chairman of Committees in the event of one being elected. We have certainly not dealt in any ungenerous way with that salary. The sum of £500, in addition to the £400 which would be drawn by the Chairman as a senator - making £900 a year altogether - is certainly generous payment for the amount of work that would have to be done. Whatever may be the case this sestion, and however onerous the work that has to be dealt with, I feel certain that in future sessions four months in the year, rather than five or six, will satisfy the necessities of legislation. A salary of £900 a year" for four or five months' work would not be in conformity with those views and pledges which we gave when we were before our constituents seeking election to this Parliament. </para>

              <para>- What I am pointing out is that this is an unnecessary salary. If it is absolutely necessary that we should have a Chairman of Committees we must appoint one; but according to my view, this office seems to be unnecessary at the present stage of our proceedings, and involves an expenditure for duties that would only have to be discharged for some five or six months in the year, and which possibly in future will extend over a less period. On that account we ought to pay such regard to the pledges we have given as, at any rate, not to appoint a Chairman of Committees, unless we find that the volume of work in the Senate is so great as to .make it absolutely necessary for such an appointment to be made. </para>

We only meet three days a week, and there are five or six months in the year during which our own knowledge of constitutional lav/- can be rubbed up. It seems to me, therefore, that at this stage of our history as a Senate we may well pause before we determine that there shall be a permanent Chairman of Committees. Let us wait and see whether the work can be done otherwise. We want the business of the Senate to be conducted properly. Let us see whether it cannot be done without incurring this unnecessary expense. If it cannot be properly done I shall be one of the first to join in securing additional officers for the purpose. But at present it seems to me that we shall be - I will not say playing false, but at any rate receding from the views we have all expressed with regard to economy, in seeking to multiply officers and add to salaries without any urgent and immediate necessity. I for one shall be found recording my vote against the second paragraph of the Standing Orders Committee's report. </para>

Why, he comes in through the standing orders and nowhere else. Thus we have standing orders now which say there shall be a Chairman of Committees. </para>

              <para>- I say they would be novices as Chairmen of Committees. I take a novice to be a person who is new to the game, and if we are to have a number of temporary chairmen we must have a number of persons who are comparatively new to the game. I think, therefore, that when we look to the dignity of the Chamber, the amount of work to be done, our capability of doing it ; and when we look to the precedents afforded by the other States, there is nothing to justify us in coming to the conclusion that a salary of £500 a-year should not be voted to a permanent Chairman of Committees of this Chamber. </para>

With regard to the chairmanship, I understand that we enunciated the principle the other night of appointing a Chairman, and I cannot see any reason for changing my views. As regards the quorum in committee, that is a matter on which the Standing Orders Committee are well able to give us advice. We ought to proceed with the business, if we want to finish before Christmas. I thoroughly approve of the report. </para>

          <para>This is one of those necessary measures which form the beginning of our code of statute law under the Commonwealth. It is well known that in all systems of statute law nowadays what is called an Interpretation or Acts Shortening Act has become necessary. The object of an Act of that kind is this : In the first place, in any code of statute law there are a large number of phrases which are continually being used and it is very desirable that they should always be used with the same meaning. The Interpretation Act fixes that that meaning shall, unless the contrary intention is expressed, be the same in all Acts of Parliament to which the Interpretation Act refers. Certain phrases are also used which it is desirable should always have the same meaning attached to them unless the context of the Act is expressly different. There are also statutes for the interpretation of certain rules which are generally recognised and which are made statutory by measures of this kind. A similar Act has been in force in England for a great many years. This particular Bill is founded partly on the English Act, partly on the New South Wales Act, and also to some extent upon the Victorian and New Zealand Acts. There is nothing new in the Bill. Although there may be some new words introduced, the principle of it is well recognised in every code of laws and where there are statutes to be interpreted. It is not necessary to go into detail with regard to these provisions. The clauses, of course, will be considered in committee, and if any honorable senator thinks fit to call special attention to any particular provision I hope he will make his views known then. </para>

            <para>. - Honorable senator's will be aware that there is a rule of law that the Crown is not bound by any statute unless it is expressly named therein, or unless by necessary implication the rights of the Crown are involved.For that reason it is often a matter of very difficult construction as to whether a particular Act binds the Crown or not. As these interpretation words are to be stretched over a vast number of statutes dealing with all kinds of subjects, it is necessary in so far as they carry any meaning binding the Crown that that should be expressly declared in this Bill. I may mention also that in the English Act upon which this provision is founded these very words are used. </para>

Then there is the Constitution itself, which begins its numbering separately.What is no doubt intended here is first of all the Constitution of Australia Act, and then the Constitution. The honorable and learned senator will thus see that it is better to have them dealt with separately. </para>

This is an Interpretation Act, and the marginal note to the clause, which is intended for the guidance of honorable members, says the clause deals w wwith " constitutional and official definitions," that is, that the words following shall have a legal meaning if the clause is passed. I should like to have some explanation as to what that really means. The clause opens with the words - </para>

            <para>- We might say that "Parliament" shall mean the Parliament of the United Kingdom or the British Parliament. The latter would ' include the United Kingdom, with the exception of Ireland. That would be just as simple an expression as "Imperial Parliament." I think it would be a convenient term to use. "Imperial" implies power over all the Empire. </para>

            <para>- I do not think the words, " Imperial Parliament," or the word "British," would meet the meaning of either party. I think the term, " Parliament of the United Kingdom," would be much clearer. The word " Imperial" has gradually changed its meaning with the spread of the British Empire. I remember at the time that the late Queen Victoria was first designated Empress of India it was distinctly understood that that name should only apply to her as the Empress of India. The use of the word "Imperial" here would convey to my mind that the Imperial Parliament is the controlling power over the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>- I think it ought to be provided in this clause that any document which is to be served by post should be registered. The mere fact that a letter is posted is not evidence that it has been delivered. Cases have been known of letters not being delivered for years after they were posted. I think some provision as to registration ought to be inserted here. </para>

              <para>- We are talking about 'two different things. This clause simply deals with the posting of the letter, and not the receiving of it. All that could be gained by such an amendment would be that you would have to prove registration as well as posting, and there might be difficulties in the way of proving that. Say a man is engaged in some work out in the back blocks, and he wants to accept an offer to sink a tank. He may post that offer at the nearest post-office, but there might not be facilities for registration. </para>

          <para>SenatorEWING. - No; but it says where an Act authorizes or requires any document to be served, that service is to be service by post. We might pass a law imposing a land tax, and it would be necessary to serve the notices of assessment or to serve them by post. Surely it is a fair thing to ask the authority which sends these notices, on which so much depends, to take the trouble to register them. </para>

              <para>- That is done by proving that some one takes the summons. If I serve a summons upon some person my evidence to that effect proves that I have served it. Whatever we do in the way of legislation, we should be practical. To lay down a hard and last rule that all documents posted in so vast a territory as that of Queensland should be registered, would be impracticable. But, on the other hand, . it would be possible to single out certain documents and require that they should be registered. Documents in regard to a man's vote, for instance, should be registered, even though long distances have to be travelled for the purpose. What I object to is laying down a hard and fast rule with regard to all documents which have to be delivered in so large a territory as that of Queensland. There, for instance, we have no less than 800 polling places, and the inconvenience attached to delivering documents is so great that in some cases it takes a whole month before you can reach a certain place.. A certain discretion should be exercised with regard to documents which are important. It may be necessary to show that such documents have been actually delivered and have reached the person. The best means of proving that is by registration. But to say that documents are to be registered in every case would not work out in a practical manner. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that we have wandered a long way from what the clause refers to. The clause does not determine what documents are important or unimportant. It does not legislate as to what documents can be served by post. It merely enacts what is the ordinary every day practice in every court of justice which any of us are acquainted with. When you have to prove that somebody has received a letter, the evidence you give is that somebody posted a letter. </para>

              <para>- It can. That is one of the contingencies that may possibly occur in connexion with all human affairs. Wc cannot make sure that all letters posted are received by those to whom they are sent. If we imposed a regulation such as that with regard to registration in connexion with the millions of letters that are posted every day, the business of the world could not be carried on. Undoubtedly at the option of the sender of a letter the document may be registered. Then you get a receipt back which proves that the letter has been received. If you are sending a remittance for instance, the receipt satisfies you that the person who was intended to receive the letter does receive it - unless there has been a fraud. This clause merely expresses in an enactment the same rule which applies to the millions and millions of letters posted every day throughout ' the British Empire and throughout the world; and that rule enables the receipt to be proved unless the person to whom the letters are issued proves the contrary. </para>

I think I have shown that there are many cases where postal service is convenient, and where the proof as required by this clause is all that is necessary. It is our place as senators to see that the Bill is passed in a way that will not permit of injury or inconvenience arising. Unless we leave the clause as it is we can never have the postal service of any notice, unless it is clearly shown that the effect of this clause is embodied in the Act itself. </para>

I admit that I have never seen it before, but if you do not use that expression you will have to use the words " Year of the reign of the Sovereign in whose reign it was passed." The sub-clause would then read " any Imperial Act may be cited by the short title (if any) or by reference to the year of the reign of the Sovereign in. whose reign it was passed." Technically the clause could not be touched now, but it could be reconsidered later on. </para>

            <para>- A "postal article," as will be seen by the definition clause, includes even a telegram. We do not want to use a term that is wider than the necessity of the case requires, and at the present time I cannot see exactly what advantage is to be gained by the amendment. As it stands, it will only mean that instead of using the word "letter" it is enlarged to include a packet or parcel that may contain coin. Speaking on the spur of the moment, I am not sure whether a packet or parcel containing coin can bo registered. We have six different Acts and six different regulations, and it is fixed by regulations what kind of postal article can be registered. </para>

            <para>- But the possibility is - I cannot speak from knowledge at present - that nothing but a letter containing coin can be registered. The probability is that the regulations provide that coin cannot be transmitted in a parcel or package, and if that is so there is no necessity to make the amendment. I think there are reasons why coin cannot be transmitted through the post-office in packets or packages, and if coin can only be sent in a letter then there is no need to provide that if it is sent in a packet or package or postal article except a letter, then it must be registered. </para>

          <para>- It appears to me that this clause is consequential on the previous one. Clause 36 provides that letters containing valuable enclosures must be registered and it uses exactly the same words - " registered letter or packet" - as are used here. And then clause 37 provides what is to be done in the event of those letters being missing. It appears to me that clause 37 must necessarily recite exactly the same terms as are contained in the preceding clause. It appears to me to be perfectly correct. . </para>

            <para>-I think the best way will be to make the clause read : " Any person making a complaint that an unregistered letter or packet containing coin or jewellery," and so on. That would be the better way ; because we cannot admit that a person who puts valuables into a postal article he cann ot register should have a right to an inquiry. The insertion of the words " or packet" would meet the case. </para>

In Tasmania our postal regulations have always allowed us to post letters and packets containing articles of a dutiable nature, and the customs duty has been collected at the post-office by arrangement with the Customs authorities. </para>

          <para>- The point alluded to by the honorable senator is dealt with in clause 48. The practice is as follows : - Where a letter containing dutiable articles is sent through the post office, a notice is sent to the addressee, telling him that a letter, which apparently contains dutiable articles, is lying at the post-office. He attends, and the packet is opened in his presence. If it contains dutiable articles, the duty is assessed by a Customs house officer, and the person to whom the packet is addressed pays the duty. The packet is then delivered to him, except where there is reason to believe that it has been posted with a deliberate attempt to' contravene the Customs Act. In that case, the matter is handed over to the Commissioner of Customs, for him to deal with it as he chooses. </para>

          <para>- When we have free-trade between the States there will be no necessity for this provision, as far as concerns the Commonwealth ; because a letter or package cannot possibly contain anything upon which duties of customs are payable, if posted within the Commonwealth. Therefore, the clause can only be meant to apply to articles which are sent through the post from foreign countries. I understand that this clause refers to postal articles received at any post-office in the Commonwealth from abroad. There is a well-recognised manner of dealing with them, at any rate in the State of South Australia. They are, when received, handed over to a Customs house-officer. He opens the packets to see if they contain anything dutiable. If they do, he sends a notice to the person to whom they are addressed saying that he can receive them when he pays duty upon them. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that we should facilitate this sort of thing. It has never been looked upon as contravening an Act to send for an article to the old country. Why should I not be able to send a remittance to London, and get a watch by parcels post, paying duty upon it according to its value? In South Australia every provision is made for such a proceeding. A Customs officer is specially told off to examine the articles sent out by parcels post. I cannot see why we should provide that an article so sent is posted " in contravention of this Act." If it is to be so, -what is the penalty to be inflicted? </para>

            <para>- I am quite willing to amend the clause in order to provide that such a letter shall be sent to the principal post-office of the State, so that it may be dealt with by the Deputy Postmaster-General. That would be exactly the same practice as has existed in the past. We cannot open the post-office as a channel by which dutiable goods may be pissed through. It would be entirely unfair to the Minister in charge of the Customs department to do that. It is no use to put import duties upon articles if we say that a person may send any amount of dutiable articles through the post-office, and that they will never be checked. That seems to be perfectly unreasonable. </para>

That is the first step. The next step is as to what is to be done with that letter. The Bill says that it is to be sent to the General Post-office. That means the General Post-office of the State. There it is examined, and if it is found to contain dutiable .articles it is supposed to be posted in contravention of the Act. These words are used in order to enable it to be stopped by the post-office, and the next step is that under clause 39 the letter shall be sent to the General Post-office, the head office of the State. </para>

            <para>- Yes; but it would never do to send these letters up to branch offices. It is well known that in Victoria attempts have been made to smuggle valuable diamonds through the post, and it is in order to prevent the enclosure of these valuable articles in postal packages so as - to avoid payment of duty that this power is necessary. I have often had letters sent through the post-office in this way, and there has been no difficulty. A printed notice is sent to the addressee, and the addressee either goes himself, or if he is living in the country he sends some one else, say, in Melbourne to the post-office to pay the duty, if any. The only point is that it is not quite clear whether, under clause 4S, the duty can be enforced, unless it be under sub-clause (2). I think that clause 4S might be made much clearer by distinctly stating that the article shall not be given up unless duty be paid. </para>

            <para>- If the Postmaster-General says no, then I say that in this particular clause he has inserted a provision which will prevent them coming in. The clause I speak of refers to articles being posted in contravention of the Act. By that the honorable and learned gentleman intends to stop, these things corning in. If they are posted in contravention of the Act, then penalties should be inflicted. If the Postmaster-General is going to make it part of his policy to prevent dutiable goods being sent through the parcel post, I do not think we should allow th goods to be given up. to the addressees. It would be better to adopt the system in vogue in my own State, and also in the State of Western Australia, under which valuable articles are sent in parcels through the post, on which are written a statement of their contents and the value placed upon them. They are never sent to up-country post offices at all. They are always detained at the General Post-office, where they are examined by a Customs house officer sent by the Treasury. I have known cases of attempted fraud, but where we have officers, specially appointed to examine packages, if they have any doubt, they open them and value them. By that means people have been able to get jewellery, fancy goods, presents, and articles of various descriptions sent by their friends through the post, when those articles were of a dutiable character. There 1ms been no difficult}'. A great many of the packages are examined, so that no fraud can possibly be perpetrated. The system has been of great convenience to the people, and I do not see why it should be put a stop to. Under this clause we do put a stop to it. </para>

            <para>- The prescribed manner is the manner as prescribed by the regulations. The regulations prescribed in Queensland are exactly the same as those prescribed in South Australia. Postal articles apparently containing dutiable goods are sent to the Postmaster-General. The Postmaster-General causes a printed notice to be sent to the addressee, telling him there is a letter or package lying at the post-office supposed to contain dutiable goods. The addressee attends at the post-office, and the article is opened in his presence by the Customs officer. If it contains dutiable articles the value is assessed by the Customs officer, and if the addressee chooses to pay the duty he can take away .the article then and there. </para>

            <para>- Yes. That is the distinction I pointed out at first. If there is suspicion of fraud ; if it is suspected that there has been a deliberate attempt to defraud the Customs, the Postmaster-General will deal with the matter in quite a different way. He will have to inform the Customs department, and they will take any action they see fit. The practice of putting a declaration on the package itself that it contains duitable articles, should where adopted remove the suspicion of an attempt to evade customs duties. </para>

          <para>- The Postmaster-General has declared that it is not intended to legalize the transmission of dutiable goods through the post. Now,, we desire that the Bill shall be framed in such a way that it shall be legal to send' these goods through the post under certain restrictions. That seems to be the practice in nearly every State, and it is a most convenient practice. I will explain' how it happens to be convenient. A small package; is sent to some person as a. present, say a letter case for the pocket. "Unless it is sent through the post it has to be sent through an agent in London, if it is purchased there, and he puts it in a case with a lot of other packages which he collects. He then sends a notice to say he has received a parcel for you, and he charges you agency fees in addition to the customs duties, and he sometimes detains the parcel till all the other owners have signed their declarations and the whole of the contents of the package is free. I speak from absolute experience, because I received a parcel from London only the other day. It was a very small parcel, and it came through an agent, and I had to wait three or four days before I could get delivery, because the owners of the other packages did not take the same prompt steps to get their goods cleared. We want to have the transmission of dutiable goods through the post-office made absolutely legal, and if the Postmaster-General can see his way to strike out the words "deemed to be posted in contravention of the Act," I think the whole difficulty wiil be got over. </para>

A man, for the sake of a few pounds, is not going to make a false declaration ; and if he is prepared to make a false declaration, we know that he can pass thousands of pounds worth through the Customs in spite of the agent. So that I think we should place some reliance on the declaration made. Let us take Peak Hill, in West Australia. It would take a man a fortnight to receive his notice from the post-office that the goods that were addressed to him" at Peak Hill were lying in Perth, and then he would have to reply. </para>

The Postmaster-General would be empowered by the regulations to have the duty assessed by the Customs house officer, and the article would then be sent on to the addressee, who would know that he would have to pay so much duty, and if he were dissatisfied it would be a matter of appeal. </para>

            <para>- No ; and the Postmaster-General would be instructed not to deliver the parcel until the duty was paid. This idea is carried out every day. Any number of parcels are coming from London to all the States, and why should we not encourage the sending of parcels by post? It is a very paying business for the department. We make regulations to receive and to send parcels from and to all parts of the world, and yet we are asked to say by law that it is illegal. </para>

            <para>- But it was suppressed, and it is no earthly use denying it. I am not blaming the Government of the Commonwealth, but the Victorian Government have suppressed it in a most underhand fashion. If they had done the thing publicly and in a manly way, the offence would have been palliated in a slight degree, but they, resorted to this underhand fashion of suppressing a newspaper without saying a word about it. When the booksellers went for their consignments, they were told that they had been seized by the Customs anddestroyed. </para>

It is impossible for him to be everywhere throughout the length and breadth of Australia,.and surely it is reasonable when we have persons discharging official duties in whom we have confidence, that those persons should have power to act for the Postmaster-General. In regard to the matter of opening letters that is of much more serious moment. I .think honorable senators will see that power should be given to suppress obscene papers. </para>

          <para>- I. am quite in agreement with the utterances of those senators who are opposing this amendment. I think we ought to make our legislation with regard to these particular matters as harmonious as possible. If senators will turn back to clause 27 they will find that subclause (3) provides that any posted newspaper found to contain seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter may be destroyed by order of the Postmaster-General, not by order of any deputy. Of course it may be pointed out that, so far as this clause is concerned, there is a distinction inasmuch as this one refers to indecent, libellous, or offensive matter written or drawn on the outside. Unless the Postmaster-General has eyes which will enable him to see without the assistance of X rays into a newspaper, he will not be able to exercise the power conferred on him, by clause 27. Of course there might be some outward indication on the paper which would help him. </para>

            <para>- He may open a newspaper and many other packets and letters which are supposed to be posted in contravention of the provisions of the Act. I should like to see this power vested only in the Postmaster-General, so that our legislation in this particular respect shall be harmonious. If such a power, allowing so wide a discretion to the individual by whom it is going to be exercised, is reposed in six different officers we cannot hope for anything like uniformity. This is a very comprehensive clause. Some of the terms used are very sweeping, and would be construed very differently by different men. I doubt if we would get any two Deputy Postmasters-General who would construe at once some of these words in a precisely similar way. There is one word here which is very extensive in its signification, and that is the word " offensive." What is offensive ? One Postmaster-General might construe as actually harmless something which another considered highly offensive. </para>

I would certainly like to see that word struck out. </para>

There cannot be any great harm done. A Deputy Postmaster-General may have power to detain postal articles and submit them to the Postmaster-General, but the Postmaster-General should be the ultimate authority, unless the provision is particularly confined to the word "blasphemy" - and that word should be defined - and to what is really obscene or filthy. If it is confined in that way there could be no objection to the power being given. </para>

            <para>- That is not the point at all. I am arguing on the proposed amendments, not on the general principle of the clause as to who shall have the authority to suppress anything of an offensive, blasphemous, libellous, or slanderous character that is going through the post-office. I have no objection to the Postmaster-General and one Deputy Postmaster-General exercising this authority, but I certainly object to half-a-dozen doing it, and that is why I object to the business being carried on in this way. I think a particular Deputy Postmaster-General should be named by the Minister, and that is the only one in authority in his absence. </para>

          <para>- I understand that some honorable senators wish to move further amendments, and while affording them an opportunity of doing so I desire to explain that I certainly object to the general principle contained in this clause, inasmuch as I think it gives the Postmaster-General and any Deputy Postmaster-General, as it now stands, too much power altogether. I do not think they should have a right to interfere with the correspondence of the people in the way it is proposed. I think a feature of British liberty is that in the Postal department there is to be trust, secrecy, and honour ; and that which distinguishes us as Britishers from Continental people is that when a man writes a letter, or has any communication to make by post to a friend in any part of the British dominions, he is absolutely certain that once he puts the letter in the post-office it will not be interfered with by any British official. I do not think the Federal Parliament ought to start upon its career- by teaching our people to have no faith in our postal system. We shall certainly do so by giving this power to the Postmaster-General or any Deputy Postmaster-General. I understand that we have to judge of these matters by experience ; and we have to gauge the intentions of those in authority who bring down a Bill to the Senate by the marginal note they put opposite each clause. What is the marginal note to this clause? It is - "Power to open letters." </para>

            <para>- It may mean this, that if the honorable gentleman in charge of the Postal department had a particular objection to myself he might destroy my letters, and I would have no remedy against him. I would particularly draw attention to this fact, you have to judge of the powers given to a Minister by experience. That has been our experience in Queensland. We had a strike - a very bitter and prolonged one - feeling ran very high, the military was brought out, and both parties fought very bitterly and strongly against each other. Any letters sent to any one of the strike officials were opened by the post - office officials, and it is after an experience of that kind that I object to giving this power. </para>

It is not a provision which ought to be embodied in a Post and Telegraph Act.
