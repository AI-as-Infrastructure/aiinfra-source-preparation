                    <para>- I certainly agree with what the Postmaster-General has said as to the opinion entertained that this Bill is really not necessary. Of course, if any doubt exists on the subject it is well to set it at rest, and I shall be glad to assist in that direction. But it is a mistake to anticipate doubts or difficulties. It would be better to wait, if there is any doubt, until some concrete instance arises in which an obstruction shows itself to the ordinary administration of justice. </para>

                    <para>- I understand that this Bill is wanted to confer jurisdiction to hear and punish misdemeanours and felonies, not so much on a State Supreme Court as on a court of summary jurisdiction. In some cases the magistrates derive their jurisdiction from statutes, and a doubt has arisen in reference to their powers. In several measures, such as the Post and Telegraph Act, the Immigration Restriction Bill, and the Pacific Island Labourers Bill, we conferred rather large powers on courts of summary jurisdiction, and it is thought better to put an end to any doubt by passing this Bill. The only question is whether it ought to be made retrospective. Retrospective legislation is always objectionable ; but if ever there was an occasion when it would not be objectionable, it is when the system of Government is being changed. During the interregnum it may transpire that there is not jurisdiction given to try certain offences. It therefore appears to me that it might be just as well to provide that this measure shall take effect as though it had been passed at the date when certain departments were taken over. </para>

                        <para>- It is arguable that way, but something is to be said on the other side. The courts dislike retrospective legislation, and hardly ever give effect to it unless it is manifest on the face of the statute. I mention the point for what it is worth. </para>

                    <para>- I think so. The argument of the honorable senator is that it is necessary to pass this Bill because in one State, which he does not specify, the authorities may not wish to carry the provisions of the Commonwealth law into effect. He, therefore, argues that if there is a doubt, it is better to make it clear, especially in regard to that State. </para>

As the offence was committed in a post-office it was argued by counsel that the post-office was federal territory, and, that therefore, the accused could not be tried for an offence committed in the State.

                    <para>- Subclause (2) provides that the salary of a probationary officer shall be increased to .Â£50 per annum "at the expiration of not less than six months." Very often provisions of this kind lead to an officer being kept in probation for a considerable time, extending sometimes to years. That is manifestly unfair. We should in this legislation say exactly what we mean. If the probationary term is to be six months we should say so, in order that the officer may know exactly what will accrue him at the end of that term. I had occasion to deal with this very matter iri my own State, in a case -where a railway servant had been on probation for nearly four years. I was obliged to ask the Railways Commissioner when the probationary term of such an officer was to come to an end. The commissioner very wisely said that he agreed that the time had arrived when this officer should either leave the service or be appointed permanently. In the interests of the departments and the officers engaged in them, the probationary period ought to be fixed. I therefore move - </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General is absolutely correct in his reading of the proposed amendment. So far from encouraging those on probation to do their best and show themselves worthy of a rise, it will have absolutely the opposite effect, because a young fellow coming in will know that so long as he jogs along in a not altogether discreditable manner, he will get a rise at the end of. six months. That is not the way to bring out a young fellow's best parts. We want to encourage every officer to do his best in the interest of the public who have to pay him. If the amendment is carried, I think the ultimate result will be to fill the department with mere drones. </para>

                <para>Sentor DOBSON (Tasmania).- The clause we are now considering is the most important in the Bill. I regret that the ' Postmaster-General has not seen fit to state the probable financial result of the clause, so that the honorable senators and the taxpayers might know in what direction this legislation is "tending. So far as I understand it, it tends in the direction of gross extravagance. The clause fixes the minimum salary of males and females at the same rate. For the first time in our colonial legislation men and women are to be put side by side as of equal value. The minimum laid down is to apply also to the general division, and I desire to arrest the attention of my brother senators in order that I may let them understand, if I can, what they are doing. Let me say that the increased sum which will require to be- added to the Estimates to pay salaries at the minimum rates set forth will, in the Postmaster-General's department alone, amount to Â£45,770. </para>

                        <para>- The increases referred to in sub-clause 5 are the increases of Â£20 per annum, and the first increase is an increase of Â£10, so .that it is really only an increase of Â£10, which can be affected by Senator Glassey's amendment, and it will give no power to waste the money of the Commonwealth to any great extent. We have debarred probationers from the exercise of political influence, and have prevented their representatives getting up in Parliament and asking why increases are not given. But we have not debarred the exercise of social influence, and those who may be able to bring- it to bear may get their increases at the end of six months, whether they are competent or not. We should either make it a hard and fast rule that men who are shown to be incompetent shall be discharged from the service, or transferred to some other department ; or we should provide that they shall get the increase of Â£10 at the end of twelve months at least. I shall support the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- It appears to me that there is a danger, between those who object to this provision as being too liberal and those who object to it as not being liberal enough, of getting no Bill at all. First of all an amendment is moved that extends the liberality of the clause, and provides that an increase must be given in six months. Then that amendment is withdrawn in favour of another, which proposes to extend the time from six months to twelve. If amendments are to be debated as we have been debating them, I do not see what prospect there is of getting the Bill through. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, we should go slow at first. There is no reason why we should not amend this Bill in a year or two if it is found to require amendment. At present I think the proposal of the Government is reasonable enough. I grant, that in a hot climate special consideration, must be given, but that can be given by the Minister in administering the department. If I were a young man I would not go to work in Cairns for double the money that would satisfy me in Melbourne. I hope the committee will pass the clause as it stands. If the Bill is made too liberal, we shall increase the difficulties of the general public, especially of the farmers and others who have to slave morning and night for a mere pittance. </para>

For example, supposing a letter-carrier receiving Â£120 a year, having qualified by examination, be transferred to the clerical division, according to my reading of the clause he would have to commence in the clerical division at Â£110 a year. A similar question had to be settled in connexion with the Public Service Act in Victoria, and a special provision was inserted to meet the difficulty. It was as follows : - </para>

                        <para>-- I know that my honorable and gallant friend has been interviewed by a number of pretty young ladies in regard to this matter. I have been seen by one or two of them myself, and have been compelled to steel my heart against them ; because I believe that it would be unjust and against the interests of the females themselves to pay them salaries equal to those received by male employes. I have taken some trouble to inquire into this matter, and I have been informed by the head of one of our departments that one male employe is worth two women. Those of us who favour this proposal have agreed, however, that to provide that the salaries paid to females shall be one-third and not one-half less than that paid to men would be a fair thing. A female remains in the one position in the service, but a boy advances from stage to stage and gains experience which the female employe does not. A male can be put to any kind of work, but a woman cannot. Special arrangements have to be made for her, and there is an objection to her working after hours and on Sundays. She enters the service, and, if she is lucky enough to receive an offer of marriage, away she goes and some one else takes her place. A man, however, makes his duties in the service his life's work. When he marries there is an additional incentive for him to seek to advance in the service. I am not going to enter into the question of whether women can do the work as well as men. In many instances a woman, can, and in many cases she pan do better work than a man. That, however, is not the question. The proposal in this Bill is to reverse the policy in force* in all the States with the exception of New South Wales, where they attempt to place, women in the service on the same level as. men. I have before me a return relating to some of the salaries paid in the Victorian civil service. It shows that male typewriters received a minimum salary of Â£96 per annum, and a maximum of Â£144: per annum, and female typewriters a minimum salary of Â£54 per annum, and a maximum of Â£78 per annum. Female typewriters who are also shorthand writers receive a minimum of Â£90 per annum, and a maximum of Â£108 per annum. Honorable senators will see the great difference between the salaries paid to males and females. So far as female typewriters and shorthand, writers are concerned, I think a great injustice is done to them. That a female who can use her typewriting machine and write shorthand - an art to which she has devoted, great study - should receive a maximum of.' only Â£108 per annum, while the ordinary male typewriter is paid Â£144 per annum,, is unjust. But where men and women are doing the same class of work, it is not right that females should receive the same salary as the men. I have other figures, showing that in every State a marked difference is made in regard to the salaries of males and females in the public service. Does it not stand to reason that a female simply enters the service as a matter of convenience. She may remain there 25 years, or she may not stop there 25 weeks, because she may marry and become a mother. It is far better that she should do so than spend all her life in the service. A man, however, spends his life in the service and gains a better training. </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the amendment now moved is consistent with the contention that has been made by some honorable senators that a woman and a man snould be put upon an exact equality in regard to salary received. It may incidentally happen that a woman may obtain a salary equal to, or greater than, that which a man gets, but on the average it is an undoubted fact that the salaries paid to women have been less than those paid to men for the same class of work. Whether that practice is based upon the supposed inferiority of. the female sex is another question. This clause only refers to the full amount of the prescribed increase being paid to a woman as well as to a man. That is to say, if a, woman who is doing certain work is found not to be performing it as satisfactorily as. a man, she will not get the same increase as she would otherwise receive. It is left open for the commissioner to say whether a woman is doing the work as well as a man, and if she is, she will get the same increase of salary as a man. If a woman is not capable of doing the same work as a man, she should not receive the same amount of salary. That is all the clause means. The commissioner's power as to certifying in regard to due and meritorious service applies both to males and females. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot agree with this amendment. We must remember that at the start this commissioner will be dealing with from 10,000 to 12,000 public servants, and a great number of them will be promoted from year to year and will have their salaries increased. It is altogether degrading the commissioner to suppose that he will not honestly determine such a question. It would be a perfect farce to call upon an officer occupying such a position to report in writing to the Governor-General upon so trivial a matter. If we cannot find a man whom we can trust to honestly perform his duty it would be almost better to have no Public Service Commissioner at all. </para>

                        <para>- This is not the first reference that has been made in connexion with this clause to clause 25, which was inserted in the Bill after it was introduced. I shall have something to say about it later. I do not think that we ought to alter this clause in order to make it agree with clause 25, though it may be necessary to alter clause 25 to bring it a little more into accord with clause 21. Sub-clause (6) goes in this matter about as far as we ought to go. The provision for three years in the service and one year in the division is not unreasonable. I have opposed those who have desired to interfere in any way with the provision for a minimum salary. With regard to the clerical division, this minimum salary of Â£110 means a considerable and sudden increase to a number of officers, and will involve an expenditure of about Â£11,000, but I do not propose to do anything in the direction of reducing the liberal provision of the clause. I think, however, that honorable senators should not make an effort to extend the provision. If they strike out the safeguards and qualifications at present in the clause they may run the risk of losing it altogether. It must be admitted that in comparison with the scale of remuneration and increases which obtains in the States at the present time, this is a very liberal clause, and I trust honorable senators will not move in the direction of removing any of its safeguards. </para>

                        <para>- It is well that the committee should be clear on the point. I am strongly opposed to this examination. It is manifestly unfair that men and women who have been in the service for a number of years, and some of whom passed an examination in years gone by, should be required to pass this examination in order to obtain a minimum wage, without any advancement so far as their position in the service is concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the great bulk of officers in the Post and Telegraph department are in the fifth class. They are the men who are receiving less than Â£110. There are also a large number of women who have been in the service for five, ten, and even twenty years. Is it fair to require these persons to pass a prescribed examination before they shall be entitled to receive the minimum wage prescribed in this Bill? In 1897, when we were amending the Civil Service Act of Queensland, I was fortunate enough to secure the insertion of an amendment providing that all persons who had been in the post and telegraph service prior to the passing of our first Civil Service Act in 1889, should be entitled to advance in the service without passing any examination. That benefited 157 persons in the service. </para>

                    <para>- I have not sufficient knowledge of the State Acts to speak with any certainty as to the reason for the distinction between the general division and the clerical division. It seems that it is regarded as necessary for those who are going into the clerical division to enter at a certain age, at all events to enter pretty low down, and after they have been a number of years in the service, they are held to have made up their minds whether they are going to remain in the general or clerical divisions. That I take it must be the meaning of this provision. If a man wishes to be transferred to the clerical division he must start at Â£110, which, of course, would mean that he starts as a comparatively young man, before he has become fixed in any groove. I shall inquire of my honorable colleague whether there is any well grounded reason for this provision, or whether it is the result of an inadvertence, and if the Bill can be amended in such a way, without detriment to the public service, as to allow for freer transfer from the general to the clerical division I shall have it recommitted for that purpose ?

                    <para>- In my second reading speech I said that this clause was inserted in the Bill in the other House after a comparatively short debate. It corresponds to the latter part of clause 21. We thoroughly discussed clause 21, and I think the feeling is that we are justified in making that provision with regard to the clerical division, but it is open to question whether clause 25, with regard to the general division, does not go too far. because with regard to officers generally it gives too large and too sudden an increase, and also because a fear has been, very freely expressed that if by statute we put men and women on an equality, as far as pay is concerned, the result eventually will be that there will be less employment for women. In almost every walk of life in which women have found employment, their number has been constantly increasing for many years, 'but the wages they have been able to command have not been equal to those paid to men. And outside, if not inside the service, the lower rate has accounted to a great extent in the direction of continually increasing the number of women employed. There are certain circumstances which .place women under a disqualification as compared with men. It is continually growing in all branches of the service in which -they are employed. For instance, special accommodation has to be provided for them, and then we cannot call upon women to work at hours when we can call upon men. In various other ways also it is found that women are subject to certain natural disqualifications. However, much it may. be regretted, the result is that they command lower salaries than men, and if by statute we raise the amount of salary paid to women to an equality with that paid to men, then, if a choice is allowed as between men and women, that choice will almost invariably fall upon the men. There are certain classes of work in which women are expert, but, generally speaking, in nearly all the work in which they are competing with men at the same salaries, the men will be preferred ; and if we make a rigid rule that the same salary' shall be paid to women as to men, there will be .a constantly decreasing amount of work for women. As to the financial effect of this clause, I would point out what will be the result in the Post and Telegraph department of increasing salaries to Â£110, so far as concerns those who have been three years in the service, and who have attained the age of 21 years. In the clerical division, it would affect 50.6 employes, and would mean an increased amount to be voted on the Estimates of Â£10,638. If the same rule is applied in the general division - and that is the operation of clause 25Â° - there will be i;375 employes affected. </para>

                        <para>- The question of the worth of their services does not enter into 'the matter. What is proposed is a statutory provision that the salaries shall be increased to Â£110 whether the services rendered are worth it or not. , The question of the value of the services does not arise. Will it be approved of by the community generally, by those who are outside the service, by many who would be glad to have the same position at Â£60 per year, and by the people who are furnishing the money out of which these salaries are paid, if these salaries are increased from Â£60 to Â£110 by the Legislature? I do not believe that at the time this matter was discussed in another place these facts were brought fully before honorable members. At any rate it is for the committee to consider the matter. With regard to the employment of females, I may remark that it has come under my notice once or twice already, that ladies are under certain disabilities in their employment, and if Parliament says that the same rate of salary is to be fixed for women as for men, indifferently, it will be found that in the future there will be a constantly decreasing number of women employed. Of course every female employe now in the service is in favour of this proposal. They do not consider the case of the young girls who are coming along and who want to get into the service. Those who are in are all right and are, of course, willing to accept any increase of salary which may be given to them. But what I am endeavouring to point out is that the effect of raising these salaries of women by statute to an equality with the salaries of men will in the long run be to diminish the amount of employment for women in the service. That is a result which I should deplore. The amendment I intend to move will prevent the clause from making such a sweeping alteration, which I do not think was intended when it was accepted in another place. I move - </para>

                        <para>- It is like dragging in the poor widow and the orphan in connexion with a great many other things. The people of Australia are to a great extent composed of poor women in calico dresses, having poor husbands in moleskin trousers, and as far as concerns letters from England and other parts of the world, these people are not very anxious as to whether they get their correspondence at the end of 30, 40, or 50 days. But for the sake of business people - the mercantile community - the State is prepared at the expense of the poor woman in her calico dress, and her poor husband in his moleskin trousers, to pay immense subsidies to ocean steam-ship companies in order that the mails may be delivered a few days sooner. So far as the difference of a few days is concerned, the poor men and women are very little interested, but they do not complain because merchants and business men have got their letters a few days sooner at a cost of Â£72,000, which is nearly twice as much as would be necessary to give the increases here asked for. The Postmaster-General, in appealing on behalf of the poor young women, was careful to refer, not to those who are in the service, but to those who expect to get into it. The honorable and learned senator said it would make a great difference to them, because if the department was compelled to pay them Â£110 after they had been three years in the service, and were 21 years of age, the result would be that they would not be employed. Is not that something like a threat ? </para>

                        <para>- I say they will ! They would not be employed now if those who employ them were not getting value for their money. If these women were not assisting to keep down the wages paid to men they would not be employed at all. It is not out of sympathy that the women are employed, and the women of Australia have common sense enough to know it. But let us get this provision passed, and then, when an application for a position is put in by either a boy or a girl, it will be our duty to see that both get fair play, in spite of any arbitrary officer who may have threatened that if ...... is carried he will take care that no woman gets employment.. I jocularly  remarked that if the wages of these young men who are over 21 years of age were increased from Â£60 or Â£70 to Â£110 a year and upwards, they would be in a better position than they are in to-day, and there would be far more opportunities for the young women of Australia to get married. We often see in the press pathetic articles and letters complaining of the low marriage rate and birth rate. We have to think of these things when we are increasing the salaries of men. If they are given salaries sufficient to enable them to get married it will be better for them and for the women of the Commonwealth also. For all these reasons, and many more I could advance, this clause should be passed without any amendment. </para>

                        <para>- At all events, we must take that into consideration ; and while the estimate of the extra amount of expenditure in the Post and Telegraph department is Â£34,770, within twelve months from now the extra expenditure required to carry out this provision will much more closely approximate to Â£50,000 per annum. That is a very substantial sum to have to provide for, and in the case of Tasmania, - Western Australia, and South Australia it means an extra expenditure, which will certainly be an important item in the finances of those States. It would be a pleasure to every honorable senator to be able to vote for these advances if we had the necessary funds ; but. the predominating consideration in connexion with Australian finance at the present moment, and for some time to come, must be caution. </para>

                    <para>- If this clause is passed as it stands the Commonwealth will be committed to an increased expenditure of Â£50,000 per year. It is, I think, very undesirable that this small committee should calmly vote for additional expenditure to that extent. Whatever may be the decision upon this question I think it ought to be arrived at in as full a committee as possible.

                        <para>- I do not wish at the present time to talk to political prostitutes ; I wish rather to address myself to the Chair. This clause does not appeal to me as proposing to give every young man of 21 years of age a salary of Â£110. If the proposal were to give such a salary to officers who have been some time in the service and are more than 21 years of age I should be inclined to agree with it. I do not consider it necessary that a man of 21, when engaged in the general division of the public service, should receive Â£110 a year. There must be thousands and thousands of such men - if we can speak of persons of that age as men - who would be very glad to receive a lower wage. </para>

                        <para>- When I was 21 years of age I was receiving less, and I daresay there are many honorable senators who were in the same position. Ninety per cent. of the men employed in ordinary avocations receive less. Although I am not in favour of cutting down fair wages, and never have been, I think this is an unnecessary piece of extravagance. One of the reasons for my objection to this clause is that, from my point of view, the Bill is unsatisfactory, because, so far as I can see, it contains no proper provision for remedying injustices as between State and State. Every honorable senator knows that there are considerable discrepancies in the wages being received by civil servants in the various States. Civil servants in one State receive lower salaries than men who are doing exactly the same work in the service of another State. That is an inequality that should be remedied. By remedying it I believe we shall do a much greater service to the working man than by proposing that a youth, on reaching the age of 21, shall receive Â£110 per annum. My sympathy for working men is not limited to those who have attained the age of 21. Without wishing to fix an arbitrary point at the present time, I think that if this clause provided that when men in the general division of the public service attain the age of 25 they shall receive Â£110 per annum it might have my sympathy. I have no sympathy with those who say that a boy who has just come out of his apprenticeship and attained the age of 21, should receive this salary. I know men 30 years of age in the Commonwealth who are working much harder than those in this division will have to do, but who are not receiving this salary. This is false, hypocritical sympathy. I am not here to obtain votes. I am here to do what I believe is fair. To penalize the Commonwealth to the extent of Â£50,000 a year in order that boys who have just completed their apprenticeship shall receiveÂ£l 1 0 a year, is a monstrous proposal, and I intend to vote against it. Assuming that we have so much money to spare, this Â£50,000 will be badly needed to remedy the present injustices under the Public Service Bill. If Tasmania, for instance, is to be treated with that fairness which she was promised when the Constitution was framed at least Â£50,000 will be required to remedy the injustices under which she now suffers. Similar injustices exist in Western Australia and Queensland I am sure, but possibly not in South Australia. In these three smaller States there are many injustices which ought to be rectified. I have risen at this stage to ask the Postmaster-General whether he does not consider it desirable that we should postpone this clause. Is it right that we should deal with a clause involving an expenditure of Â£50,000 a year in a small committee like this? I know that the Postmaster-General is opposed to this clause, because he has proposed an amendment which largely nullifies it. If he takes up that attitude in regard to a Bill which is in his care, should he not agree to postpone this clause ? There are many other clauses that we may consider if we have to fill up time, but this from a financial point of view is undoubtedly the most important clause in the Bill. Therefore I urge the Postmaster-General to consider the desirability of postponing its consideration. </para>

                        <para>- If we wish to economise, let us begin with some of those who get big salaries, and do very little work. It is mean economy to say that those who have attained the age of 21, and have been in the general division for three years, are not entitled to a Salary of Â£110. It is a degrading position for the Commonwealth to be in, if it cannot afford to pay a little over Â£2 a week to its employes. I am sure that it is not the will of the taxpayers that economy should begin with these men. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them have been there for more years even than that. If honorable senators will only take an opportunity of personally observing the work these females are doing they will come to the conclusion that the real test as to the salaries which are to be paid is not what are the prospects or the intentions of those doing the work, but the value of the work they perform. If the work is of the value of Â£2 per week, then whether it is done by a male or a female, Â£2 per week should be paid for it. That is the principle upon which I am prepared to support the clause as it comes to us from the other House. </para>

                        <para>- The regulations also provide for an examination. In the regulations which provide for an examination for officers in the clerical division, we can provide for an examination of officers in the general division. No reason can be shown why a corresponding provision should not be put in this clause. What I ask the committee to do is really to cure the result of what was perhaps rather hasty action on the part of another place. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know why we should make the civil service a paradise and neglect people outside, who certainly are not living in a paradise, and the great majority of whom never get Â£110 a year. If the honorable senator will only go amongst the primary producers who keep all the manufacturers going, and average their wages, he will find that they do not get anything like Â£110 a year. Why should we single out civil servants, who, as a rule, are performing very simple work - work that is so run after that thousands would be only too glad to take the positions at the lower salaries now paid ? We should pause, and wait for a year or two, before we increase the burdens, not on the Commonwealth, which will be provided with plenty of money to pay for any extravagance it likes to incur, but on the individual States. Before the Postal and Customs departments were taken over by the Commonwealth the different States made great increases in the salaries of the officers. It was done in Victoria and South Australia, because it was urged that the Commonwealth would have to pay the money. In South Australia there was a readjustment of the wages, and a great increase in salaries was made right throughout the service,, especially amongst the poorest paid officers. Now we are asked suddenly to increase the cost of these two services by Â£50,000 a year. I ask honorable senators to pause and consider whether, under the circumstances, we are justified in sanctioning that increase without much consideration. In every part of the Commonwealth the labour party are exceedingly anxious to vote for increased expenditure, practically in all directions. </para>

As a rule the labour party go for increased salaries in the lower grades, which is quite right, but so far as ordinary expenditure on public works is concerned, to my mind, they do- not show that due regard for consequences which they ought to- do. </para>

                        <para>- I do not object to that. What I object to is that the sole qualification for the salary should be that the officer is 21 years of age and has been three years in the service. I may say that in the State of Tasmania there are men who have been in the service for fifteen years, and are 35 years of age, while they are9 now getting no more than Â£150 a year. I am concerned in this Bill to remedy those evils, and not to make an arbitrary law giving a lad 21 years of age Â£110 a year, whether he is worth it or not. There is only one alternative. He must get Â£110 a year, or be dismissed. The amendment moved by the Postmaster General does not satisfy me. We are considering manual labour to a large extent, and I see no reason why we should ask a capable manual labourer to pass an examination, unless it should be a physical examination. There might be some sense in that. The amendment provides that the officer shall be capable of doing the work "of an office to which a salary of that amount is attached." What does that mean ? An "office" suggests something in the clerical division, and entirely outside the scope of the general division. I do not know what is intended, unless it is something which will prevent a man getting Â£110 a year. This amendment has been sprung upon us to-night, and seeing that this is a most important clause, we should have a further opportunity of considering it. Therefore, I am going to urge the Postmaster-General to postpone this clause - not because there is only a small committee, for - I feel that that is not a very good reason - but because this is perhaps the most important clause in the Bill, and should receive proper consideration. </para>

                        <para>- The same rule would apply. Why should not a man in the general division who becomes qualified to receive this salary by reason of his age and length of service, pass an examination showing his fitness for the class of work he is engaged in, just as a clerical officer is required to do? The amendment I have proposed is so eminently reasonable that honorable senators who oppose it can hardly have given it serious consideration. They must see that it does not strike at the principle in this clause. If it does, then the principle embodied in clause 21 is equally injured by the provision there. </para>

                    <para>- The Postmaster-General in saying that he is willing to allow the clause to be postponed must certainly consider that the attendance to-night is not as large as it should be when the committee has to deal with a clause of this kind. He can have no other reason, because we have been dealing with this amendment for the last three or four hours, and if a vote were taken at once, every honorable senator would know what he was voting for. What can we gain by postponing the matter? I fail to see why we should postpone it. Every honorable senator has made up his mind that no purpose can be served by providing for an educational, or some other test, to be passed by officers already in the general division. After a man has entered the clerical division, he is required to pass a test to show that he is qualified to be raised from one position to another. The general division, however, includes labouring men, whose work requires no high intellectual standard. The Postmaster-General asks what difference is there between a man who is twenty years eleven months and 29 days old, and one who is 21 years old. There is very little difference. But there is a fixed rule that a youth enters upon manhood on reaching the age of 21, and when he has served three years' apprenticeship in a department, and is 2 1 years of age, we think he should be worth 7s. a day. If he is not then we presume that the highly paid inspectors who are to be appointed will discover that fact and see that his services are dispensed with. The question of economy has been raised. What was the position taken up by the Postmaster-General in regard to the appointment of a commissioner at Â£1,500 a year, and six inspectors at Â£800 a year ? Did he not say that we should be justified in paying those high salaries, because the men would render services worth them ? Certainly he did ; and in the same way we assert that the manual labourer will give the equivalent of 7s. per day. </para>

                        <para>- I notice that those honorable senators who have addressed themselves to the amendment, have laid great stress upon the words "prescribed examination." They have represented that those words mean that an officer who is engaged in manual labour will be called upon to pass some examination which differs entirely from the work he has been accustomed to do. That is not the intention. The intention is that a man shall give some proof of his fitness for the work in which he is engaged. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the Postmaster-General in this exhibition of hedging to which we have been treated, has practically taken up the position that he is opposed to his own Bill. It seems to me that the Government wish to go back upon the special provision with which we are now dealing, but have not the courage to do so openly and honestly. The Postmaster-General seizes upon every" pretext for delay. If an honorable senator who is opposed to the clause suggests that it should be postponed, he falls in with the idea immediately. I fail to see why we should not come to a decision now in view of the fact that we have discussed the matter fully. If there is not a full attendance it is not our fault. Honorable senators have been returned to do the work of the country. They are paid to be here, and if any of them do not attend they should be prepared to take the consequences. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that . mere service of three years is a proof that he is capable of performing his duties. If we' raise the salary suddenly from Â£60' to Â£110 we have a right, as nearly every honorable senator has admitted, to get good service, but they say you must either get good service for that money or dispense with the man. If we are not to have any test, how are we to know that he is capable of doing good work? I am quite willing, as I said before, to strike out the words "prescribed examination" if they are a stumbling block, and to substitute other words which will have this effect, that before the officer receives a salary of Â£110 he must have given some proof of his fitness for the work in which he is engaged. I do not know exactly what the words would be, because it depends upon the class of work he is performing. Probably if he were an assistant line repairer he would get a certificate of fitness from the line repairer under whom he is working ; or if he were a letter sorter he would get a certificate of fitness from the person who is immediately above him in office. He should give some proof of his fitness for the particular work he is doing. </para>

                    <para>- I hold that it is not quite right. I cannot see why we should impose such a hardship upon a mere youth of 21 years who may not have developed all his powers even to do manual labour. I probably know more of the subject of physical culture than honorable senators in the labour corner, and if a man at 21 years of age has not reached the full development of his physical powers, we are going to allow the commissioner to say to him, " In my opinion I can get a better man, and you will have to go." Honorable senators will not carry this minimum wage proposition so long as I can prevent it. I have moved my amendment in order that there shall be some other reason for fixing a public servant's wage at Â£110 a year than that he is 21 years of age, and has been three years in the service. If this clause is allowed to remain in the Bill as it is, we shall be doing a distinct injustice by paying some men much more than they ought to be paid in comparison with others. There is not the slightest doubt that if every man in the general division who is 21 years of age, and has been three years in the service, is to get Â£110 a year, many civil servants will be treated with great partiality in comparison with others in this or some other division. As I have mentioned before, there is no schedule of wages for this division, and the most that is done is to say that officers of the division shall not get less than Â£110, and we do not differentiate. </para>

                    <para>- It makes no provision with regard to the wages to be paid to officers of the general division. It simply leaves it to the commissioner, acting upon the advice of his inspectors, to give certain men certain salaries. But in respect of this wage of Â£110 we are taking it out of the hands of the commissioner and his inspectors. </para>

                    <para>- My honorable friends of the labour party are doing me a great injustice. I do not waste time, and I have no desire to " stone-wall." It is perfectly certain that if my honorable friends of the labour party desire to rush these clauses through the committee, the end will be that they will be recommitted. I am going to move that clause 21 be recommitted, and I shall certainly move a similar motion in regard to clause 25 if it is passed now; I wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether the minimum of Â£110 per annum is to be paid to men, who as boys entered the Victorian service as telegraph messengers, who have grown grey in that particular branch of the service; and have married and reared families on Â£60 a year - men who would rather stick to a billet of that kind than commence life again outside the service. Are we to have men acting as telegraph messengers and receiving Â£2 2s. 6d. per week? I should like to know also whether the Postmaster-General can tell us what will be required in addition to the sum which the Treasurer has placed upon his Estimates in order to give under-paid servants of the Commonwealth the average salary which we expect all our officers to receive ? What expenditure will be necessary in order that those Commonwealth servants in Western Australia and Tasmania, who are receiving a salary less than that paid to officers doing the same work in other States, may be placed on an equal footing ? </para>
