I do not know whether he followed me when I said that it is not contended that the aliens who have come into Western Australia since the passing of the Act could have passed the test. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator said last night that it was applied to 36 of these men, and that only 20 of them passed. In all other cases the test was not applied, and clearly, therefore, the fault was one of administration. There is nothing to show that those who passed the test in Western Australia were undesirable immigrants. If we admit that there is good in this method of exclusion if it is properly administered, then the cure for any defects in the past is to correct the administration. I think I have a right to presume that in this matter the Government have the confidence of the people of Australia. The Parliament has only recently been elected, the Government have only recently taken office, and surely those who have at heart the exclusion of undesirable persons from the Commonwealth cannot say that the Government, up to the present time, have done anything to forfeit the confidence of the people of Australia. We know the representatives of the people have recently said, in another place, that they are not prepared to intrust the work of administration to another set of men. If honorable senators are not prepared to say that the administration of the law at the present time is " untrustworthy, the only question is as to whether the proposed method of exclusion will work if it is 'properly and fairly administered, as, I think, we have every reason to believe that it will be. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the meaning of the phrase is perfectly clear. If undesirable immigrants attempt to enter the Commonwealth we have a certain test which we can put to them - a series of tests, in fact. If they pass all these barriers, then we cannot exclude them ; but if they fail to get over them we can exclude them. I think we may take the testimony, perhaps unwillingly given by several honorable senators opposite, that these tests will be effective, because the fault which they have found with this measure is that it will bo too powerful in the direction of exclusion, and I think some of them have admitted that this Bill amounts to absolute prohibition. We are asked now why, instead of adopting the method adopted by three States that have already passed legislation of this kind, we do Rot strike out upon a new path, and go in for absolute prohibition. The answer to that surely is that, in adopting legislation already in force in three of the States, we know where we are, and we know to a certainty that if this measure now before the Senate passes this Chamber it will receive the Royal assent at once. </para>

There was no difficulty whatever in obtaining the Royal assent to these measures, and therefore, we may assume, with something nearly approaching certainty, that if this measure passes both Houses it will be assented to. If there is any doubt whatever about the matter, how much more doubtful is it that a measure will be assented to which contains the proposition which some honorable senators opposite have favoured. </para>

                        <para>- We shall talk about half-a-loaf when we cannot get the whole loaf. Those who are opposed altogether to legislation of this description are opposed to it for various reasons. I propose to indicate some of those reasons, in my own way. Some say there is no necessity for this legislation. Others say - for the view has been given expression to here, if not directly, then inferentially - that it would not be advisable to exclude the people of some of the Asiatic countries, first, on account of the tropical character of some of our territory, and secondly, because some of them are British subjects. </para>

                    <para>The only point upon which I desire to make a few observations now is with regard to the education test which the Bill proposes to apply. I feel that a great deal of what I wish to say has been anticipated by the statement of the Premier that he will insert certain words varying the form which those desiring to enter this country will be called upon to sign ; but it appears to me that the educational test, even with the alterations suggested, is hardly sufficient. </para>

                    <para>With these few facts before me I think I am entitled to view with some measure of apprehension the rather inadequate test submitted in the Bill, and I would ask the Premier if, without jeopardizing the ultimate success of the measure, he could see his way to accept an amendment providing a move stringent test, to accept it. He has told us that a similar Bill is working in Natal with some measure of satisfaction ; but I would remind him that it has been of too recent date to know how it is working or is likely to work out. I can quite understand that if a Bill of this character is passed to-day it will for the next few months have a tendency to check immigration ; but after the purpose of the Bill becomes understood, I think it is possible that steps will be taken by those "who desire to carry people from India to Nata! to find ways and means to evade the test which the Bill provides. </para>

                        <para>- We give them discretion, which may be exercised in the widest possible way, but, remember, it is a discretion which has to be exercised subject to the control of Parliament, of public opinion, and of the press. Remember that regulations will be issued under this Bill, and instructions will be issued to officers under it. Officers will be chosen to administer the Act, let us hope, not without some regard to their power of enforcing a test of this kind but the whole matter of administration will be under the direct control of Parliament, which can at any time come down upon the Ministry,. and if they neglect their duty, and do not administer this law in such a way as to carry out the wishes of Australia, Parliament will soon find a means of saying so. </para>

Authority for such an act must te obtained from head quarters, and a power of that kind could not be exercised without most serious consideration by the Prime Minister, and probably after consultation with his Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>- It has been exercised and may be exercised at any time. We always hope that it will be exercised if the necessity for it arises, but I say the power is of such a serious nature that it would not be exercised without a great deal of consideration and care, and that it is not a power applicable to every-day use. What we .want is a power applicable to every-day use, a power which may be applied at any time, and within a few hours' notice when it becomes necessary, and the only way in which we can provide for that is by giving such a power under an Act of Parliament to officers appointed for the purpose of carrying it out. What I desire to ask my honorable friends opposite, who have such an earnest interest in this measure, is this : If they get all they want - and they cannot want more than prohibition - if they get all they want by the educational test which we propose, is there any use whatever in encumbering the Bill with this declaration, which must raise difficulties, and delay the passage of the measure, even if it is afterwards assented to ? </para>

                        <para>- No, certainly not. If this Bill were passed it would entirely over-ride all other legislation, and would be administered in priority to other legislation. A labourer who might be entitled to admission under the Western Australian Act, would nevertheless be refused admission by a Commonwealth officer J who could say to him - " If you cannot pass this test, we will not admit you, and we do not care about your rights under the Western Australian law." In the case of a conflict of legislation, the Commonwealth Act must prevail. The only question is as to the form in which we should refer to the other legislation. In the Post and Telegraph Act we have provided that certain local Acts " shall cease to apply to the Postal and Telegraphic services of the Commonwealth." There is no doubt that in its present form the clause would not de, and the only question is whether it would be better to leave it out altogether, or to put in some form of words which will follow the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>. - This matter has been brought up in connexion with several Bills since this Parliament was opened. In each case it has been decided, I believe, that some such clause as this should be inserted to indicate that the measure we are passing will override certain provisions of the State Acts. Even though that is provided for in the Constitution, it has been thought desirable to insert such a clause. I quite admit that if we stated in the Bill that we were repealing the State Act, and the Constitution did not cause it to be repealed, that provision of the Bill would have no effect ; on the other hand, if we went out of our way to say that a Bill we passed did not repeal a local Act, and if the Commonwealth Act and the local Act were repugnant, the local Act would be repealed. In a series of Bills relating to Customs we inserted such a provision. For instance, in the Distillation Bill, the provision was in the following form : - </para>

                <para>This Act shall apply to the distillation of spirits on which any duty of excise is imposed by the Parliament, and to the exclusion after the imposition of such excise of the operation of all State Acts relating to distillation. </para>

                <para>Senater GLASSEY. - The Customs officers will have to move the police to perform their office in order that they may be able to discharge their own duty.

I think the State would be glad to get rid of a matter of this kind. </para>

                        <para>- Unless we do so ^ the great bulk of these people are likely to remain here. That is what we desire to avoid. It would be a most serious matter if between the States on the one hand, and the Commonwealth on the other, it was thought to be nobody's business to see that the law in regard to deportation was carried out. The Commonwealth would deal more effectively with a matter of this kind than the State, not because the State is likely to shirk its responsibility, but because the Commonwealth has taken over the whole question of immigration. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that a Chinaman could not be admitted under the State Act, because the moment there was a conflict between the State and the Commonwealth law, the Custom-house officer, if he knew his duty, would point to the Commonwealth Act and say, " This is the only door by which you may enter ; if you cannot comply with the conditions of this Act you cannot come in." If in some of our Acts we have attempted to repeal State Acts or to put in certain words of limitation, just as we have done in the Postal Bill, we ought to go on in this measure and deal with the repeal of Acts. We should say that every law of every State which deals with the admission of immigrants into the State shall be null and void. </para>
