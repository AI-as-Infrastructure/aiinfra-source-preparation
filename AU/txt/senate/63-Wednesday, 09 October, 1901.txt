                        <para>- For instance, are Chinese to be at liberty to come into Victoria from New South Wales without let or hindrance?My reason for asking the question is,that at the time of the elections for the Federal Convention, I was waited upon by a deputation of Chinese who I wished to know whether after federation was accomplished any Chinaman who came into Australia at one port would be at liberty to travel all over the Commonwealth. I see that some correspondence has appeared in the newspapers on the subject, and it seems to me that this is a good opportunity for asking for an explanation from the Government in regard to it. </para>

                    <para>. - I have seen in the newspapers the suggestion that under one section of the Constitution immediately on the imposition of uniform duties by collection under the Tariff just announced there is absolute freedom for Chinese and other coloured aliens to pass from one end of Australia to the other. That contention appears to my mind to be absolutely ludicrous. There is no ground whatever for it. On the contrary, my opinion - and it is also the opinion of" my colleagues - is clearly this : that the State Acts now existing with regard to alien immigration remain in force until the Commonwealth displaces them by legislation covering the same field. </para>

                    <para>- As this matter has been brought up I desire to say that I also am pleased with the course the Government have adopted - a course which I fancy I was the only member of this Senate to suggest, though I never consulted a member of the Government about it. Contentions have been raised as to the legality of the procedure that has been followed by the Government. I always thought that the whole position, although unconstitutional, was constitutionally unconstitutional, and had become so recognised by long usage as to be as much a part of our law as if it were written in our statute-book. </para>

                    <para>- I only rise to call attention to a small point which, if neglected, may perhaps derogate from that absolute Inter-State free-trade which our Constitution gives us. I understand that it has been brought under the notice of the Government, and that no notice has been taken of it. I feel it to be necessary on behalf of the producer of Tasmania to mention the matter, as, unless attention is given to it, that freedom of trade which we have a right to expect under the Constitution, will not be effected. I am referring to the question of the wharfage rates which are now charged in Victoria and in other States of the Commonwealth. If Melbourne charges no wharfage whatever upon potatoes coming from Warrnambool, and 6d. or ls. a ton upon those coming from the NorthWest Coast of Tasmania, there is a slight restriction upon the free interchange of goods. The people of Tasmania will, I am quite sure, think that they have no right to be taxed ls. a ton wharfage on their potatoes if the potatoes from, any other port of Victoria are charged nothing. All the States are now one under the Commonwealth, and I hope we shall always remain one and indissoluble. I therefore hope that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will see to this point, and arrange in some way that wharfage charges shall not be an exception to Inter-State free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- I thought Standing Order, number 385, was not excepted. These standing orders were accepted hurriedly - but without any intention of curtailing any constitutional rights that we possess - at a time when we wanted to get something certain to work upon, and with a view of adapting them to our needs, so far as we could. Although we used the words, " so far as are not inconsistent with this Constitution," we did not mean to go so far. We meant to say - " So far as the same are applicable to our Constitution." And we meant no more. We showed that on the first occasion that the question whether the Chairman of Committees was to have a deliberative or casting vote came up, for we did not decide the matter at all. We ignored the standing order ; we said it was not applicable to the Senate, as compared with the House of Assembly, and we went on as a matter of course, without passing any resolution about it. The chairman has exercised his deliberative vote, as a matter of course. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, we did not mean to tie ourselves hand and foot under the standing orders. We were working under a new machine, to which numbers of the standing orders were inapplicable, and honorable senators did not dream for a moment that they were adopting anything else than standing orders that were suitable to the altered conditions of the Senate compared with those of the South Australian House of Assembly. We meant to go no further, and on the first occasion that we considered the matter the chairman said - " I propose to exercise a deliberative vote." That was assented to, although entirely against the standing orders. </para>

                            <para>- When we were considering the South Australia Standing Orders, we considered them in reference to the Constitution to which they are applied. Anything in them which would have the effect of negativing the right of any honorable senator to vote on any occasion on which he may exercise his legislative functions is essentially an attack on the Constitution, and an invasion of our rights. This is a question that concerns our rights and privileges equally, and it should be considered quite apart from feeling or prejudice, lt is a question of absolute constitutional right. In the Standing Orders Committee, of which I was a member, and of which the President was chairman, the chairman always exercised a deliberative, and never a casting vote. Not that that can prove anything. I only mention it- </para>

                            <para>- Never. Perhaps my honorable friend will allow me to deal with that point now. The first time that the chairman suggested that he had a deliberative vote was on or about the10thSeptember, when my honorable and learned friend proposed a motion which would have resulted in a report being brought up, with reasons. On the 13th August we had this very question discussed. </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I purposely discussed this question simply from the point of view of whether or not I was or was- not entitled to a deliberative vote, and I purposely avoided all reference to everything that has taken place in the committee. There is a report of the committee before the Senate, but my honorable and learned friend is going into something which is not before the Senate. </para>

I am accepting the view which our respected chairman puts when he says that it may be the duty of a committee to disagree. While accepting that view absolutely, I am pointing out that the effect of the motion would be that, in the very act of bringing ourselves into daylight once more, we should expire for all useful purposes. </para>

                            <para>- I tell the honorable and learned senator that I should like to win, but simply for the reason that I believe the view I take is right. I believe that this standing order governs the case, is decisive of it, and is not inconsistent in any respect with our Constitution. First of all, Standing Order No. 354 provides that the chairman of a select committee shall only have a casting vote. That was adopted on the report of the special committee chosen for the purpose of recommending to us a form of standing orders, in which they excepted standing orders that were contrary to the Constitution, and one in particular, Standing Order No. 214, to which I call the special attention of honorable senators. It provided - </para>

                    <para>Of course a standing order which said that the Speaker, and by analogy the President, should not have a vote, but should only have a casting vote, was wholly contradictory, of the Constitution, and the committee who recommended the adoption of these standing orders excepted Standing Order 214, giving the reasons " because it would give the President a casting, and not a deliberative vote, and it is contrary to the Constitution." </para>

Canada has an imperfect so-called Federal Constitution. It is not really federal at all, because they have no equal representation in the Senate. The Senate as constituted is a kind of House of Lords. The members are nominated for life, and they have accepted the analogy with the House of Lords, and follow the House of Lords' practice. </para>

Supposing it were a committee for the purpose of inquiring into an abstruse legal Bill, surely some honorable senators, my honorable and learned friend included, would be very suitably placed upon that committee, and why should the personnel of that committee be determined merely by the fact that there are six States in the Commonwealth ? </para>

That suggestion might be all very well if we were dealing with the repeal of these standing orders, but it is as we lawyers say, when talking to a jury, a suggestion of prejudice, and it is inapplicable when we come to deal with the interpretation of the standing orders which we have got, and which depends not upon the question of how he shall vote, but upon, the question of what is the nature of the vote that the chairman has got. We have six instead of seven members. If there were seven the chairman would have no vote unless there was an equal division. </para>

That settles the question so far as regards the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole; but is there anything in the Constitution which gives the same right to the chairman of a select committee ? Is there one word showing that a select committee must consist of one representative from each State, and that it must be founded on the same rule as to representation of the States as the Senate is? </para>

                            <para>- The Chairman of Committees is not deprived of it, because the standing order gives it to him. Is Standing Order 354 inconsistent with the Constitution ? Even if we have done wrong - and I think we are right - the standing order clearly gives the Chairman of Committees a vote, because it says that questions are to be decided in the same way as in the Senate itself. So in cases of select committees. In the Senate we vote by States, or according to equality of representation of the States, on matters which affect the States. Then again, as I have said, it is distinctly a matter to be dealt with by standing orders. If the Senate chooses to give, as it has chosen to give, a casting vote only to the chairman of a select committee, we must be governed by it. If the Senate chooses to alter that standing order, when it comes to settle the permanent standing orders for the guidance of the Senate, it may do so. </para>

                            <para>- But a wrong standing order might be altered to convert a minority into a majority. Is that a wise suggestion to make on an occasion like this? So long as there are seven members or a less number, and so long as our select committees are founded, as they must be, not upon equal representation of the States, but on the basis of the selection of the men who are supposed to be most familiar with the particular subject delegated to it - whether it be small pox or any other question - there is not the slightest reason why we should depart from the House of Commons practice. That practice is that the chairman has a casting vote, and not a deliberative vote. We are not, however, driven to the House of Commons. We have our own standing order, which is absolutely clear. The committee has existed all these months under this and other standing orders applicable to its procedure, without the slightest hint or question of their inapplicability. If we are to deal with this matter upon a large constitutional basis, and if we are to say this standing order of our Senate amounts to nothing, then we turn to section 48 of the Constitution Act, which provides that - </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to do anything of that kind. Therefore I will not go into details. A reference has been made, as it has been made in several quarters, to the committee being a committee of six. I do not wish to make any suggestion, either as regards the raising of this question in that connexion or in regard to the contention that might be made on the other side. I entirely approved of the constitution of the committee for the reason that I believed it would save a great deal of time, and for other reasons which I recollect were then stated here. It was an awkward position, and so far as it affected members of the committee the stronger side, speaking of it numerically, was losing one of its members, and so had to take the responsibility of continuing the business of the committee with a reduced number. Of course the difficulty as to the equal division of opinion, and the dead-lock could not have arisen but for the fact that there are only five members and a chairman. The claim to exercise and the exercise of this vote have rendered it necessary that we should have a final direction from the Senate, not as to whether we should repeal the standing order, but as to whether the chairman has a right, under Standing Order 354, taken in connexion with the Constitution and with all the other standing orders, to the deliberative vote which brings about this unfortunate and deplorable position of affairs. I shall be glad to see any way out of it. I should willingly have withdrawn my own vote if it would have brought about a report which could have come before the Senate to be dealt with, but to have done so would have prevented anything of the kind from happening. Therefore we are left in that serious and difficult position to which allusion has been made on both sides, and the first step at any rate to its solution is the determination of the point by the Senate. That the question may be clearly and distinctly raised, it is necessary that an amendment shall be moved. I move - </para>

I was only referring to that argument for the purpose of showing that the remedy is not to do something that is against the constitution, but to appoint another member to the committee, and it is perfectly open to the Senate now if it thinks fit to rescind the resolution, which was come to at a time when I must admit I had not the least idea that any such position as this would arise, and I do not suppose anyone else had. </para>

                            <para>- There is no difference as to the members, but there is a great deal of difference if we apply the narrow interpretation, when it means the Senate with the President in the chair. But if we employ the broad interpretation, it applies equally to committees of the whole. It will be remembered that when the section was previously raised a question had arisen in committee and was reported to the Senate, whereupon the President ruled that the Chairman was right. It was held by the President that, whether the vote exercised by the Chairman was called a casting vote or a deliberative vote, he had a vote, and certainly should not be deprived of it. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear the honorable senator say that, because I hope I shall be able, with unanswerable: force, to point out that exactly the same principle ought to drive honorable senators to the conclusion that the same rule should apply to select committees. In addition to that I would direct attention to another precedent, not of the same kind, but which I think is worthy of consideration. The Standing Orders Committee have met on many occasions and have done very important work. </para>

What we are engaged upon is the question of the interpretation of this standing order, and whether it is of is not inconsistent with the Constitution. That another committee has adopted a different interpretation of it cannot affect the judgment of the Senate at all. A decision of the Senate is a precedent for the Senate, but a decision of a select committee is not. </para>

                        <para>Questions are determined in select committees by the voices and by divisions in the same manner as in the House to which they belong. In the Lords Committees the chairman votes like any other Peer, and if the numbers on a division are equal, the question is negatived. In the Commons the practice is similar to what takes place in the House on divisions, the chairman voting only when the numbers are equal, and then giving the easting vote. </para>

                            <para>- It would leave us in the same position. On the particular occasion in question, it might have prevented the difficulty, but it does not get rid of it. It is a mere ostrich-like method of procedure. Assuming that we had seven members on the committee, and the question came up, then it might be said at once " it does not matter whether you call it a casting vote or a deliberative vote." It would make all the difference, however, if one member of the committee were absent. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. There might be only six members present and thus the difficulty would still remain. By appointing a seventh member we do not get over it. The point we have to consider is whether the standing order is a valid one, and whether it proposes to give the chairman of a select committee a deliberative or casting vote. If we appointed one or 100 members the difficulty would still exist and might crop up at any time that an equal division of votes took place. I do not know whether the argument was put forward seriously or not, but I trust that the Senate will not agree with the view that that proposal would be a solution of the difficulty. </para>

Does not every honorable senator see that a position of that kind induces clever juggling; that as a matter of fact it would bring about a state of things in which the parties, being equally divided, would never move anything? Would not that be the inevitable result of having a committee of six, every member of which possessed a deliberative vote? </para>

                            <para>- I confess I am not able to agree with the honorable and learned senator in his reading of it. I think the honorable and learned senator's reading is too limited, and my conviction is that in a select committee of the Senate every man has an absolute right to a deliberative vote, and if my view be correct, no standing order can possibly override the Constitution. A great deal has been said on the subject of giving equal representative power to the States in each committee, but that, I think, has nothing whatever to do with this matter. </para>

                        <para>- After the long debate which has taken place this afternoon, the Senate will have some sympathy with members of the committee. The whole House has been engaged for nearly four hours in considering this matter, and as similar debates take place on the occasion of the meetings of the committee which, as a rule, do not extend over a period of more than two hours, honorable senators will be able to form some idea of the great progress we are making. It seems to me to be a most extraordinary state of affairs, that the gentleman whom we honour by electing as the chairman of our committee, should have less power in dealing with the business of the committee than that possessed by any other member of it. </para>

That is a Very good precedent for us to follow in this case. I have heard on good authority that we are not a select committee at all.

                            <para>- The Government clearly contemplated that the chairmen of all our select committees should have only a casting vote. That was the Government proposal then ; but in this particular case it is exactly the opposite. However, it was not to discuss legal questions that I rose. What I want to speak about strongly is the great injustice which has been and is being done to Western Australia by this protracted discussion as to the qualifications of one of its representatives. </para>

                            <para>- I am only speaking of what might happen. If this motion is carried it will mean that there will be six members on the committee, each of whom will have a deliberative vote. As there is a dead-lock at present, that will be .accentuated by the fact that if one member proposes a motion the others can negative it. The result will be that because of these dissentions in the committee Western Australia will continue in her present invidious position, and will not have the representation to which the Constitution entitles her. I am going to vote against the motion, simply because I believe it will perpetuate the present difficulty. </para>

                            <para>- That is an imputation which the honorable and learned senator should not have made. I am not actuated by the fact that I sit on the Opposition side. If the honorable and learned senator cares to look at the whole of my votes throughout this Parliament, he will see that I have voted as often with the Government as with the Opposition. I am not actuated b)7 party spirit in these matters, but I take the view which I think is the correct one. The point upon which I feel strongly is that as long as these bickerings continue. Western Australia will not have her full voting power. There are many important questions coming on, such as the Alien Immigration Restriction Bill, the Tariff, and other proposals. </para>

                        <para>But the first question is - What does section 23 of the Constitution mean ? It says - " Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority of votes, and each senator shall have one vote. The President shall, in all cases, be entitled to a vote, and when the votes are equal the question shall puss in the negative." Does that apply to every committee appointed by the Senate? If it applies to a committee of the whole, it -.rill also apply to a select committee ; because a committee of the whole is in no different position to a select committee. It is a committee appointed by the Senate. </para>

Then my honorable friend says Western Australia would have had a member. It might or it might not, but that is scarcely the question which was before us. It was a great principle, which, speaking generally, has been argued fairly and reasonably, and without the introduction of side issues, such as Senators Smith and Fraser introduced, which, in my opinion, have nothing to do with the question. </para>

                    <para>. - When we sent this Bill to the House of Representatives, it contained a provision in clause 19 that the alteration of rates should be by means of regulations laid upon the table of both Houses of Parliament. The House of Representatives have struck out that clause, and have altered another clause so as to provide that an alteration of rates must be made by Act of Parliament. We discussed the subject on a previous clause, and there was a general agreement amongst honorable senators that we should consent to the alteration made by the House of Representatives.

                        <para>- The House of Representatives have inserted new clauses 25a and 25b. The object of these two clauses is to make provision for the payment of postage, not by the person posting the postal matter, but by a State. Some States have adopted the principle of voting by post, and they desire that the voter who intends to vote by post should be allowed to put his ballot-paper into the letter-box without affixing a postage stamp to it, and that the paper should be delivered to the electoral officer. "We do not want to prevent any State from carrying out an Electoral Act of this description, if it desires to do so. The two clauses in question have been very carefully prepared by the Parliamentary Draftsman. </para>

                        <para>- The States are going to pay for the service. The only difference is that, instead of the person posting the letter putting stamps upon it, it will be carried to its destination, and the officer who receives it will pay, or the postage will be debited to the State affected. That is to say, we put the State in this position - that if it likes to carry postal matter free it may do so, so far as concerns the individual who posts the matter, but the Federal Post-office will require to be paid all the same.

                        <para>- This is the newspaper definition clause to which the committee devoted a great deal of attention when the Bill was being dealt with here. I propose to say a word or two about the clause generally, and then I propose to move that the amendment of the House of Representatives be accepted. Several amendments were made in another place, and eventually the clause was withdrawn, and another one was provided so as to embody the different amendments. It will be remembered that when the Bill was first introduced the newspaper definition restricted a newspaper to a publication which was issued at intervals of not more than seven days. An amendment was moved in the Senate to strike out seven days, and substitute 30. That was the period which had been accepted in all the different States up to that time. The effect of that amendment was to let in under the definition of " newspaper " a whole lot of monthly publications of various kinds. Since the Bill has been before the House of Representatives, various amendments have been made in it, all of which have been in the direction of opening the door wider and wider. I strongly protested, when the Bill was being dealt with by the Senate, against the alteration which was made having the effect of letting in all these monthly periodicals. As I have just said, the amendments since made in another place have been in the direction of opening the door wider, and of allowing a very great deal of printed matter to come in at the lower rate, which matter, under the old definition, would have had to go through the post as printed matter, and not as newspaper matter. The effect will be that the Postal department will have to carry as newspapers a vast amount of postal matter which previously went through the post as printed matter and paid a higher rate. I do not see, unless we are going to retrace our steps altogether and get back to the point we started from, that we can reject the amendments made by the House of Representatives. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is generally admitted that there should be a reasonable charge for newspapers. I have endeavoured usually not to forecast what is coming on, but it is a generally accepted proposition that there must be some charge, at all events. I do not desire that there shall be any unnecessary delay in dealing with this Bill. It must be borne in mind that the second reading of the measure was moved on the 6th June. It is now October, and I am very anxious that we should get the measure into operation by the 1st December, for the reason that it is very desirable that we should get our Rating Bill passed before the end of the year, and that the regulations should be framed and laid upon the table of Parliament. I hope to have the regulations ready to lay upon the table as soon as this measure becomes law. </para>

That provision was inserted in the House of Representatives, and the object of it is, I believe, to insure that in the first place the work will be done within the Commonwealth, and in the second place it has the effect that the letterpress is more likely to be Australian in character if it is produced here than if produced in some other country.

                        <para>- I am sure that the "honorable and learned senator recognises what the clause is aimed at. It is aimed at the circulation by our postal service of supplements which are set up in type and ,printed in other parts of the world. Those «of us who come specially in contact with the industrial classes know that the linotype machine in the printing trade has done havoc enough in the ranks of the compositors. No less than 55 men out of 70 have been displaced in some offices by the introduction of the linotye, and we know that in Australia at the present time the ranks of compositors are overcrowded. When we propose to give newspaper proprietors special concessions, as provided ain this Bill, we have a right to ask that -.they shall not introduce, in competition with Australian printers, supplements prepared and set up by the cheap labour of Other parts of the world. </para>

                        <para>- I may tell the honorable and learned senator that printed matter now comes into the. Commonwealth from Japan, set up by men who are paid about one-eighth of the wages paid to Australian compositors and printers generally. If one effect of the provision is of a protective character, we cannot help that. We are desirous of giving newspaper proprietors certain concessions, but we say that Australian compositors and, printers generally shall not be brought into unfair competition with people outside. I am sure honorable senators do not wish to give concessions to printers outside the Commonwealth to compete with their own citizens, who furnish the taxes to carry on the Federal Parliament and the Federal services generally. </para>

                        <para>- If it is impossible to make that alteration, I wish to say a few words on paragraph (6) of subclause (2). From the educational point of view, supplements are undoubtedly the best portion of country newspapers. Generally country newspapers consist of advertisements and local news of the day. A supplement usually consists of educational matter culled from various journals. I have enjoyed reading the supplements far more than the papers themselves. Australian compositors, of course, can set them up ; but a country newspaper does not happen to receive all the publications in the world. The proprietors do not go to the expense, nor are publishers philanthropic enough to send their newspapers to every one in the black blocks. The proprietors of country newspapers, therefore, have not an opportunity to get this information from the various newspapers ; but a central agency can cull from such newspapers interesting facts which are of value to the people, and publish them in supplements for issue in country newspapers. It would certainly be. a great hardship, not to the people of the metropolis, but to people of inland, places, to disallow the circulation of such supplements by post. I can understand the prohibition of the transmission of any publication which is obscene or blasphemous, or which is against the interests of the people, but we are asked to prohibit the transmission of something which we admit is absolutely harmless. </para>

                        <para>- -The great newspapers, owned by wealthy men, bring in the linotypes, which throw men out of work. Although the general policy of the Government is protection, they admit linotypes free, not to benefit the little country newspapers, which are struggling to carry on, and which play a very important part, but to benefit newspaper proprietors who, perhaps, comprise some of the wealthiest men in Australia. And they further accentuate the difference by saying that little country newspapers shall not even have the right ti send a supplement by post. I sincerely hope that the committee will see its way to strike out the clause. </para>

                        <para>- I do not admit that at all. It is admitted that we are giving some concessions to newspapers, and if we make this stipulation that the newspapers shall be printed and published within the Commonwealth, why should we not say that the supplements, which we are willing to accept as part of the newspaper, shall also be printed and published within the Commonwealth? The practice has been to import the matrix from abroad and from that to make stereo plates, and to print the supplement in a local office. The disadvantage of that-and I place this almost before the question of the employment of labour within the Commonwealth - is that is does not encourage Australian literature. If you get your supplements printed abroad, or import the matrix from which to print supplements, the strong probability is that the matter which you will get will appertain to the country where it is printed, and not to Australia. That is undesirable. It is better to cultivate a taste for Australian literature and an Australian sentiment. </para>

                        <para>- It has been thought, even by the mother State, that it would be advantageous in some respects to carry newspapers free. I maintain that the proposed new clause will prevent a good number of small country newspapers from spreading literature amongst persons living in the outside townships. Therefore, seeing that the clause has no proper place in a Bill of this sort, I shall vote against it. It is clear that the clause is intended for protective purposes. If so, let the matter be dealt with in the Tariff, which is the proper place for it. </para>

                    <para>- A peculiar doctrine has been propounded by the last speaker - that unless supplements are printed abroad they are not likely to increase the circulation of country newspapers. It has been alleged by other honorable senators that better supplements can be obtained abroad than from within the Commonwealth, and that country newspapers are likely to cease to interest many of their subscribers if locally produced supplements are used by them. I cannot subscribe to that doctrine, nor do I believe that everything from abroad is superior to what can be produced in the Commonwealth. I read a little of the current literature that comes from other parts of the world, from America and elsewhere. </para>

                        <para>- That is a different matter altogether. What earthly reason is there why in a city like Sydney, with its cosmopolitan ideas, where there are men of capacity and learning, who are well up in literature, supplements of the most attractive character should not be produced ? I fully believe that supplements can be produced in Sydney and Melbourne that are quite as good as those produced in London or New York. Even though this clause is of a protective character surely there can be no harm done by means of it. If we can in any way provide by means of a Bill of this sort that work that is required shall be done within the Commonwealth, we ought to encourage those who do that class of work. Indeed, it is our bounden duty to do so. The proposed new clause is a reasonable one, and I hope the committee will adopt it. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is not afraid to give a monopoly in other instances to persons in London or New York, though he is terribly afraid of giving a monopoly to a few newspapers. I shall vote for the proposed new clause, because I believe it will have the effect of giving encouragement to Australian workmen and literary men, and even to Australian capitalists. </para>

                        <para>- I am pointing out that by proposing to admit illustrations, the supporters of this amendment admit that there ave certain things which the producers of this work in the States are not yet prepared to supply. That being the case, what is the good of saying with one breath that it is desirable to admit engravings, and then saying with the next breath - " We will only admit them under conditions which amount to prohibition?" </para>

                    <para>- I do not think there is so much in this question as one would be led to believe from some of the remarks that have been made. One would think from some speeches, that the whole question of fiscalism is raised upon the proposed new clause. There is a right way and a wrong way of dealing with these matters, and I do not believe that we should make a Postal Bill the medium for protecting a local industry. I have seen many of these country newspaper supplements, and I may say that the greater part of the' attractiveness of some country newspapers lies in the supplement. People can get the news from the metropolitan newspapers, bub they buy the local papers because they contain more local news, together with perhaps an attractive serial story, some scientific and general literary matter, and other items of interest. </para>

                        <para>- Some of them are printed outside the Commonwealth, and some of them are printed inside, but if they are to' be compelled to be. printed within the Commonwealth, let there be a heavy duty imposed ab the Customs-house. A Postal Bill ought simply bo provide the vehicle for the transmission of these papers, and I fail to see why we should make it the medium for taxing supplements that are not printed within the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- I fail to see that the question that is raised in the new clause, inserted by the House of Representatives, has anything bo do with the fiscal policy. We have already decided "for the purpose of this measure," that a newspaper shall mean a newspaper printed and published within the Commonwealth. In framing such postal legislation we are simply defining what particular publications will get the benefit of the reduced rates as newspapers. Under ordinary circumstances, unless there was some special exemption, a newspaper would have to pay at ordinary packet rates. It is here proposed that papers printed and published within the Commonwealth shall be carried at lower rates of postage as contrasted with other postal articles. I think that if we decide that a newspaper is to be defined as a publication printed and published within the Commonwealth, we ought also bo regard the supplement " for the purpose of this measure," as something printed and published within the Commonwealth also if it is to get the advantage of the low rate of postage. It is not a question of excluding publications from beyond the Commonwealth, but of simply saying that only those printed and published within the Commonwealth shall get the special advantages of newspaper rates. I have known of this absurd anomaly, that a lithograph has been issued by a paper published in a metropolitan district in Australia, during the height of the war, illustrating the return of an Australian trooper to his home and family from the Boer war, and I have seen at the bottom of the lithograph the words - "Engraved and lithographed in Holland." I have it on the best of authorities, and a number of them, that lithographs of equal merit could have been produced within another centre about 100 miles from the place from which this supplement was issued. The Senate decided that in order to get the benefit of the lower rates of postage a newspaper should be printed and published in the Commonwealth. It is how proposed that newspaper supplements, in order to be included in the same concessions, should also be printed within the Commonwealth, and I shall, therefore, vote for the amendment as it stands. </para>
