                            I can assure you, sir and honors able members, that I rise to speak to this subject with a great deal of trepidation, as this is the first time I have ever had the honour to occupy so proud a position in such an august Chamber as this is. I hope it will not bo the last time. At an early stage by way of interjection, which is the only means available to an honorable member unless he is addressing the Chair, I objected to the procedure that has been adopted in the conduct of the debate. You, sir, will remember that I interjected that I thought it would be better, and I still think it would be better, that when an amendment was moved to the Address in Reply every senator should bc strictly confined to the terms of the amendment, and then when that question was disposed of the main question could be discussed in a proper manner. In the way in which this debate has gone on,, the amendment has been lost sight of to a very large extent, the whole ground has been travelled over, and everything has been intermixed and is higgledy piggledly. I do not think that is conducive to a proper understanding between senators or to tho good conduct of public business, and I hope that there will be a standing order to the effect that every amendment shall be dealt with on its merits and the main question debated afterwards on its merits.

                            <para>- Yes; and by the spirit of fairness of the chairman, we shall succeed in adjusting our difficulties, I have- no doubt. I want to give the Senate some of my personal experiences; and I wish honorable members to thoroughly understand that Victoria is not all Australia, nor is Tasmania, or Western Australia, or Queensland, or any other State - that the local conditions have to be taken into consideration. As an old miner, I may say that we had a bitter experience of a protective Tariff in trying to establish some foundries in the southern part of the State. This has acted most injuriously on the development of our gold-fields. I believe firmly that any attempt to tax the machinery necessary to the development of primary industries will injure all industries, including what might be otherwise known as secondary industries - that everything that is necessary to the development and enlargement of the primary industries should be absolutely free if not encouraged in other ways by a subsidy. Let me tell you that in Charters Towers, the premier gold-field of Australasia, mining has got to such a pitch there now that it is utterly impossible for the poor man to undertake mining operations on his own account. </para>

He has loafed on her, he has stolen what money he possibly could from her, he has promptly got drunk, come home, and shown his gratitude by beating her with his walking-stick. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; the greatest mixture that is to be found on the Australian continent. To give the Senate an idea of what opportunity a white man has of getting work at Port Darwin, I may say that while I was there tenders were called for the sinking of a well. Three of my mates and myself went to the office, where tenders were returnable, for the purpose of having a look at the specifications. Strange as it may seem, the manager was particularly frank and outspoken about the matter. He. said - "If you tender for the contract on a wage to which you have been used you will not get it. No one can get this contract unless he is prepared t6 employ Chinamen, or men who will work for the same wage as Chinamen." Singular to relate, - this frank and outspoken person was named "Solomon." In this great city of Melbourne there is a thoroughfare known as Little Bourke-street. I walked down that street the other day. </para>

                            <para>- I wanted to see something as to the extent of the alien trouble there, and I was told the best place to which to go in search of information was Little Bourke-street. I commandeered a policeman, and asked him to point me out the street. I must have walked down the street for something like three-quarters of a mile, and on either side there was an unbroken line of alien shops and businesses. It was painful to -see the number of young girls and boys flitting in and out of those shops. I thought to myself then, that the people of Victoria had better very calmly comb their hair before they started to point a finger at Queensland because of the aliens in her midst. Here in this city - the finest in the Commonwealth - in a main thoroughfare, they have thousands of them, and goodness knows what amount of disease and infamy is to be found in. Little Bourke-street. Victorians, as well as Queenslanders, have got to put their best foot foremost, and to give the Government every assistance in clearing out this curse from the Commonwealth and making Australia white. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. In Melbourne they carried it off in a spirit of fun. I saw the Chinese procession in Sydney, when the Bushmen's contingent was going away, and the fact that struck me as I watched those thousands of Chinamen was that they marched with the air of conquerors. If they had captured Australia and were having a triumphal procession they could not have worn a prouder look than they did that day. I thought to myself that the day might come when the Chinese would march as conquerors through Sydney, unless the white people woke up and protected themselves. I would like to direct the attention of honorable senators to the fact that the Commonwealth will very likely have a very difficult question to solve. One senator has said that we must be very careful in dealing with coloured aliens because of foreign complications. At the time the statement was made it did not attract much notice, but since then we have had information from Queensland which gives point to it. A Bill was passed by the Queensland Parliament last session, known as the Sugar Works Guarantee Bill, which provided for advances of money to sugar works. The Opposition succeeded in inserting a clause providing that no null that was subsidized by the Government should employ alien coloured labour. We see by the papers that the representative of the Crown has suspended judgment on the matter. He will not give the Royal assent to the passing of the Bill on that particular ground, because it may involve us in foreign complications. What does that mean ? It means that we are not permitted to deal with coloured aliens in our own way according to our own conditions and guided by our own experience, but that we are to be subjected to the opinions of those who know us not and who have other arrangements with these foreign powers. </para>

                            <para>- - I am not agreeing with it. I wish the honorable member would understand that there is a difference between kanakas and of coloured aliens generally. We have dozens of different kinds of alien labour. In South Australia, no doubt, I could find a Little Bourke-street somewhere. </para>

                            <para>- I hope the healthy influence of the labour party has succeeded in running them out. I have detained the House at greater length than I had intended, and I must say I am thankful to honorable senators for the good hearing they have given me. In conclusion, I would urge upon the Government that as soon as possible they should introduce their intended legislation regarding the exclusion of aliens. Whatever they do they should remember that while a determined effort has been made on the part of the Opposition to shove the fiscal question to the front, that is not the main issue at the present time. There are more urgent business matters to be considered and dealt with. The Government may easily allow the fiscal issue to stand over for the whole of this session. They would be strictly within their rights in doing so, and in devoting themselves to the securing a white Australia. That accomplished, they could start afresh next session on the fiscal issue. I have had some experience in dealing with a Customs Bill, and I can assure honorable senators that next to the vexed question of land settlement, a settlement of the Tariff' is the most obnoxious, and takes up the most time. I am certain that once we start to frame a Tariff we shall find ourselves involved in a task which must occupy a very long time. When it has been framed there will be hardly a Government which has any important business to do that will dare to re-open it for amendment, because once you start to amend a schedule to a Tariff Bill the whole session is gone. The whole of one session should be given to framing a Tariff Bill, and the Tariff should then be allowed to rest for a year or two. </para>

                            <para>- I simply wish, in all modesty, to say that I am not a naval or a military expert, but as a layman I am prepared to say this : that if it is urged that the Commonwealth should indulge in an expenditure amounting probably to ?5,000,000 for the purpose of defence, then there is a far better opportunity - and please excuse me for appearing parochial in this argument - for the expenditure not of that amount, but of some money, in the little island of Tasmania. One senator has talked about the defences of Australia. I noticed at the time he was speaking that he carefully omitted to say anything about Tasmania. I interjected, but he did not hear me. I do not like interjections, and so I did not press the matter. I think that to every layman - because our military experts at present are out of the chamber - this will appeal as something like common sense, that if we are ever to be threatened with an invasion it will come from a naval power. We have no frontiers to defend. Any attack which is going to be made upon us must be made by sea, and if it is going to be made by sea, as it must, then I submit that there could be no more excellent base for naval operations against the whole of Australia than Tasmania. At the present time, the ports of that State are absolutely defenceless. It is perfectly easy for a foe, if it wishes to attack the Commonwealth, to seize more than one magnificent harbor and to use them and Tasmania generally as a base for operations against the whole of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- It is perfectly true that they must pass Western Australia, and South Australia and Victoria if you like, but they will pass the whole lot of them by sea and not by land, and they are not likely to come within shot of the magnificent guns that are ranged all along that coast. I do not think that that in any way affects my argument, but I do say, that if the argument is good we . con safely indulge in a certain amount of expenditure, far less than the ?5,000,000 suggested for this railway, in defending Tasmania, whose ports are absolutely defenceless. </para>

                            <para>- Although my friend may laugh, that, at any rate, is my own opinion ; and, further it is my own desire. I prefer that this subject should be approached in that spirit and in no other. In one sense we are united in our desire to devise some financial scheme that shall materially assist this Commonwealth instead of doing it harm, and we recognise that out of that very difference may come a scheme that will be beneficial. With regard to protection, let me at once say what is my chief objection to it, and I hope I shall say nothing which will in any way hurt the feelings of those honorable members who sit opposite. I object to protection because it represents that kind of State interference which I think is foolish and misguided. Now, I recognise that the State may properly intervene in many ways that affect the social or physical interests of the individual. It may, and often has, properly legislated with regard to his health and his disease. It has taken steps to save him from disease, and to preserve his health, and it has interfered in very many social ways to his benefit. </para>

                            <para>- I will come to factory legislation presently. I say in many social ways the State can properly intervene with great benefit to the individual, but, in my humble opinion, when it comes to economic questions, when the State begins to interfere and attempts to tell a man how he shall buy, and how he shall sell, then I think it makes a great mistake. I object to State interference in that way. I grant that the State may properly interfere to prevent the individual suffering from either force or fraud; but I say that when it attempts to interfere with the individual's, legal rights of disposing of his own money it makes that mistake which, to my mind, is the chief objection to protection. Protection, whatever else it represents, does distinctly represent State interference. </para>

I admit that the State, in fact, can interfere for the benefit of the individual and the community, but I do deny, and I am afraid I shall never be convinced, that the State has any inherent right to interfere with the legal rights of individuals. </para>

I am speaking now about the production of articles that form the subject-matter of imports and exports, and I say, without any doubt whatever, that where wages are high you get economy of production. </para>

                            <para>- I am coming to that now. I am desirous therefore that the matter should be left with the States, because one or two States have already dealt with it, and almost every State Government has had it as one of the planks in its platform. The State Governments are in a position to raise money by direct taxation, and they can much more easily deal with the introduction of such a scheme. On the other hand the Federal Government cannot do so very satisfactorily. I was pleased therefore when I found that the Federal Ministry withdrew that matter from their policy. We all feel that those who have borne the heat and burden of the day, those who have helped to create the great wealth of this country, should not, when old age overtakes them be, left destitute. </para>

                    <para>When the policy of free-trade was adopted in this country it was not contemplated that customs duties should be given up as an important source of revenue ; on the contrary it was one of the chief arguments of the early advocates of the abolition of protection, that relieving the country from those duties which imposed a burden on the public without bringing in a corresponding amount of revenue, would tend to increase the amount received from the duties that were retained, it was held that the essential principle of the free-trade policy consisted in abstaining from all attempts to divert industry from its natural channels, and in imposing taxes solely for revenue in such a manner as to take as little money as possible beyond what was paid into the Treasury out of the pockets of the consumers.

                            <para>- The parliamentary reformer. In his article on the McKinley Tariff he pointed out that in Great Britain during the time she had protection the working classes of England were practically reduced to poverty and destitution. I quote this because I have heard it said that England did not adopt free-trade until she had thoroughly established her industries. Now, she had protection for over 200 years, but what was the condition of her trade at the time she adopted free-trade? Were her legislators convinced theoretically that free-trade would be the best ? No, they were forced by the logic of facts to abandon their protectionist principles. </para>

If she was a natural manufacturing country then in the days of protection she ought to have been prosperous, but the cry was that the mills were lying idle, and destitution reigned throughout the land. The people met at the cross roads to discuss their grievances, and one woman said - "They say we be protected, but if we be protected we are also starved." That was the condition of Great Britain after pursuing a protective policy for so many years. </para>

                        <para>I fairly avow to you that in making this great reduction upon the import of articles, the produce and manufacture of foreign countries, I have no guarantee to give you that other countries will immediately follow our example. I give you that advantage in the argument. Wearied with our long and unavailing efforts to enter into satisfactory commercial treaties with other nations, we have resolved at length to consult our own interests, and not to punish those other countries for the wrong they do us in continuing their high duties upon the importation of our products and manufactures by continuing high duties ourselves, encouraging unlawful trade. We have had no communication with any foreign Government upon the subject of these reductions. We cannot promise that France will immediately make a corresponding reduction in her Tariff. I cannot promise that Russia will prove her gratitude to us for our reduction of duty on her tallow by any diminution of her duties. </para>

                            <para>- The duties upon some of the raw material of the industry. What would be the effect if we adopted the principle of protection ? Who are we to protect ? Take for instance the iron trade. I, as an engineer, would probably desire to have a duty on my finished article. In South Australia they put a duty upon the product of the engineer, but they admit this raw material free. Why? Because it cannot be produced there. Protection has done us no good because we have not had a market in South Australia. Ninetyfive per cent. of our engineers' work is actually done for States and countries outside of our own borders. But, supposing the engineers fight for 25 per cent. now. What will Sandford, of Lithgow, claim -That he should have a duty on his finished article? He would say - " We have our iron beds, which are like mountains; we have the coal and brains, and we can manufacture pig iron and bar iron, and plates, and so forth, and we ask for a protective duty." That is why America finds herself handicapped when she has to compete in the markets of the world. What would be the effect here? When we sell the article at home we can put the cost of the raw material on to the consumer, but when we sell our articles in the markets of the world we find ourselves handicapped and unable to compete. Although a man may be a protectionist when living in a State which has barriers erected between it and other States, when those barriers are removed; I can understand that same man becoming practically a free-trader. The resources of this country are such that we can produce almost everything that we require, and if it is simply a question of how much duty we are to impose to establish factories, Parliament will determine that. I think any one who has studied the question will admit that it would not be in the interests of labour to adopt what is known as a protectionist policy. I belong to the secondary producing class. I know that my success depends entirely on the prosperity of the primary producer. If the primary producers are prosperous then our prosperity is assured, because they will require the work which we can supply. Who are the primary producers ? The miners, the agriculturists, the pastor a lists, the market gardeners - in fact, as has been freely stated by several honorable members, 95 per cent. of the people of the Commonwealth are outside the pale of protection. Is it just to ask 95 per cent. to burden themselves on behalf of 5 per cent. ? We are in the position that revenue must be raised, and, seeing that the people are not yet prepared to adopt a direct system of taxation, then the Custom house affords the best means at present by which to raise the necessary revenue. But surely we shall not, in-order to raise ?7,000,000, tax the people to the extent of ?10,000,000. Surely it becomes our interest and our duty to our constituents, if we have to raise such a large sum of money to carry on the Government of the country, to draw as little as possible out of the pockets of the tax-payer. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know ; but if you will look at the general condition of the working classes in England you will find that their condition has vastly improved, and wages in that country have risen enormously since the introduction of a free-trade policy. One may say that no country has prospered to the extent that Great Britain has since she adopted the policy of free-trade and commerce. </para>

                            <para>-Well, can my worthy friend quote any nation that has increased in prosperity to a similar extent. Take any country you like, arid look at its imports and exports. Look at the general trade, and then ask yourself what is there to justify any one in saying that England should be so prosperous under all circumstances. She was slower to adopt her educational system than Germany was. It is our protectionist friends who are always trying to find proof that Great Britain is not as prosperous as she really is. They are always seeking something to confirm their ideas that under free-trade no nation can be as prosperous as it would be under protection, and always seeking some little proof that England is losing her trade and commerce. And yet what do we find ? Not very long ago the Midland Railway sent to America for some locomotives. The cry then raised was - " America is swamping England now, England has to go to America for her locomotives." The amalgamated engineers wrote to England asking why locomotives had to be imported, and the reason was given by the superintendent of the Midland Railway Company. He said that they had the whole of their hands working night and day, and that they could not place an order with any private firm and have it executed in time to meet their requirements ; all private firms were so busy that they could not guarantee to deliver; and hence the company went to America to get locomotives, where they had them in stock, ' or could produce them much more quickly than they could be produced in England. If we take the letters that appeared in the papers showing what the labour leaders of Great Britain think as to protection and free-trade, we shall find that every one of them has said that under freetrade England has prospered enormously. The condition of her workers has improved to such an extent that you could not persuade them to support the adoption of a system of protection. </para>

                            <para>- I am aware of that. I am speaking of what Victoria has done. We are all aiming at increasing our exports . What are our exports to-day but the results of our labour? The results of our labour are paid for with labour, and therefore, if we are enabling the people of Great Britain to get their butter for10d. per lb., whereas we at home have to pay 1s. per lb., then John Bull has only to pay us ten pennyworth of labour for his pound of butter, whereas we have to give twelve pennyworth of labour for it ourselves. Thus we enable him to be prosperous at our expense. I will deal now with what is known as the great labour question. I say, emphatically, that there is more involved in this fiscal policy, as far as the coloured race question is concerned, than some honorable senators seem to imagine. If we look into the matter closely we will find that the cost of production is pretty much the same all over the world. In the countries where the highest wages are paid you will find that the cost of the production per unit of product is less than in countries where low wages are paid. If we desire to develop our own resources, and, if we desire to enable other countries to become prosperous in order that they may take our products, then the best thing we can do is to receive their products as free as possible from burdens and enable them also to have ours as free as possible. Take the case of a race that has been spoken of in this Senate as being an inferior one. What do we find ? </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; in the mill. But what are the facts in regard to that mill. There we have eight or nine men engaged there every year and all the year round, not casual labourers coming and going, but men with fixed employment in the mill, some of whom have been there for from ten to fifteen years, and who have to work there in the summer time in a perfectly nude condition. But you find no such state of affairs in the sugar fields. There is no heat so oppressive in the sugar fields, because whatever little ventilation you get from Heaven you get out in the open air. And yet it is often asked - " Will white men do this particular kind of work ? " Now the men I refer to have worked in that mill not only one summer, but summer after summer, and I therefore think it is preposterous for persons to ask will white men do this particular class of labour? -Do white men work our ships in the tropics and work in the stoke-holes of the steamers ? Do they discharge cargo ? I have seen them in Townsville and other northern ports, in the height of summer, working when the heat was most oppressive. Is there any difficulty in finding labour to do that work, or are the ships stopped for want of men to work them from port to port? When we have men working in the stoke-holes of steamers in the tropics, working in the mines, cutting the jungle, driving tunnels and laying down railway lines, it is absolutely preposterous to ask whether white men can work in the sugar fields of Northern Queensland. It is preposterous. These statements are put forward in a plausible way, and may carry at any rate some conviction to the minds of certain persons who are not very well informed. But those of us who have come from Queensland, who have visited the sugar-fields and other fields of labour, simply brush the question aside. Not because we wish to treat it contemptuously, but because we know that these statements, are unfounded and cannot be supported. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must know it was contended years ago that it was unnecessary to use the slave labour in the West Indies, but such was the vast sum involved that Great Britain, in a skilful and tactful way, got over the difficulty by paying a handsome sum to get rid of slave labour. I laid down in my policy, when before the electors in 1896 and 1899, that if I had an opportunity I would stop this immigration at the earliest possible date. I would do that. I hope the Government will bring the question to a close at the earliest possible moment. The agreements now entered into extend over a period of three years. Some of them expire in a few months, so that at the end of five or six years we should be able to get clear of kanaka labour. As a practical man, however, I recognise that we must deal with the question in such a manner that the abolition of the kanakas from Australia will be the least irksome, and that the loss and possible heart-burnings to the people engaged in this industry will be as little as possible. A good deal has been said with regard to the great subject of free-trade versus protection. I am almost afraid to touch upon it. It has been handled in so many ways. It is just as well, however, while we are dealing with the question of the best means of raising revenue, for me to give my views. I have listened with profound attention to the arguments advanced on both sides. I have heard them all with the exception of those put forward on Wednesday of last week, when I was unable to be present. So far as I have been able to follow the discussion, and as far as I have been able to read this question, I am in favour of protection as against free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- It has been urged with great force that Great Britain has made mightier strides, and increased her population and wealth to a greater extent than some of the protectionist countries. I deny that. I say America has made far greater strides in her population and wealth under' protection than Great Britain has done during the last half century. </para>

                    <para>If, during the next 25 years, Great Britain loses her trade as rapidly as she lias during the quarter of a century from 1870 to 1895, she will have yielded her primacy as the greatest of the world's commercial powers. If, in the quarter of a century ending in 1924, the same industrial progress is held by the United States as has marked the closing years of the present century, the United States will lead the world in export trade, with Germany second, and Great Britain third. </para>
                    <para>The marvellous expansion of the export trade of the United States during the last few years has led certain English economists to assert and believe that England, despite the world's competition, still holds her pre-eminence as the greatest exporting nation ; that while other nations have obtained their share of the world's commercial expulsion, England's supremacy remains unassailed. Admitting, as they do, that Germany now controls certain industries formerly monopolized by Great Britain, and that the sceptre of the iron and steel trade has pissed out of their hands into those of the United States, it is still the belief of English students of trade movements that England has nothing to fear from its commercial rivals. These hopes are false. England is steadily losing her control of the world's markets. </para>
                    <para>An examination of this table shows that, in the quarter of the century, Russian exports increased 17 "35 per cent. ; German, 42-90; French, 20'40 ; the United States, 1 110-66; British, 13-17. Put in another form, the loss of British commerce becomes even more apparent. In the period from 1870 to 1895, the aggregate export trade of the five great commercial nations of the world increased 34 '70 per cent., while Great Britain's share of the increase was only 13-17 per cent. In 1870, Great Britain did a trifle more than 75 per cent, of the total of the commerce of the great industrial nations ; in 1895, her share was a trifle under 30 per cent. In twenty-five years, she has not only not held her position, but she has lost some of the trade she held in 1870, and gained nothing by the commercial expansion of the world. It was because of this loss that the </para>
                    <para>In 1870, one quarter of the world's commerce (exclusive of the British colonies and dependencies) was done by England ; including her colonies and dependencies, 35 per cent.. In 1895, Great Britain's share of the world's commerce had fallen to a fraction less ti ian 18 per cent. ;' or including her colonies and dependencies, it had declined to 31 per cent. ; showing that while she still retained her supremacy as the leading commercial factor of the world, her power was waning instead of growing. </para>

                        <para>In 1 860 the population of the United States was in round numbers 31,000,000. At the same time the population of the United Kingdom was in round numbers 29,000,000. The wealth of the United States at the time was 14,000,000,000 dols ; the wealth of the United Kingdom was 29,000,000,000 dols. The United Kingdom had therefore nearly the same population, but more than double the wealth of the United States, with machinery for manufacturing four-fold greater than that of the United States. At the end of twenty years (1880), it appeared that the United States' had added nearly 30,0p0,000,000 dols. to her wealth, while the United Kingdom had added nearly 15,000,000,000, or about one-half. </para>

                        <para>Let us see how the agricultural States fared during this period. By the census of 1860, eight agricultural States of the West (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin) returned an aggregate wealth of 2,271,000,000 dollars. Twenty years afterwards, by the census of 1880 (protection all the while in full .force), these same States returned an aggregate wealth of 11,268,000,000 dollars. The rate of increase for the twenty years was 396 percent., or 180 per cent, greater than the increase in the eight manufacturing States of the East. </para>

                            <para>- I will ask my honorable friends on the other side, who are extremely anxious to preserve our industries, provided they can be preserved by opening our ports to the cheap products of the world, whether they are prepared to advocate that our females should compete with the females of Japan, who are paid 2?d. to5d. a day? So far as I am concerned, I am not, and I am not anxious to bring about competition between our male labourers and Japanese who are paid from 5d. to 8d. per week.Iam anxious to preserve wages, to insure comfort in our homes, and to give to our families more of the joys , and sweets of life than they can get now. </para>

                            <para>- I am bound to say that it is a new way of preserving our industries, and keeping up a high standard of living to open our ports and invite competition from the cheap products and cheap labour of other parts of the world. I had a little taste in my early life of low wages and poor conditions. When I was born my father had the magnificent sum of 10d. per day as a labourer working for a noble lord in the north of Ireland. I was one of four children attempted to be brought up or dragged up on that handsome sum, and at an early period of my life I made up my mind that I should endeavour to get the best wages I possibly could for my work, and would endeavour to assist my fellow men to procure the best possible conditions consistent with reasonable work. But at my time of life, bordering on 60 years, I am not anxious, whatever anxiety may be shown by my friends on the other side of the chamber, to bring about the wretched conditions of which I had some little experience in my youth. If my friends are anxious to do that, the responsibility must rest on them, but I shall not be a party to it. </para>

But before the Tariff Bill is disposed of I venture to say I shall be able to answer the honorable member on that point, and on every other; but let us deal with some of the allegations made concerning the prosperity of New South Wales, as compared with Victoria. I happen to have no animus against either one colony or the other. New South Wales is a neighbour of ours, and we hope to work in a friendly and amicable way with her, as we do with Victoria. But in this great national assembly we know no one province ; we know all the provinces and all the people, and it is our bounden duty, and ought to be our pride and pleasure, to do everything we can which will bring the greatest amount of prosperity to our people. A great effort was made to show the prosperity enjoyed by the people of New South Wales as compared with the people of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- There is one matter I have discovered dining this controversy, and that is that many of the representatives of labour and trades unionism call themselves free-traders. I am bound to confess that I am absolutely astonished and amazed at how they can reconcile their position. The very essence of trades unions is that they are protective institutions, for the protection of people engaged in various industries. I have been a trades unionist since 1860, and I am one now. But I certainly could not reconcile my position as a trades unionist if I were to proclaim aloud to the world that I was a free-trader - a free-trader in labour and production. Some honorable members say, " We are very anxious to exclude black labour, but not to keep out its productions." I am anxious to keep them both out. I would keep them out for a variety of reasons, and not exclusively because the black labourer competes with some of our white labourers. That is one reason, and a very good one ; but there are other reasons, moral and otherwise. But to open our ports and give facilities for the productions of these people to come into competition with the labour of our boys and girls and men and women is, to my mind, an absolutely incomprehensible position. </para>

                            <para>- Then, dealing with the question of old-age pensions, it is asked, " where are we to get the money to provide pensions for our aged people " ? Is it by a low Tariff? I think not. I think we should have a reasonably high Tariff, which will insure reasonable wages and preserve our industries, and keep our people employed. But we must look to the Government to raise sufficient money to provide for our aged poor and invalids who are unable to work for themselves. </para>

                            <para>- I shall heartily join in any reasonable system of direct taxation which will aid in that direction. If it can be procured without going to the Customs house all right, but one of the means of raising a reasonable sum of money to assist in that direction will for some time to come be the Customs house. I am sure our friends on the other side are perfectly honest and sincere with regard to excluding Asiatics and getting rid of kanakas. How is that to be done by means of a cheap and low Tariff? Take the duty that is now levied on sugar in New South Wales. It is ?3 per ton, whereas in Victoria it is ?6. The duty of New South Wales is the lowest that some of our friends would go to. Is that going to assist us to keep clear of this particular class of labour? Not at all. I hope our friends will on this matter rise to the occasion, and assist us to get clear of coloured labour, but that can only be done by making some sacrifice and putting on a sufficiently high protective duty, which will enable our planters to abolish this labour and employ white men in the sugar fields, paying them a reasonable wage and providing reasonable conditions. </para>

                            <para>- Is it unreasonable to ask that the whole of the people should pay a very small sum indeed for the purpose of establishing a white race on this continent - for the purpose of carrying out that great principle ? One gentleman said he had some pride of race ; so have I. I believe every honorable senator has a pride in preserving Australia for the white races. But if this great industry is to be preserved, surely our friends will be prepared to make some little sacrifice to preserve it and bring about this great change, which will not only prove beneficial to themselves, but of lasting benefit to those who come after us. </para>

I want to see patriots rise to the occasion, and show that they are patriots prepared to make some little sacrifice for the establishment of this great principle of a white Australia ; but if this principle can only be secured provided there is nothing to pay for it and no sacrifice made, then away with your patriotism and your sham nonsense and your desire to see a white Australia. I do not aim at establishing something by the destruction of something else. I do not wish to prolong the discussion any further, and I thank honourable members for the attention they have given me. I trust that the same spirit of forbearance, the same good temper that has characterized our proceedings from the beginning, will always be manifested in the Senate ; and that, when we come to deal with those great measures which have been foreshadowed, we shall have only the one - to do the best for the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I have always thought that our seamen, who constitute a very great part of the workers of Australia, ought not to be disfranchised because they do not happen to be in port on the day of the elections. I know that is not the rule throughout the States. It would be a reasonable request to make that the master of a vessel should be the returning officer for the time being in case of an election, and that he should be required to telegraph the returns immediately on reaching the nearest port. There might be a provision that in the event of the returns being delayed for a week or a fortnight - whatever limit might be agreed upon - owing to the vessel being some distance from port, the votes should not count. In this way the elections would not be delayed. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite agreeable to do that. I am willing to listen to any suggestion. What I want to do is to establish the principle, and I sincerely hope that the Ministerial leader in the Senate will take notice of the remarks of the few who, like myself, are anxious to see old age pensions established at an earlier date than is indicated in the Governor-General's speech. One subject on which a good deal of remark has been made is that of the transcontinental railway to Western Australia. I think that the consideration of that proposal involves also the consideration of other works perhaps quite as large. I am free to admit that I have not 'been able to acquire any information about the route to be traversed or the probable traffic on the line to justify me in giving a hard and fast opinion at this stage, and I believe the majority of the senators stand on exactly the same ground. I have no doubt that the information which is being compiled by the Parliament of South Australia, or the Parliament of Western Australia, or by both, and by the Commonwealth Parliament, will be placed in the hands of the members of both Houses at as early a date as possible. I am quite sure that the project will be given full consideration to, and that even honorable members who so far have expressed themselves as antagonistic to the idea - perhaps because they are not in possession of sufficient information - will give fair consideration to the reasonable request of the members from Western Australia. I say reasonable request for this reason - that although the evidence which is placed in our hands may show that this stupendous work is not justifiable at present, still, until we get that information, we are not in a position to say that it is not justifiable. I said just now that- the consideration of this line involves also, in my opinion, the consideration of a line to the Northern Territory. I think that it would certainly be a wise procedure on the part of the Common wealth Government to get. control of the Northern Territory as soon as it possibly can, because we are told by the Parliament of South Australia that they possibly will not consent to carry on the administration of that territory for many years longer at an annual loss of ?100,000, which I understand they have been making for the last two or four years. </para>

                        <para>Some time ago I, being a colour-sergeant in charge of our detachment, read a regimental order stating that in future all officers would be appointed from the ranks, and at the request of the men here I applied for a commission, which was recommended by the captain of my company. About a fortnight after I attended the class of instruction, which lasted three weeks. About the middle pf last week I was taken before the commandant, who told me- that, although I had the ability, he would not recommend me for a commission because my social position was not good enough, and he only wanted men for officers who were in a position to visit Government House. </para>

                            <para>- When they have the power I hope that should the smaller States need it they will receive generous treatment at the hands of the Commonwealth Parliament. In leaving this interminable Tariff argument, let me say that I believe the imposition of such a Tariff as is acknowledged by all the senators, free-traders, and protectionists alike, to be necessary for the working of the Commonwealth, and for the exigencies of the various States, will afford a fair amount of protection, added to which the freight and insurance will give some protection to native industries. And if this incidental protection assists in maintaining the industries that are now flourishing in Australia, then I, for one, shall not object; in fact, I shall rather welcome it. I think that after a little while, when we get to know each other better, we shall find that there are not many rabid free-traders or protectionists amongst us. We shall display a spirit of compromise, and the freetrader who admits that he wants to get a certain amount of revenue will consent to hear himself called a moderate protectionist. </para>

                            <para>- It does not matter what they are called. If the principle is there, if they admit that they have to raise this revenue, and that the raising of revenue necessarily brings about a certain amount of incidental protection, then they cannot get over the fact that that protection must, to a certain extent, protect native industries. Before resuming my seat, and thanking the senators for listening so attentively to my remarks, which probably have been very disjointed, I would like to say, on behalf of the party to which I belong, that it is here in the same federal spirit as any other party. A little time ago one hardly dared to mention the words " labour party " in connexion with any respectable politician. But the feeling of the people now is that all classes of the community have an inherent right to be represented in Parliament. We have no desire to turn things topsy turvy or upside down. I am quite satisfied that the members of the labour party in this House; and in another place will be able to conduct themselves with the same amount of decorum, and the same amount of respect to the Chair, and the same amount of tolerance fur other members, as other senators. I am quite satisfied that it is the desire of the labour party to assist the free-traders and the protectionists, and those representing other classes of the community, to make this nation of Australia a strong one, and Australia a good land to live in. I am also satisfied that the conduct of the members of the labour party in this Chamber, and in another place, will be such that when they go before their constituents in three years' or in six year's time, as the case may be, the feeling which as I say existed a few years ago, will then have been entirely swept away, and the people of Australia, as a whole, will be thoroughly satisfied that men can be members of a labour party, and at the same time respected members of a community and of a Parliament. I hope, nay, I am satisfied, that the other members of the party in this Chamber, are of the same opinion as I am ; that we shall not do anything to bring discredit upon the Senate. It is our desire, as it is the desire of other honorable members, to take our place in building up a great nation, and in making Australia a good and happy land to live in. </para>
