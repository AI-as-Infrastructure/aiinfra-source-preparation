If we are going to have any returns - and, of course, the motion is moved with an object - showing the position which the different senators took on the poll, I think we might as well have a statement of the expenses incurred by each senator in and about his election. Therefore, I move - </para>

Therefore, it will be necessary to have, this motion so framed as to enable honorable senators, when the return is produced, to determine exactly what number of primary votes each successful candidate got. When the subsequent counts are completed and the six men are duly elected, we find in the ordinary course that the six have the quota. Some persons are under the impression that each of the successful six are on terms of equality. I should like the motion to be so framed that the Senate would be able to ascertain the exact number of primary votes which the successful candidates obtained. </para>

So far as Tasmania is concerned, the motion should be so framed that the Senate may know the number of primary votes or the first-choice votes accorded to the three men at the top of the poll, and the number of similar votes accorded to the other three. </para>

                        <para>- In that case I fail to see on what principle the honorable senator proposes to use this return. It may possibly be that the order of primary votes of one of those who have been returned highest on the poll would have been different if the whole of the votes had been counted before his name was struck out of some of the ballot-papers on which his name was of no use, because he had obtained the quota. I take it that numbers are counted 'up to the quota first in Tasmania, and that after a candidate has arrived at the quota, his name is discarded from all future ballot-papers. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that this is a very simple matter. The honorable senator from Western Australia informs us that the returning officer has these documents sealed up. There is nothing unusual in that, for the same procedure is followed in this State. The papers are retained for a time in case of a disputed election, so that the ballot can be recounted. I have in my hands a statement of the ballot in Western Australia as declared by the returning officer at the poll. </para>

                        <para>- Well, then, in two of the States it might be possible to obtain this information. With regard to the others there is no law by which we can compel senators to disclose the amount of their expenditure, and I can say on behalf of the Government that they will certainly not ask for any information which they cannot insist on having supplied to them. If the motion were carried in this amended form the Senate would be making an order which it would be out of the power of the Government to comply with. </para>

                    <para>- It requires very grave consideration,because of the essential principles of the equality of representation. In respect of each State it is essential that the full voting power should be exercised, unless there is some constitutional reason to the contrary, upon every question that comes before us, Every member of the Senate, according to the old parliamentary rule, who is in the chamber at the time the vote is taken is obliged to exercise his vote. I mention this matter now as this is the first occasion upon which the point has really arisen, in order that you may be able to give it consideration, and that the Senate may give it consideration and arrive at some conclusion. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall be perfectly prepared to move the second reading of this Bill, which relates to the postal and telegraph services of the Commonwealth, to-morrow, and then to allow the debate to stand over till such time as may be convenient to the Senate. If there is a general feeling on the part of senators that it is desirable that the second reading should not be moved until next week, I will take the second reading on Wednesday. Of course, it will be understood that should we make good progress with business to-day, there will be very little work for the Senate to do next week, if this Bill is not read a second time until Wednesday next. </para>

                    <para>- I think that honorable members will find it more convenient generally to meet on Friday morning than on Friday afternoon. If we meet on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons, and on Friday morning, it will be possible for a large number of them to get away to their homes every Friday afternoon. I understand that, as far as the representatives of Tasmania are concerned, it would be a convenience, as they would be able to return to their homes and come back by a boat leaving Tasmania on Tuesday and arriving here on Wednesday. The train to South Australia leaves between 4 and 5 o'clock p.m., so that representatives of the State would also the have an opportunity of spending a few days at home before resuming their duties. Senators from New South Wales would be convenienced in exactly the same way. Our friends from Queensland are rather too far away, but, possibly, this arrangement would convenience them in certain instances. Of course, senators from Western Australia will have to wait for their transcontinental railway before they can take advantage of this proposal. So far as the Victorian members are concerned, I have no doubt they will under the circumstances make arrangements to attend on Friday mornings. It will, of course, inconvenience those residing in Melbourne, but we must ask them to put up with that for the sake of the majority of members. I therefore beg to move as an amendment - </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend has an inventive genius, and if he would apply that genius to the invention of a flying machine, we should be prepared to encourage him, so as to enable honorable members to return to their homes at the end of the week. The effect of sitting from Monday till Saturday would be to place us very much in the position of the celebrated French king, who led his army up the hill and marched it down again, because, according to the notice-paper, there will probably be no necessity for us to meet next week, and the representatives of Queensland and Western Australia will be able to take a trip home. After comparing the notice-paper of this Senate with that of another place, I feel that the three days provided for the business of the Senate will scarcely be occupied for some time to come. It will certainly be a very great convenience to meet at 10.30 a.m. on Friday, and we may be well content with the statement of the Minister that there is an understanding that there will be no late sittings unless the business requires it. If they are required, then we shall all be ready to devote ourselves as strenuously as we can to the completion of our work. </para>

It is customary in certain places for formal motions to be taken, even if they relate to the business of private members. The motion may be for papers that are urgently required in order that some question coming before the Chamber may be dealt with. I shall not move an amendment if the Postmaster-General will accept my suggestion and insert the words. </para>

                        <para>- In this State the Legislative Council used to meet on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The whole of Wednesday was given up to private members, subject, of course, to there being sufficient private business on the notice paper; and if there was not sufficient private business on the notice paper, Government business went on. It is a perfect farce to allow the motion to stand as it is, because the Government might practically monopolize the whole of the time of the Senate, and private members would have no regard shown to them. </para>

Therefore I propose to move the omission of the words. </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the use of the terms formal and unopposed, I see that May in his Parliamentary Practice makes a distinction between the two. On page 210 of the 10th edition there is this marginal note: "Formal motion during time for unopposed business," clearly indicating that they are two distinct things. In Victoria we have been accustomed to the term unopposed motion. It does appear to me that the term unopposed defines more clearly what we mean than the term formal, and as it appears to be given a definition in May, I think we might very well adopt the word unopposed rather than the word formal. </para>

                    <para>- A formal motion is one which would be taken without debate, but on which the Senate might divide. An unopposed motion would be a motion on which the Senate could not divide, because it was unopposed. I have seen the case where a motion has been taken as a formal one, but a division has been called for and it has been negatived. </para>

                        <para>- Of course he will be. When the Government have the business in hand, they have a full sense of responsibility. Honorable members seem more inclined to stop in the House on such occasions. If from half-past ten o'clock to four o'clock, at any rate in the early days of the session, is set aside to private business honorable senators will find that there will be ample opportunity for them to bring forward and discuss any matters which they consider ought to be discussed, but which cannot be so well taken up by the Government. I shall not move an amendment unless I find that it is in accord with the wishes of honorable senators generally. I think it would be a convenience to fix the hour at four o'clock, because honorable senators would say - we can go to the Senate at half-past ten o'clock, knowing that we can get away at four o'clock, whatever the state of business may be, unless there is some important Government business to be brought forward, when, of course, we should make a point of remaining to discuss it. I doubt whether for some time to come we shall have business to carry us on to four o'clock on Friday. </para>

                    <para>- With regard to the suggestion about fixing a definite hour at which we should adjourn, I wish to state what our experience in that connexion was in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. There was a certain popular motion before the House. It was a proposition that a minimum rate of wage be paid to all Government labour. There was clearly a majority in the House in favour of the motion, but there was a very substantial minority against it. There was a standing order to the effect that private members' business should be adjourned at four o'clock. Private members' day after private members' day passed, and on each occasion this private members' motion was consistently stonewalled. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly it is most desirable, and we in Victoria are most desirous of falling in with the suggestion of honorable senators from other States in order to facilitate their return to their homes. Subsequently, when we altered this standing order, there was a general understanding amongst honorable members that we should adjourn at four o'clock, and we did consistently adjourn at that hour. So I would suggest that it certainly would be desirable to have an understanding that we should adjourn at that hour, but that it would be a very great mistake to adopt a cast-iron standing order. Our experience is certainly against that. </para>

                        <para>- If the time is limited to four o'clock that means that we have four and a half hours. I do not think that gives sufficient time to deal with any business. Surely when senators are only sitting three days a week, they will not object to sitting three full days4 I think the proposal for Friday morning sittings is simply made to allow a number of senators to go away altogether on Friday. Have we any guarantee that the senators, who will be advantaged in this respect, will put in an appearance at all on Friday. I doubt very much whether they will. They will probably forsake the chamber, with the result that there will be no&gt; quorum. </para>

                        <para>- There will be a stampede on Thursday evening, because of their being no important business to transact - only private business. Private business is no doubt important to the private members bringing it forward, but other private members do not think so much about it. The way to keep honorable members here would be to have Thursday for private business; they would then have to remain over Friday for the Government business. It appears to me that those who are likely to bring private business forward- I do not indulge in the luxury much myself - had better think this matter over and see whether it would not be better to substitute Thursday for Friday. </para>

Although theoretically there can be only one amendment before the Senate, other members may speak, and indicate amendments which will be moved at a later stage. When the amendments are put, they will be put in order, and if the original motion is amended then a new question arises, and every member can speak again. When they are speaking, they can speak to the motion and to all the amendments that have been proposed or suggested. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that we are having rather a funny debate. There are two honorable Ministers in this Chamber and some thirty members, and when Ministers say they will give us from half-past ten to half-past six in the evening, some of us are replying - " You have offered us a loaf and we prefer to take half a loaf." The reason why some senators suggest that we should adjourn at four o'clock is that while they go to their own homes, others, who are not able to do so, may rush some important private business through the Senate. I do not intend to listen to that argument. It appears to me that it is too much taken for granted that at four o'clock every Friday we are to adjourn. I am sure that every senator cannot go to his home at the end of each week, and as far as I am personally concerned, I am afraid that </para>

                <para>I will not be able to see Hobart until Cup time. We are to adjourn at four o'clock when that can be reasonably done ; but it should not be taken for granted that throughout the session we shall adjourn at that hour. I have not had the pleasure of serving in an Upper House before; but it appears to me that"' for the first six weeks, or two months, we shall have "little to do, and it will make very little difference whether our friends from South Australia or New South Wales go away at four o'clock on Fridays or not. For the last three months of the session, however, we shall have more than we can do. Therefore, I think that the proposal of the Government is an exceedingly fair one. We should take what private members' time we can get. I am perfectly sure that during the last two months the Government will have to encroach on private members' time. There is an enormous amount of work on the notice-paper of another place, and we shall have to deal with that at a period when we are fagged out, and when we wish to go home. Then these sessional orders will have to go, and we shall have to sit three or four days a week. </para>

                    <para>-I have listened with great interest to the remarks of honorable members who have had experience of the difficulties arising in connexion with private business in State Legislatures. Many of the arguments which have been addressed to us by those who are in favour of fixing a certain hour for the closing of private business on Friday are based on a premise which has no foundation whatever, that is, that the whole of the time allotted for private business will be availed of by private members. The real point appears to me to be that private business on certain days and for a certain time should have precedence of Government business. If certain hours are fixed for private members' business, it does not necessarily follow that honorable members will avail themselves of the whole of that period. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to support the Government in this matter. It appears to me that there is a much stronger desire in the minds of many honorable members to get home than to do the business of the country. All I have to say to those honorable senators is that, if they are so very fond of their homes, they ought to have stayed there ; they should not have submitted themselves for election to this Parliament. We are here to do the business of the country, and those of us who come from Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania, and cannot get home- </para>

It is not considered to be good form, but we are at the beginning of a new Parliament, and the Government and honorable members of both Chambers ought to remember that this is not an ordinary Upper House. There are two wheels to this legislative machine, and the upper wheel is just as powerful as the under wheel. If the Government allows this wheel to remain inactive for two months - for practically that is what I understand the Government mean to do- </para>

                        <para>- Then the business of the Government is not going to be carried on as it ought to be. Why should not some of those Bills have been submitted to us instead of the solitary one that has been brought before the Senate? This is a direct attempt to lower the Senate in the eyes of the Commonwealth, and should be resented by every senator. Action of this kind does not tend to good legislation. Every one of the Bills I have referred to will have to come up to the Senate, and why should not some of them be introduced here. Why not utilize the energies of honorable members who are here in dealing with these Bills, instead of telling them that next week there will be nothing at all for them to do. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member speaks in a very doleful tone of voice. No doubt he is very anxious to eliminate the figure " 4" and substitute something larger. My reason for supporting the Government is that I think the limitation of hours proposed in the amendment would not be a step in the right direction. Senators from Queensland have had a sharp experience of how a rule of that kind works. It simply means that instead of a private member ventilating a particular matter, and other members having an opportunity of discussing it, members of the Government who are opposed to the proposal get up and occupy the whole time at the disposal of the House. I think the proposal of the Government is a fairly liberal one, although, for my own part, I would rather see no limitation of private members' business. It would be much better - it would stop stone-walling, at all events - if it were permissible to carry on the business to a conclusion. </para>

                    <para>- When we commenced this discussion it was upon a question of whether formal business or unopposed business should take precedence of private business. As far as these two matters are concerned, I think it would be much better to say simply that on Fridays private members' business shall all take precedence. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators will see that the next motion on the business paper is one for the appointment of a Standing Orders Committee, to whom the draft standing orders will be remitted. I understand that the Committee will get to work soon after it is appointed, and that there will be no great delay on their part. I therefore, with considerable confidence, would ask the Senate to allow these standing orders which have been lying on the table since the 23rd May, and which I presume have been carefully read and studied by honorable senators to be adopted temporarily. "We have got on very well without any standing orders, but I think all honorable senators will admit that it is desirable that at the earliest possible stage we should have standing orders, so that we may know exactly where we are, and how it is necessary for us to conduct the debates. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>This chapter relates to the previous question. A number of honorable senators have discussed the rules in this chapter, and, besides considering them unnecessary, I for one think that they place too much power in the hands of a single senator. Any one may rise and move a motion similar to th previous question, that is, that the question be not now put. Let me show the difference between "being now put" and "being not now put." If it is carried that the question be not now put it is shelved altogether. If on the contrary it is carried in the other direction then the question has to be put without further discussion or further amendment, and any senator may at any time get up and burk discussion or shelve any business that may come before the Senate. I think it is the duty, at this stage of any senator who has any objection to the draft standing orders to make this objection so that it may go before the Standing Orders Committee. There is another standing order which may be of very great importance to the senators from one State. Standing order 53 provides for the moving of the adjournment of the House for the purpose of allowing senators to carry on what some persons may call an informal discussion, and what others may call a discussion of a matter of very urgent importance. </para>

There are only six representatives of each State, and there are only 36 senators altogether. Possibly on some occasion a question might arise which was of vital importance to one State ; and unless a senator from that State could get the support of some senators from another State the question could not be discussed at all. </para>

                        <para>- I am only indicating to the Standing Orders Committee the objections which have been raised, and which I raise, to the draft standing orders. The original standing orders were of such a character that even the Government themselves were prepared to alter them. I have not the least doubt that if honorable senators are in a position to explain defects, there may be other standing orders which would be altered by the Standing Orders Committee. If that body do not effect all the alterations which are really necessary in the opinion of a good many senators a discussion will arise. If we assist the committee by expressing our opinions now we may have less difficulty in adopting the standing orders which may be framed. I would like to hear other honorable senators express their differences of opinion in the same frank way as I have done. I move this amendment as an indication to the Standing Orders Committee that it is not fair to put the Senate in such an awkward position that its deliberations can be thwarted or interfered with by a single representative. If it is not carried, I hope the committee will consider my suggestion, and that the Senate will be prepared to give it more serious consideration when the matter again comes before us. </para>

                        <para>- Not to the extent to which it is sought to be done here. This is a new matter. We are now dealing with the proceedings of this Senate, and we have no standing orders to guide us. We have got along exceedingly well with the care of the President, and our own good sense, without any standing orders at all, and when we come to conduct our proceedings by reference to some set of standing orders, we ought to make sure that even temporarily, we do not adopt a code which is, to a large extent new, and which contains provisions not included in any other set of standing orders in Australia with which I am acquainted. Now the course which has been suggested from another side of the chamber is that which occurred to me as the wisest. Why should we not do as the Convention did, adopt some set of standing orders with which we are acquainted, and of - which we have experience. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and with which many members are familiar and which we could use as a basis of our proceedings without considering a scientific new code such as this. In the Convention we adopted with satisfactory results the standing orders of the House of Assembly of South Australia. I do not know whether they are as efficient or as suitable as the standing orders of some of the other Australian Chambers, but I think it would be very much better to do that. I want now to call attention to some exceedingly drastic orders which make me shiver. Not that I am likely to be bellicose and infringe them. </para>

                        <para>- I think it will be for months. We know how it will be when we come to deal with these standing orders in detail. At any rate we ought to be in the position that the representatives from any one State shall be entitled, without let or hindrance, to ventilate any definite matter of urgent public importance upon a motion for adjournment. The next matter is even more important and is contained in chapter 18, relating to the appointment of a Chairman of Committees ; Order No. ' 237. Now, if we adopt these standing orders temporarily we commit ourselves to the appointment of a Chairman of Committees in this Senate. I, for one, submit to the consideration of my honorable friends whether we ought to have a Chairman of Committees at this stage. It seems to me we are in great danger of overloading the machinery. We should be specially cautious as to the offices and salaries that we create in connexion with the Parliament. It is a very easy thing, with the wave of the hand, to appoint officers and apportion salaries, but it will be a very different thing when we come to see the expenditure in cold print in the Estimates, and we have to face the people of Australia, who have been insisting throughout the whole of this federal movement, and especially throughout the whole of the federal elections, upon economy being exercised. </para>

                        <para>- I do not move it. But I indicate that I intend to move an amendment on sections 53 and 237. I shall certainly vote against the appointment of a Chairman of Committees at this stage, reserving to myself at a later period, if the business of the Chamber becomes so considerable, and the calls upon you, sir, are so great that it will be unreasonable or improper that you should discharge those duties, the right of supporting the appointment of a Chairman of Committees. Until that necessity is established it seems to me we can hardly be considered as giving effect to our protestations in favour of economy in the parliamentary machine of the Commonwealth, unless we excise those appointments which are at present unnecessary. "We shall have to wait to see how this expenditure all tots up - how it will appear in cold print. With all these different offices we shall have an expenditure in connexion with the Parliament that I think we shall ourselves shrink from attempting to support before our constituents when the figures are put down in black and white. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that the House of Commons will not cut away that privilege, but they may subject it to restrictions just as we have done in some of our State Parliaments. In the South Australian Legislature we have placed restrictions on the freedom of debate, for we have a most efficient closure in the shape of a motion " That the House do now adjourn."' I feel as one who is anxious to maintain the privileges and powers of this House that this is a most salutary power in the hands of the Commons House, and it will be a salutary power in the Senate, particularly as we are the States House. At any moment a matter of great consequence may arise, which we from the States may wish to deal with. We may not have an opportunity of doing so on a motion for adjournment. Such a procedure is unsatisfactory,because any member may get up in the middle of the discussion and object to it. On the motion for going into" Committee of Supply he could not do that. Grievances must be ventilated, and this is the best privilege of a free Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- My suggestion is that when financial business comes before this Chamber, with respect to which we have larger powers than any ordinary House, that we should have some standing orders that would assimilate our procedure with that of the other House, and which would enable us to discuss grievances on going into committee of the whole. I have handed in an amendment which I move with the view of saving time, and to enable us to proceed with the business of this Chamber on what will be really temporary" standing orders. I think that the temporary standing orders should be those at present in force in either Chamber of some of the State Parliaments constituting the commonwealth, and that the committee whose names I have taken the liberty of indicating in my amendment should determine which are the most appropriate for our use until the other standing orders are adopted. </para>

What danger is there of any great time being occupied over the preparation of our standing orders. , We are all experienced men, and no doubt honourable members will take care that the committee to whom the orders are referred are men of experience in their different States. What necessity is there for all this long debate except that we have nothing else to do, and we might as well talk about this as disperse and say nothing at all. These standing orders have been brought before us by the President, whom we all esteem, and we are asked to accept them so as to have some rules during the few days which must elapse before we can make permanent standing orders. Why not adopt them ? It is the invariable rule, and is fraught with no danger. </para>

                            <para>- Those were the standing orders of that very important Federal Convention, and they appear to have given . satisfaction. We could at once agree to adopt them, but we cannot accept the draft standing orders even temporarily, because that may mean two or three months' work. </para>

                            <para>- Then the Government should build the post-offices if they are required, and I suppose if they are not required the Opposition would never think of bringing those matters before the House.. I hope the Postmaster-General will agree to the amendment. If not, then we must simply set to work and endeavour to do our best by striking out of the draft standing orders those which strike us as being irritating and frivolous. </para>

                            <para>- I think the standing orders may give the right to speak, but not to vote. A Minister in charge of a department has possibly taken great care in the preparation of a measure, and having mastered the details of it has proved his qualifications by carrying it through the other Chamber. Then the Bill goes on to the Upper House and is placed in charge of the representative of the Government there. While in the Victorian Legislative Assembly I had the advantage of able colleagues in the Upper House, yet it was my experience from time to time to sit in the Legislative Council's gallery and to hear requests made for information which it was impossible for the Minister in charge to supply without full inquiry. It was my experience to hear questions asked as to the objects of certain clauses, and to hear the Minister in charge give his own explanation probably after a hurried glance at the measure, which I had to correct subsequently. I consider this Chamber has at least the right to hear all the Ministers, to receive from them the fullest information, and to have the advantage of the study of those honorable gentlemen in connexion with measures that are being submitted. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite enough for a senator to deal with one subject at a time, but the number of honorable senators who will have to rise in their places should be reduced from seven to five. That alteration appears to me to be absolutely necessary, and if it is made I think there will not be the slightest difficulty for any honorable senator to rise and cause a discussion on any subject he may wish to have discussed. If his case is a fair one, he is sure to be able to get five honorable senators to rise in support of his motion. In the Legislative Council of Victoria we never had the slightest difficulty in discussing any question that any few honorable members might wish to bring forward, and I, cannot conceive that there will be any greater difficulty in the Senate. I think we might now fairly remit the whole matter to a committee, and in the meantime pass this amendment, remitting the matter to certain honorable senators simply to decide with verbal amendments which of the existing standing orders we should agree to and act under,, at all events for a few months. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators who have gone through the code have failed to recognise many of the standing orders as old friends ; at all events, if they are old friends, they have got such new faces that they cannot be recognised: I submit that the great bulk of these standing orders are such as can be adopted without any hesitation, doubt, or difficult)'. We should bear in mind that the committee cannot make any alterations, and therefore, with certain honorable senators, it will have to be a case of compromising a certain amount of principle for the time being. The Senate must put itself in exactly the same position as the Standing Orders Committee is placed in, and by that means it will facilitate our having a code to regulate our business, and do not bind ourselves to accept any one of the standing orders which are brought up. With regard to chapter 1 5 of the standing orders, there does appear to be some misapprehension of the object in putting the previous question. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable senators seem to assume the fact that it is only done to put an end to the debate at once, and that you can take a division by adopting some other method ; but really the object is to avoid taking a division. It may be that in the debate some question is raised on which it is undesirable in the public interest to give an expression of opinion by definite resolution. The time may be inopportune, or it may be a matter which may properly come on at a later period, but at that particular juncture it is undesirable to give a vote. Therefore the idea is that the previous question may be moved to enable the House to evade saying yes or no at that time ; but it does not preclude the House from considering the question at a later day if it feels so inclined. Even if we do omit chapter 15 of this code, the very first standing order provides that in all cases not provided for the practice of the House of Commons shall prevail. The practice of the House of Commons is to enable honorable members to have the previous question moved and considered, so that by striking out chapter 15 nothing would be gained unless the first standing order was also struck out. If we take that course we shall land ourselves in a sea of trouble, because there will be many questions arising on which we shall have to follow the practice of the House of Commons. I have no doubt that any standing orders we adopt will still provide for the Senate being able to have the previous question submitted to it for its consideration. </para>

                            <para>- I know that it is contrary to the practice of the House of Commons, and also contrary to the practice in the Parliament of New South Wales. Suppose that an honorable senator has spoken to a question, and some very important amendment is proposed. Is it not a reasonable thing that he should have an opportunity of making his opinion heard before the thing is put to a vote? His arguments might influence the House very greatly. That is a matter of considerable importance and the standing order should be altered so as to allow an honorable senator to speak, not only to the question, but also to each individual amendment that may be submitted from time to time. I do not want to go through the. whole of these orders. I have alluded to two or three of them, and I am now taking up the ground that it is better for us to have, for temporary purposes, standing orders that have been worked under, even if they be defective, and to let our Standing Orders Committee get to work as speedily as possible and bring up such a code as we can approve of and make suitable to the requirements of this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- I have been endeavouring to follow honorable senators as to what is to be gained by the adoption of this amendment. If we were likely to get a set of standing orders » with which honorable members were familiar I could understand the value of the amendment. But can we get them? I could understand it, too, if we adopted the South Australian orders, with which you, sir, after your long experience in that State, are so thoroughly familiar. But suppose we adopt the "Victorian or New South Wales standing orders, or, as suggested, the Queensland standing orders, might I be permitted to suggest that you would not be quite so familiar with them as with the standing orders of South Australia. If it were contended by the mover of the amendment and those who support him, that the South Australian standing orders should be immediately adopted, I could see some point in the argument. But very few honorable members are familiar with all the standing orders of the States, or, indeed, with any standing orders outside their own States. </para>

                            <para>- South Austral lia has sent more eminent legislators to the Federal Parliament than any other State has done. That is a proof that the South Australian representatives have been brought up in a very favorable atmosphere, that their powers as debaters have not been curbed and restricted by undesirable standing orders. We see here the effect of that favorable environment. Members from South Australia stand head and shoulders above the representatives from other States. I do not say this with any disrespect to other honorable senators, but seeing that the standing orders of South Australia have so favoured the production of able debaters and administrators I do not think we can go far wrong in adopting them temporarily. One good reason why these standing orders should be made clear and explicit was manifested in the Senate this evening. We had an honorable member getting up and tackling a question on the previous question, and the way in which he involved himself, the way in which he tied himself up into knots and turned the whole thing into a Chinese puzzle was absolutely amusing. I thought I saw his point clearly at the beginning, but before the honorable member sat down he had put me into the same' state of mental confusion as he seemed to be in himself. It is extremely desirable that that' sort of thing should be avoided. I was disappointed to hear several honorable members turn from the question to the question of limiting discussion. Some of them also referred to the standing orders of the House of Commons, and said we ought to be guided by that august assembly. I make bold to say that we could not have a worse example than the British House of Commons. This may appear to some honorable members to be rank heresy. The conditions existing in the House of Commons are quite different to those which exist here. The House of Commons is an unpaid assembly. The larger proportion of its members look upon legislation as a sort of gentle afternoon diversion. They do not consider it in the light of real business. We here are in a different situation. We are paid to do the work of the country. We are paid to discuss business. I am certain there is very little probability of free discussion in this - Chamber, seeing that we propose to sit only three days in the week, and I do not suppose that we shall remain here for more than six months in the year at the very outside. That being the case, I do hot think there is any reason whatever for the fear expressed by some senators that our discussions are likely to be of an extended character. We ought to invite discussion. Discussion is the very breath and life of legislation. I am aware that every honorable member thinks that, after he has spoken, everything that could be said upon the subject has been said. AVe are all more or less of that opinion. </para>

                            <para>.- The penalty of not doing it perhaps' might be explained by the senator who, being learned in the law, no doubt can offer some good reason. I do not think it is necessary that I should take up time by making any suggestions on the point, because I do not think they would be very relevant to the matter at issue. There are other proposed rules for governing the numbers on certain committees, and I find on the business paper some proposals to appoint sessional committees under the standing orders. I do not wish to raise the question of State against State, or anything of that kind, but we are sent here deliberately to represent each State. AVe are the States House, and I think that on important committees each State should have a representative. Standing orders Nos. 331 to 333 provide that nearly every one of these committees shall consist of five senators. I. see no reason why it should not consist of six. For instance, on the printing committee, why should there not be a representative of each State? Seeing the wide extent over which our operations are scattered, there may be the best of reasons to suppose that a senator representing say, Queensland, should be the best judge of what documents relating to that State are of sufficient value to be printed. </para>

                            <para>- Some do and some do not. I think there is very commonly a great deal of waste in connexion with parliamentary printing ; but that is no answer to my argument. Unless each State has a representative on these committees they are of- no avail as representative bodies. Our special function is to look after and represent the interests of the State. AVe are told that it is our duty rather to represent the States and the people of the States, if one can differentiate between the two. I know that </para>

                            <para>- Under the Queensland Standing Orders to which I have been more accustomed, although they may be faulty in some respects, it is always a rule that so soon as an amendment has been moved, the mover of the motion or in the case of Government business, the representative of the Government, shall have an opportunity at once to explain the attitude he takes in regard to the amendment. This appears to me to be very much -the better course to adopt. Judging by the speeches of honorable senators there appears to be a majority in favour of accepting the amendment. But I think the Senate in agreeing to the amendment will be making a mistake. In the first place, it appears to me to be entirely impracticable. If the intention of the mover of the amendment is that this small committee shall do the work it is asked to do, we are to decide which code of standing orders will be the most suitable for our purpose. We cannot conscientiously do this unless we are acquainted with all the codes of standing orders. It is all very well to say that there is a sort of understanding that we are to meet and agree to adopt the South Australian or Victorian, with a good deal more emphasis on South Australia than Victoria. But supposing we do this shall we not be told afterwards, when the terms of the resolution are quoted, that we solemnly decided that the standing orders of one of the Houses of the South Australian Parliament were preferable to those of the corresponding House of any other Parliament ? Is ' it fitting' that by an amendment to a motion a committee of senators should be appointed; and told that they are to do certain work, and present a report next day ? I do not know exactly at what time this debate will finish and the House adjourn, but very probably we shall have no time to do anything this evening. I do not know whether the senators who are named in the amendment are present. I am not aware of what their engagements may be. I am quite sure that my time will be all occupied to-morrow. </para>

                            <para>- What is the use of going through the farce of appointing a committee to do certain work and telling us at the same time it is perfectly understood that we are not going to do the work at all, simply because there is no time to do it. I trust that my name will not be included in the committee, because I feel that the whole tiling is a perfect farce, and that it will be utterly impossible for me, between now and to-morrow, to express an opinion as to whether the South Australian or Victorian standing orders are preferable. I think that some of the senators have underrated the work which has been undertaken by my honorable colleague and the officers of the Senate. We knew that it would be necessary that there should be standing orders. We considered, and I think senators will agree that it is exceedingly desirable that there should be standing orders as quickly as possible. What was done by my honorable colleague and the officers of the Senate was to compare the standing orders in use in the various States and to compile from them a code which we considered would be useful for the purposes of the Senate. I am informed that nine-tenths of these standing orders are South Australian. I think I may say there is hardly one that is not to be found in some code of standing orders, and that has not been probably tested by actual experience, in cases to which reference, if necessary, could be made. My colleague not only took infinite pains with regard to the standing orders in the first place, but when it was represented that some of them might be objected to, he withdrew the first lot, and excised all those which he thought might give rise to debate. In this matter he has done his very best to meet the wishes and consult the feelings of the members of the Senate. If the amendment that has been suggested is now carried, it will simply mean that, whereas we are appointing one Standing Orders Committee to draw up standing orders for us, we are now going to appoint another committee to recommend certain standing orders to fill up the interval, and they will be in just the same position as my honorable colleague and the officers of the House were in with regard to framing the present standing orders. </para>

                            <para>- If my colleague had come down and proposed that the South Australian standing orders should be the standing orders temporarily of this Senate, he would have been told that he was giving a preference to one State and to the senators of one State. There would have been a marked advantage in it. The senators who are from South Australia, and those who. were at the Convention, know those standing orders pretty well, and everything that is not according to those standing orders seems to be foreign and strange to them. The standing orders which have been referred as being strange have been taken from the codes of all the States. ' I do not know that any particular advantage is to be gained by adopting the standing orders of the South Australian Legislative Council. Seeing that up to the present time our debates have been conducted according to the standing orders of one Chamber of the South Australian Parliament, what will be the use of this committee recommending that they should be adopted It has been considered by the Government to be desirable that we should have standing orders specially fitted to the conditions of this Chamber, and hence these have been brought down. If honorable senators do not approve of that course, all that is necessary is to go no further. </para>

Of course, they can recommend this and re- ' commend the other, but they will certainly not make any inquiry which would justify them in making such a report. </para>

                            <para>- I think not, because the debate takes place on the question that the question be not now put. . If it is carried the House goes on to the next business ; if it is not carried then a division takes place. Now the other matter was with regard to the Chairmanship of Committees, There was nothing in the argument that it was desirable that this House should have some means of ventilating grievances, similar to the practice of bringing up grievances on a motion to go into a Committee of Supply. That has nothing to do with the question as. to whether we adopt these orders or not. As an instruction to the Standing Orders Committee, it might be useful, but it does not affect the question at all. With regard to the appointment of a Chairman of Committees, I cannot see how the Senate, by adopting ' these standing orders, would be compelled to proceed at once with the appointment of a chairman. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know whether they can. I quite agree with those senators who have expressed the opinion that we ought to have a Chairman of Committees as they have in another place. I believe in practising economy ; I hope it will always be practised. But it should not be practised at the cost of efficiency, or in such a way as will lower the status of this House. </para>

                            <para>- I presume the President could be appointed as Chairman. It was said also - and this was an argument which had some weight with some senators - that if this amendment is not accepted then we are going to have a long discussion on these standing orders. Well, do we gain anything to escape a long discussion by accepting the amendment? If the amendment is accepted it will mean that there will be a motion for the adoption of some other standing orders, and will there not be just as long a discussion on them ? Suppose this committee recommends the Victorian or Queensland standing orders - why should we not suppose they will recommend the Queensland standing orders - do we gain anything then ? In each case the proposal is for the temporary adoption of standing orders, pending the report of the Standing Orders Committee. If the amendment is accepted and it is proposed to temporarily adopt another code, there will be room for exactly the same discussion as there is here. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard that said, but I have very considerable doubt whether we can accept even the code of South Australia without modification. The senator who moved the amendment put in the words " with or without modification." Clearly it was in his mind that some modification might be necessary in order to make these -standing orders fit our circumstances. </para>

If we wish to complete the excellent service we have done to the country I think we should negative the resolution in its amended form. We have said that the standing orders proposed by the Government shall not be adopted in the meantime. We have not said any others shall be adopted. </para>

                            <para>- I misunderstood the earnestness, but when we find a very keen earnestness, in the absence of any occasion for it, we are apt to suspect that it comes from some other source. I see no reason why honorable senators on the other side need be so earnest in their desire to compel us to work under standing orders which they admit to be novel, when all we ask is that until we have had an opportunity of criticising these novel standing orders, they shall allow us to carry on our proceedings under standing orders that have been tried, and are known to possess the ordinary features of standing orders that have existed in these States. </para>
