                        <para>- I should like to ask the Postmaster-General a question referring to an intimation he gave some time ago as to the time for bringing under the notice of the Senate the subject of the rotation of senators. I understood the Minister to intimate that the matter would be set down for discussion in the first week in. July. I have to ask him to alter that date to meet the convenience of many senators. I understand that in the first week of July the Duke of Cornwall and York is to be in Tasmania, and I know that in the following week His Royal Highness is to be in South Australia. Of course these are exceptional occurrences, and it I would be very inconvenient for a number of honorable senators who are interested in the question - as we all are - to be present on those occasions. For that reason, I ask the Minister if he will alter the date for the discussion of the matter from the first week in J' July to some other time ? </para>

                    <para>- On a point of order, I wish to say that, of course, I have no objection to the proposed course being taken if the Senate desires it ; but I would point out that as we are fixing our practice now, it seems to me that the course proposed to be followed would constitute an evasion of the rule under which no senator can give notice of a motion including two questions. If this practice is to be followed, a senator could give one notice involving two matters and then split the one proposal into two motions. That course might prove inconvenient. </para>

Indeed, there is no great hurry, because the Commonwealth is not going to buy large areas of land suddenly.

                        <para>- In the Northern Territory there is a large area of land already alienated, and I wish to know the relationship in which the Commonwealth will stand n respect to that land, whether they are going to acquire the freehold from those who have already got it, and what method is to be adopted in arriving at the price to be paid for the land. It is for the purpose of protecting the public in this and other matters that 1 have moved my resolution. No one should, with the expectation of making exorbitant profits, enter into foolish investments in land that he may believe to be necessary for federal purposes. There is only one place that can be acquired for the federal capital out of the many that have already been offered or suggested, and the people ought to be protected by us against putting their mosey into land on the chance of it being required by the Government. If an instruction such as will be conveyed by my motion were given to the Government, the public would know that no matter what price they may have given for their land or what price they may expect to get they will not be able to obtain more than 10 per cent, above the assessed value. We know that in New South Wales, where the federal capital is bound to be, land is assessed for taxation purposes, whilst in the other States, if there is no assessment for State taxation purposes, there are assessments for the purposes of local taxation. Consequently if the Federal Government should need to acquire land in any of the States they would have something to guide them in arriving at the values. The terms of my motion do not compel the Commonwealth Government to give the 10 per cent, over and above the assessed value, but only prevent them from giving any amount in excess of that. In the hope that senators will give the matter fair consideration, I now move the resolution. </para>

                        <para>- It is a very good object. It is exceedingly desirable, but the motion in the form in which it is brought forward would not have that effect. We all desire to so arrange matters that the Commonwealth will not have to pay speculative prices for the land, but that it will pay exactly on the basis of the value of the land at the time immediately preceding the period when it was supposed that the property was to be acquired by the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I have been endeavouring to show why it would not be a reliable guide. In one case as I have said the property is deliberately valued low and the rating is high, while in another case. - perhaps in an adjoining municipality - the land is deliberately valued high and the rating is low, so that it would in no case be a fair basis of valuation. With regard to State taxation, I would point out that in some States they have not got it at all. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I should not like to do anything to hamper the Ministry which has so pronouncedly declared in favour of keeping the land which will be acquired by the Federal Government as federal property for all time. I do not agree with
                    that an expression of opinion by the Senate that not more than 10 per cent, should be paid in advance of the municipal valuation at the beginning of the year, would have any bad effect on the legislation which is likely to be passed in another House.
                    cannot assure us that there will be any provision of this kind in the Bill in regard to the price to be paid. What I imagine, from what
                    has said, is that the Bill will contain a provision for arbitration where there is a dispute as to the value of the land. I think that it would certainly have the effect desired by
                    if the Senate indicated in this way that it is desirous of seeing that a price not exceeding 10 per cent. on the valuation at a given date is paid for the land required for the federal capital. We know the efforts that are being made in various parts of New South Wales to secure the federal site, and we know, too, from our experience of land speculation and the demands of land-owners, that those people who have any idea that their site will be adopted by the Federal Government will require 400 per cent, or 500 per cent. more for their land than they would have asked for it four or five years ago.

                    <para>- I think that the object of the resolution deserves our warmest support, but the question is whether it would carry out what the honorable senator intends. It is really intended, I suppose, to be applied to the acquisition of lands for the federal capital. The honorable senator who has just spoken called attention to the fact that in the Constitution there is a provision that Crown lands shall be handed over free of charge. But included in a large tract of country such as is wanted, it is quite possible that there are private lands, which will need to be bought up. </para>

                    <para>- I am one of those who believe in the advice tendered by the Postmaster-General in regard to this motion, and that it is one that had far better been withdrawn after. it has been discussed. This course is advisable more especially in view of the fact that the Government have under consideration at the present time a measure dealing with the acquisition' of land for federal territory, purposes, and in that Bill they will make provision for a basis on which valuations are to be made and sums are to be paid for land acquired. I interjected whilst the Postmaster-General was speaking to the effect that there was a basis in the Bill very similar to that in the motion, and that interjection was actuated by the fact that I distinctly, recollect hearing the Prime Minister state to the electors that in considering this question the Government would not be prepared to pay fancy prices for land to be acquired - that provision would be made to enable the basis of the valuation to be the value of the land before it was determined that a particular portion of the country should be selected" for the federal site. With a declaration like that, honorable members may very well be content to allow matters to remain as at present. When the Bill comes before us, honorable members will be enabled to amend it in any way the Senate may consider desirable. The whole question if it is not settled satisfactorily or provided for satisfactorily in the Bill will be before us, and honorable senators will be able to mould the measure into any shape they think it ought to take. After all, we have to bear in mind that a question of this character must be determined by both Houses of Parliament- the opinion of one House cannot determine absolutely what has to be done. The opinion of this House must have weight with the other House as the opinion of the other House will naturally have weight with us. Let me also point out another objection to the motion itself. The honorable member talks about the assessed value on the 1st of January, 1901, for the State or municipal taxation ; but the Postmaster-General has pointed out how capricious municipal taxation is, and I need not trouble honorable senators any further in regard to that point. I will remind honorable senators, however, that only a very small portion of New South Wales .is under local government. </para>

                        <para>- I will come to that directly. The probability is that the bulk of the land taken up for federal purposes will be land not under any scheme of local taxation. I do not anticipate that the Government are going to resume any large towns or cities in the State of New South Wales for the purpose of establishing the federal capital. They may go close to some of the large towns, but the probability is those towns will not be included in the federal territory for the reason that it would cause an undue charge on the revenue of the Commonwealth, if there had to be paid the value of land that had been improved, and land that has received great additional valuation in consequence of what is termed the unearned increment. Then again as to land that has been valued for State taxation, let me remind honorable senators that, in New South Wales fit any rate, taxation is based on what is termed the unimproved value of the land. If we are going to take land with improvements, we must pay something more than we would if the land were in its native state and unimproved. If the honorable member says he intends this proposal to include any additional payment for improvements on the land, we are putting ourselves in the same difficult position he objects to be put in - that is we shall have to get men to come forward and value these improvements, and we may find great differences of opinion as to the values of particular areas. Therefore I think that is not a safe course to take. I believe it is the intention of every honorable member that owners of land which is resumed for State or public purposes shall be treated fairly and equitably. If ' the land is worth a certain amount the State or the Commonwealth does not want to take it away for less. And there is another matter to be considered. If I own a piece of land and it becomes necessary for State purposes that the Government should take possession of it, why should I be compelled, if I do not want, to sell it? </para>

                        <para>- I know that, and I am not asking for more than the honorable member contemplates, namely, a little extra value of 10 per cent. What does the honorable senator himself say? The honorable senator says that the extra value should not exceed 10 per cent, on the value on a particular day. He recognises that an added price should be paid for the land, and that is where the principle comes in. If a man is unwilling to part with his land he should get some little additional payment on account of his unwillingness. In the State of New South Wales, where we have provision for the acquisition of public land, it is invariably the practice for valuers to add a certain sum of money, something like 10 per cent., because of the compulsory purchase - because the land is taken away from a man, whether he desires to sell or not. In any case where we take land over for federal territory purposes, we should be actuated by the same spirit of reasonable concession and consideration for persons who rightly or wrongly have had land alienated to them. They have been put in possession of the* land on the implied promise and condition that they shall be protected in their holding. It is only when the public interest demands - and when the public interest demands, every man must give way - that it is taken away, that we make this small recompense by adding some little additional price to the ordinary value of the land. Ten per cent, is ample. I would not be prepared to sanction a larger amount being paid, and I do not say that in every case that should be paid. </para>

I take this to be only a little passing breeze, and there is an end of it. A great deal has- been said with reference to the site for the federal capital, which, as provided for by statute, must be somewhere in New South Wales, though where goodness knows. Reference has been made to the action I took in moving for a select committee, and let me say that I have not the faintest interest further than as a mere matter of public convenience in one site more than in another, and its regards anything in the nature of a personal interest, I do not know a single owner of property in any one of the proposed sites. I suppose we may assume that semi-official communications to the press represent what is going on, and we find that the Federal Government are in frequent communication with the Premier of New South Wales; and that already a number of sites are reserved for inspection by the" huge parliamentary excursion which is shortly to take place, and for which we voted a lot of money last night. I suppose it will be for the purpose of inspecting the sites. We find that the sites already number about 14 or 15. </para>

                    <para>- I only rise to say a few words because I think the thoughts of -some honorable senators : are trending in a wrong direction. The whole of this question -is based on justice. We are going to take the land compulsorily, and we can do it only in accordance with those principles of justice which we each desire to see applied to our own interests. I have had some experience in the matter of taking land compulsorily,and out of that experience I may be able to drop a thought or two which may be worth while considering before the Bill comes here. As solicitor for the Tasmanian Mail Line Rail way Company I was interested in carrying out some 200 awards, taking the various properties or strips of properties from the town of Hobart to Evandale Junction, fifteen miles south of Launceston. I found that the arbitrators, in most cases, carried out the rule which is laid down in all the books on arbitration, that a certain percentage over and above the ordinary market value must, as a matter of right and justice, be given for compulsory sale. If honorable senators will refer to these: books they will find -I am only speaking from, memory, and it is 20 odd years since that line started - that not only 10 per cent, but from. 10 per cent, up to 25 per cent is added to the market value of the land for compulsory sale. They will see in a moment that it would be a fatal blunder for a resolution or indeed for an Act to lay down any hard and fast rule or to try and put limits.Every case must stand by itself. The cases in connexion with : the Tasmanian Main Line Railway were innumerable. The line went through the backyard of a cottage; it went through the garden of a country residence; it went through an agricultural farm and did no harm ; it went through another agricultural farm creating damage by -severance to a considerable extent ; it went through lots of pastoral properties, in most cases doing no harm, in one. or two cases cutting off the woolshed and the buildings from other parts of the homestead ; and in some cases, though very few, it really did take and to some extent damage a country residence or the residence of a town man in the country on which he placed considerable value. Every case must stand on its own bottom, and all that the Bill can do is to lay down the basis or the principle on which compensation must be determined. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is always actuated by common sense, and the Bill authorizing the construction of the line did that. I recollect that my brother, the late ' Chief Justice of Tasmania, when he was Attorney-General, . put in a clause that in every case the arbitrators should take into their consideration the enhanced value of the rest of the -property by the construction of the railway. I am willing to admit at once that simply taking so many square miles of territory is considerably different from running a railway through a strip of property, because we shall take the whole of a 'man's property and the whole of the property for miles around, but still I think we shall find that some of the principles will apply. For instance, suppose at Bombala we take a man's residence on which he places some great store,andwhich, perhaps, is his only property there, we shall have to pay the market value, with so much added for compulsory sale. But if a gentleman has a residence as part of an enormous tract of territory, some of which is not taken by the Commonwealth, and the rest of which is, greatly benefited by the fact that it has taken some of his property for the capital, then a clause, which I hope the Minister will put in the Bill,willbe considered. That is tosay,if he has any other property there which the </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend is evidently more radical than I expected him to be upon this matter, because the radical party have always advocated taxation upon the unimproved value of land. Suppose we take the case of the State with which I am best acquainted in respect to this subject. You there have two different bases of taxation - one municipal, in which the taxation is based upon the improved value of the property ; the other State taxation, in which it is based upon the unimproved value. So that it would be impossible for the motion in this shape to afford any rule of guidance unless we were first to define which basis should be taken, and were secondly to arrive at a conclusion as to which should be the basis for the particular assessments. Then it seems to me that there is. a great and vital defect in the motion. It is this : I doubt whether the Senate would be prepared to abdicate its functions by saying now what the basis of valuation should be upon which we should endeavour to acquire land for the federal capital. I am not familiar enough with the New South Wales conditions to enable me to say whether the basis of State taxation or the basis of municipal taxation in that State - whichever it is to be - is of such a character as I could commend. How can we attempt to do justice by fixing a hard and fast basis of valuation unless we know what that basis really is, and the principles underlying it? There is no doubt whatever that the honorable senator has adopted a liberal percentage. Ten per cent. is the customary percentage allowed over and above the value of the property taken. No one could ask for more than 10 per cent. </para>

But the rule which is generally applicable to arbitrations of this kind is that 10 per cent. is allowed over and above the actual just and market value of the property; and a very handsome percentage that is. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it should. I have in my mind a number of places of this kind in New Zealand. I spent some four or five months there, and I made it my business to go to different parts of the colony, where I saw some very beautiful places and some very nice little properties, very highly improved by being planted with fruit trees of various kinds and in other ways. These were not freehold properties, but were held on perpetual lease, and the persons who lived on them made their livelihood by growing fruit and vegetables. In the case of such places being required for any purpose whatever by the Commonwealth, the whole circumstances and not merely the value of the land should be taken into account. The fact that a man's means of livelihood is being taken away from him should be considered, and a reasonable amount paid by way of compensation. Many of these places came back to any mind the moment I read this resolution.Speaking broadly about the land being required for the federal capital, I would point out that the case is not similar to that of land being required for railway purposes, where a defined route has to be followed, and where the requirements in the way of resumption are arbitrary, and possibly it would not be necessary to take into account resumptions such as I have just been speaking of . Although I consider the terms of the resolution are reasonable, and that an allowance of 10per cent. for compulsory sale is a fair thing, I would ask Senator McGregor not to press the motion to a division, because I think it would tend to hamper us when we come to deal with the, Bill that will shortly be beforeus. </para>

I know that frequently the assessed value is a . great deal more than 10 per cent. below the real value. </para>

                <para>SenatorPEARCE.- The question of severance can come up in a separate clause in the Bill and as a separate reason or compensation . I contend that as la means of indicating to the people in New South Wales the idea of the Senate, it is necessary that this motion should go to a division. I am sure honorable senators will agree with me that the mass of literature that we are being deluged with from people in New South Wales indicates that land booming is going on there.There is an attempt being made to influence us for the purpose of giving an increased value to certain persons' land - a value that they would never receive by selling under ordinary conditions. If only for the purpose of checking this idea which is growing up in New South Wales, it would be well to put the motion to a division and have an expression of opinion uponit. </para>

All I want to see is that the Commonwealth is not "taken down."If this motion be passed it will be a clear intimation to speculators not to go on - that they are not likely to benefit by their speculations. But, seeing the temper in which the motion has been received, it appears tome that the speculators will consider they have a free hand, and that in the end the Commonwealth Government will have to pay perhaps ten times the value of the land. </para>

                    <para>- I think every one will agree that the proposal carries on the face of it the principles of equity and justice.' But I would ask the honorable senator not to press his motion to a division, simply because we have not sufficient time in which to deal with the subject. I could tell honorable senators many cases which have happened in this State in connexion with the acquisition of land by the State, and in which the State has got the best of the bargain. </para>

                <para>
                    (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - With the permission of the Senate, .1 would like to say a few words in the form of a Ministerial explanation before
                    replies. The honorable senator, in the course of his remarks, said, if I understood him correctly, that he was pleased to know the Government had decided to take over the Northern Territory. I wish to say now that the position with regard to that matter is this : The Government desire to take over the Northern Territory when suitable terms and conditions can be arranged between the Commonwealth and South Australia as to financial and other questions upon which the Government are instituting inquiries. I make that statement in order that there may be no misapprehension.
                </para>
                <para>
                    (South Australia), in reply. - Of course, I take the explanation of
                    as to what is in existence in connexion with any negotiations of that kind. I do not think that any South Australian ever expects that the Commonwealth is going to say - " Hand us over the Northern Territory," without any arrangement being made. I am sure arrangements will be made, and that they will be satisfactory. I just want to assure honorable senators once again, although it may be out of place, that I introduced this motion with the highest motives.
                    said that I introduced it for purpose of having an opportunity of referring to his conduct. I only wish .to show the difference between my conduct and the conduct of the honorable senator. When I introduced this motion, no difference existed at all between us, but when a difference did arise and I took the legitimate opportunity of referring to it,
                    himself stopped ma - a tiling that no senator should do if he had any sense of the fitness of things.
                    was exactly in the same position with respect to a resolution of his, and I would like to ask that gentleman, or any other gentleman, if I got up and used the right I had through spite or anything of that description
                    I want to tell the honorable senator that the paper in which the statement I refer to was published was the
                    of 11th June. The meeting reported was held at Paddington on the 10th June, and if I had said what I thought of the statements in the quotation, the President would have ruled me out of order, because every statement was absolutely untrue.

It does not even propose that they are to give the excess value. It only proposes that they are not to give more than 10 per cent, in excess of the assessed value, and consequently in a. case' such as Senator.Playf ord referred to. where the land was so obviously assessed above its value, the Government would never be so foolish as to give 10 per cent, in addition to the value that was already assessed. </para>

                <para>State at any time, and yet are not willing to pay their fair dues to the State? I do not think we are entitled to consider them for one minute. I hope that after this discussion the Government will see that it is necessary to do something in this direction, and that honorable senators who have expressed their opinions so freely to-day will then be prepared to assist. But the Government can do a great deal even now in preventing speculators from having any opportunity of taking advantage of them in the future, and I hope they will do it. Many other points have been referred to which might be discussed ; but I have no desire to occupy time at greater length, and as such a general wish has been expressed that I should withdraw the motion, I do not want to act against the wish of the majority. I shall expect, from the expression of opinion that has been given to-day, that support will be given to any amendment in the Government Bill in the direction which I have indicated. I ask leave to withdraw the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - When this Bill was last under discussion, I suggested that it would be advisable to arrange for another sub clause which would comprise periodicals published at intervals of more than seven days.

                        <para>- The fixing of the rate is another matter altogether. We have decided as to the method by which rates will be fixed. They will be fixed by the Governor-General in Council and the scale will be laid upon the table for fourteen days, and, if not disapproved of by either House, will become law. It may come into operation at a date to be fixed. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared at the present time to state what would be the rate fixed by the Governor-General in Council. The intention is that it shall be a different rate to that paid by newspapers. I am not prepared to say exactly how it will compare with the rate for newspapers, but my view is that a newspaper, according to the ordinary acceptation of the term, is a periodical, that is, published at intervals not exceeding one week. We have been in the habit of carrying those newspapers at very low rates indeed. Now outside that particular class of publications are a great number that are published at greater intervals than a week, and they are of a very different character. To put them into classes : there are, first, trade circulars - journals that are published monthly in the interests of some particular trade. </para>

For instance, he made reference to religious and philanthropic publications. They are frequently distributed gratuitously, and I would like to know if he contemplates that the same rates shall apply to those publications as to those which are issued for purely money-making purposes. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think we can make any distinction on that account. All philanthropic movements are supported by subscriptions in some form or other, and even a religious movement, looking at it from the secular side, depends to a great extent on contributions, and whether a charge is made for a newspaper or not I think matters very little, seeing that it is probably paid for in some way or other by those who read it or by the persons who are supporting the movement. The difficulty would be that if we were to differentiate between newspapers for which there is no charge, and newspapers for which there is a charge, we should be called upon at once to differentiate between the newspapers as to the amount of the charge, and we should have to cany newspapers published at a penny for less than newspapers published at twopence, which, I think, would soon involve us in an absurdity. </para>

                    <para>- I do not disagree with the definition of a newspaper, nor am I going to say very much about the definition of a periodical which the Postmaster-General has brought in. If these two definitions were accepted a number of publications which are really newspapers in every sense of the word - if the seven days' limit remains - would be disqualified altogether, because then they would not come under the Minister's definition of a periodical or a magazine. </para>

                    <para>- I agree with the arguments which I think have been put very forcibly by my honorable friend who has just resumed his seat. I am not altogether satisfied with the new proposals of the Postmaster-General. It does seem singular that after a lot of deliberation and after the several States of the Commonwealth saw fit to enact a Bill- </para>

                        <para>- I do not care whether it was copied from the British Act or not. The terms taken from the British Act, I venture to say, at least receive consideration before being enacted in the several Legislatures of the States. The point I was about to make was that the several Legislatures of the States have seen fit, as a matter of public policy, to determine that it is desirable to encourage these periodicals. They devised a scheme following possibly on the lines of British legislation to assist this particular class, by providing that literature published within one month should be circulated at newspaper rates and enjoy the privileges attaching to what we know in the strictest sense of the term as newspapers. They determined upon that as a matter of public policy. It happens that a considerable number of the journals which will be seriously affected by this proposed alteration were ardent supporters of federation. They have got federation, and the first things they have to meet under the new Commonwealth conditions are the policy now proposed of sweeping away concessions designed originally with the object of encouraging literature, and the creation of a more restrictive definition to their serious disadvantage. What has taken place is that in various departments of industries, and in various institutions, newspapers have been established. They have been established in connexion with departments of science, the pastoral industry, the agricultural industry, medicine, and engineering, and in connexion with general philanthropy and temperance. These various departments have thought fit to have their own particular journals. By that means they have been able to secure more elaboration and more detail in regard to matters of immediate interest to them than they could hope for from the ordinary daily or weekly newspaper. These journals are representative of the several interests to which they are attached, and they have been promulgated under the encouraging policy of the State. Now it is proposed that that policy of encouragement shall be reversed in one fell swoop. Even contracts which have been entered into under existing legal conditions are not to be observed in this connexion. I hope that while the Postmaster-General does propose to make certain alterations in regard to definitions, that he will at all events preserve to them these advantages even in the. event of the amendment being lost. I believe the journals now coming under the definition of newspapers enjoy certain advantages so far as the railways are concerned. Their reporters travel at something like 50 per cent, below the 'ordinary charge as reporters of newspapers. Their freightage on the railways is also something like a fourth of the ordinary rate. This is, of course, a most important advantage to them. I have one journal in my mind which represents the pastoral interests, and the duty of its reporters is to travel to the various pastoral shows throughout the length and breadth of the land. My honorable and learned friend the Postmaster-General will therefore see that this is a matter of very grave importance. I instance this case, but what I have said in regard to it will apply in regard to journals representing other interests. As a matter of policy this is a violent reversal of the decision of the States which is going to be brought about by the proposals in the Bill, and we should hesitate before adopting it. If the amendment is lost I would urge upon the Postmaster-General at least to bear in mind the other advantages to which I have referred, and likewise to keep in view existing contracts, so that the several interests will not be improperly penalized. </para>

I have discussed the matter fully with them, and have endeavored to show that I thought there ought to be a difference made between periodicals and newspapers. Ultimately, one or two of those who took an active part in the discussion suggested that there should be a sliding scale differentiating between periodicals and newspapers pure and simple.

                        <para>- It was said in such a lawyer-like manner that I could not thoroughly understand it. The honorable and learned senator has told us that the proprietors of some of these literary productions would be disgusted if they were called newspapers. Not one of them wants to be called a newspaper for any other purpose than the purpose of postage. They do not care what they are called so long as they get the advantages of cheap postage, and if those advantages are of benefit to them and also to the general public, then it is our duty to do all we possibly can to make the Bill as liberal as the statutes in the States at the present time. </para>

                        <para>- We have now to consider the advantages to the citizens of the Commonwealth, and that is what I hope we are all here to do. This Bill is to consider their advantages in connexion with postage, and this clause is to consider their advantages in connexion with the postage of literary matter, whether it be newspapers or magazines. To my mind the clause is satisfactory enough. In the States the public have become accustomed to the privileges they possess. They wish to retain their privileges and their advantages, and all we want to do is to alter the terms in the clause from seven days to one calendar month, and if we do that everybody will be satisfied, except the Postmaster-General, who is only one of the public.

                        <para>- I think it is desirable that the committee should perfectly understand -what the amendment means before it goes to a division. I cannot admit that it is any proof that the term of 30 days which has hitherto existed was placed in the statutes on account of the wishes of the people. The mere fact that it is in the statutes does not indicate in any way that it is in accordance with the wishes of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I do .not know the date of the Tasmanian Act. The date of the Queensland Act is 1891. I was in the House at that time, and I am perfectly certain that no thought was given to the term. It was simply taken as a matter of course that the 30 days, as fixed in the British statute, was the best term. But in Great Britain we find that they have come to the conclusion that seven days is a better term. </para>

                        <para>- The reason why it was altered by Great Britain from 30 days to seven days was on account of the abuse which crept in. It was found that a great number of publications, which were not newspapers in the ordinary sense, took advantage of the very low rates of postage which were fixed for the carriage of newspapers. In the States here that evil has been intensified, in consequence of newspapers being carried not only in some cases at a low rate, but in some cases absolutely free. It was the free carriage of newspapers which encouraged the great number of proprietors of magazines, circulars, and so on to have their publications registered as newspapers in order that they might go free. Whatever definition of a newspaper is put in, it is almost impossible for the </para>

                    Sargood that we should wait for the circulation of the Postmaster-General's proposed amendments. All that the honorable and learned gentleman proposes to do is to put periodicals in a separate schedule.

But it goes further than that. In the centre of the clause there is practically foreign matter. My first amendment is to provide that newspapers " shall" register instead of " may" register. Otherwise it appears to me that this register, which may be altered from time to time, will practically cease to be of any use. It must be a complete record of all the publications that claim to be carried as newspapers. I move - </para>

                    <para>- A certain number of words have been cut out of this clause, but there is still a provision in it enabling the Deputy Postmaster-General to remove from the register any publication which contains' seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter. The Deputy Postmaster-General is thus empowered to remove from the register any publication which contains in his opinion seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or obscene matter. It appears to me that by placing this power in the hands of the Deputy Postmaster-General we put him in a position which he ought not to occupy. </para>

                        <para>- But only after the thing is done. It is like putting the cart before the horse. You punish a man first and try him afterwards ; you put him in gaol, for six months, and then you say that if he feels aggrieved he can appeal. That is the position in which this clause would place a man who published a journal which, in the opinion of the Deputy Postmaster-General, contained seditious, blasphemous, indecent, and obscene matter. I have seen a great deal of writing in the daily press recently which by all the recognised canons was purely blasphemous, but if I had appealed to many honorable senators they would have said it was not so. The Ten Commandments' were suspended for the time being, and blasphemy was relegated to the cool shades. If any person publishes seditious writings he should be brought before the courts in the ordinary way, charged with the crime of sedition, and, if found guilty, punished. </para>

                        <para>- It may be rather difficult, and that is one of the reasons why a power of this sort is never exercised except in extreme cases. Though we may not be able to define it, yet it is possible for language to be used of such a nature that we know it is seditious and blasphemous. It is only in such cases that such a power will be used. I hardly believe that the Senate will desire that the Postmaster-General should be bound to keep upon the register a newspaper that is circulating matter of that character. </para>

                        <para>- I think if the honorable senator will consider the matter he will see that it would render the clause almost nugatory. Situated as we are, six States covering such an enormous territory, before the Postmaster-General could be communicated with and exercise his authority the newspaper would be published all over the States. In the same way it may happen that extending the power to a deputy only is limiting it too much, because it is possible that newspapers might be published in some part of a State away from the capital where the deputy is situated. But in nearly every case the principal newspapers of each State are published in the capital. The Deputy Postmaster-General is there and on the spot to find out whether there is anything of an objectionable character in the newspaper. Therefore, with regard to all those newspapers he would be able to prevent any abuse at an early stage, but to confine this power to the Postmaster-General would be to cripple this clause almost completely. The Postmaster-General cannot be exercising supervision over a publication in Western Australia. Before he would know anything about it perhaps many issues of the paper would be circulated. The very least we can do is to give the power to the Deputy Postmaster-General. </para>

Unscrupulous men may get into these positions, and may exercise these great powers in a way we would not desire. Therefore I think it is very advisable that the amendment should be carried, if we are to have any safeguard over the doings of our officers..

                    <para>- I have already indicated what are my views in regard to this portion of the clause. I think it is desirable that the Postmaster-General should not be invested with the power of destroying the whole issue of a newspaper that he might consider came within the provision with regard to sedition and blasphemy. Six issues of a paper might go through the Post-office and be destroyed before the proprietor knew that they had been destroyed, and I think he should have every opportunity of taking the opinion of a justice of the High Court in a manner that I shall indicate directly before the whole issue is destroyed. One issue may be posted and destroyed, and that may be repeated four, five, or six times before the proprietor knows that his newspaper has come within the purview of this provision, and all the time he is responsible to the subscribers for the loss they have sustained in not receiving their newspapers. I have much pleasure in supporting the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I think the Postmaster-General will see that the principle of the amendment is eminently fair. Suppose I wish to register an article worth £100,I shall have to pay 1 per cent. If I am satisfied that the department will exercise every care in delivering my registered article I need not insure. I simply pay the registration fee, and undertake all risks. But if it is my desire that the department shall take the risk of the loss of the registered article by fire, or by theft, or by any other means, then it undertakes to pay the value at which it is insured. I hope that honorable senators will see how unsatisfactory it is to have no insurance against loss when valuable articles are sent through the post-office. </para>

                        <para>- We are not quite in the same position here as they are in Great Britain. An enactment of this kind that would work well in a very closely populated country becomes unworkable in a country so vast as this. We have an enormous number of offices, and in a great many cases they are in the hands of postmasters who are not postal servants. It is very undesirable to increase the amount of responsibility which is thrown on them, and this proposed insurance would, I think, tend in that direction. The system of registering letters and packets works very well. Of course it is not perfection. If there were some system of insurance against loss it would, no doubt, give the public more confidence, but I think results have shown that a registered letter is practically safe. </para>

For what purpose does the department undertake to register an article but to see that it is delivered ? - to exercise greater care. The only advantage now in registering a letter is that the postal authorities can get a very fair idea of where it has gone to. </para>

                        <para>- Does any one mean to claim that, if a person registers an article in the ordinary way and pays 1 per cent, on its value, it will prompt a postal official to steal it? The official already knows that the article is registered, because a blue mark is drawn across the address. When he knows that it contains something of value,, why does he not steal it? He knows just as much about the nature of its contents now as he would then. </para>

                        <para>- I only desire, inasmuch as somebody is responsible now, and the department has very good means of tracing a packet, that in case of fire, by loss or theft or otherwise, it should be responsible to the extent of the amount at which the sender valued the article ; it may be £10 or more. I am quite agreeable that there should be a limit put to the amount, that the postal officials should have power not to take an article which they believe is not of the value put on it. When a man registers a letter and in trusts it to the postal department and is willing to pay a percentage, it should be quite willing to insure him against loss. </para>

It may miscarry either because the sender has made a mistake or because the person to whom it is sent has changed his residence. I have dealt very largely with registered letters in Australia, but I have never known one to go astray by reason pf departmental negligence. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to offer, except that it is unnecessary. If we overload the Bill it will do an injury. Moreover, if we agree to insure a registered letter the rate of 1 per cent, is ridiculously high. I am sure that the department would do it for perhaps a shilling per cent. </para>

                    <para>- Under this clause if a workman put a pound-note in a letter to send to his wife the Postmaster, if he suspected that it contained a valuable document, could register the letter and charge the receiver the registration fee.. That seems to me a rather hard provision. Many thousands of men who are working in the back country are not within three or four days' walk of a post office. A man may have in his pocket a pound-note which he would like to send to his family, and if he encloses it in a letter and intrusts it to a fellow workman to post at the nearest post-office, why should we be called upon to register the letter, and even then get no guarantee of safe carriage? It is at his own risk that he puts the money in the letter. Again, a seaman who is going along the coast in a coaster may be able to send a pound-note from Rockhampton or Western Australia, but under this clause he would have to go ashore to register the letter or run the risk of having it registered for him and a double fee charged. It seems to me a rather hard provision to make. I would suggest to the Postmaster-General that a provision might be made that a man at his own risk could send to the extent of a couple of pounds. ' I do not know why there should be any limit made if a man wants to send £50 through the post-office. </para>

As it stands now it is a Bill to grant and apply a certain sum of money. It states clearly that the grant is made by both Houses, but that it originates in the House of Representatives.- The word " originated " is the word that is used in the Constitution, and I think, therefore, that the Bill as it now stands should be entirely satisfactory. The amendment in the enacting clause has only been transposed. We suggested that the words " for the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives" should be omitted. As the result of the amendment made by the House of Representatives, the preamble will now read - </para>

                    <para>- There is no business, but I ought to explain the position. We sent to the House of Representatives a message which contained in a schedule three requests to make amendments. To two of those requests they agreed. They agreed to the other with a modification, but they did not wait to see if we accepted this modification. They have sent us back the Bill, but they have npt amended it. What they ought to have done, according to the South Australian practice, was to have waited until the two Houses were in accord and then amended the Bill, and then we could have agreed to it as amended. It is a Bill which we cannot amend. We can only suggest amendments. </para>

                    (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - I very much regret that this has occurred, and I hope still ' that some means may be found of getting over the difficulty, because I believe it is of very great importance that the Bill should pass to-day, seeing that we do not meet again until next Wednesday and that the other House has adjourned. This difficulty, of course, clearly arises from 'a misunderstanding with regard to the standing orders under which we are working. The probability is that we take one view of the standing orders, and that another view is taken in another place.

If we have no standing orders, I do not see how we can be blocked from going on by the supposed existence of some standing order. As it appears now the Bill has come back, and no amendments are shown, but there is a covering letter in which it is stated under the signature of the Clerk of the House of Representatives that certain amendments have been made. It states that the amendment in the title has been made, and that is signed by the Clerk ; that the amendment which I have described has been made in the enacting clause, and that too is signed by the Clerk ; and that the third amendment also has been made in the Bill. Though those amendments are not exactly shown on the Bill, we have the certificate of the Clerk that they have been made. </para>

The House of Representatives ought not, it appears to me, to have made any amendments in the Bill until the two Houses were in accord. How can they know until we have decided the question whether we agree to the modification which they ask us to make in our second suggestion. That ought to be the practice. If we adopt any other practice we shall get into all kinds of difficulties. "We make a suggestion. They may say - " We want a modification of that suggestion." Why should they assume that we are going to agree to that modification ? </para>

                        <para>- What Clerk? The House of Representatives must amend it. No doubt this is a new procedure to the Clerk of the House of Representatives and to most of us. If we look at the theory we must come to this conclusion, that until the two Houses are in accord as to suggestions and to modifications of suggestions, the House of Representatives ought not to make an amendment. Supposing we had not agreed to the modification, what would be the position ? </para>

                        <para>- I presume that if we could in any way arrange to meet at an early period it certainly would be a great advantage. AVe have a sessional order, and unless the Senate otherwise directs, we cannot meet until Wednesday. Whether at this time we could by consent agree to meet on an earlier day I am not prepared to say. If it could be done, I think it would be exceedingly advisable ; in fact, 1 should be almost inclined to suggest that we should meet on Monday or Tuesday. It is too late now to say to-morrow, because the other House could not possibly meet tomorrow, as it has adjourned. If you, sir, rule that the objection is absolutely fatal- </para>
