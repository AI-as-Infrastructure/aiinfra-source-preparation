                <para>Do you see the indorsements on the printed petition ? - I am satisfied that the indorsements are correct. </para>
                <para>When was the petition left with you? - On the 23rd of May of the present year. </para>
                <para>Was anything said about a member ? - I beg pardon, I am glad bo be reminded. When I mentioned about the common law being for a member bo present the petition, they said, bo the best of my recollection -" Oh, yes, we have thought of that, and we have a member in our eye." Then they asked - " Would there be any difficulty in getting the petition from you ?" I said , "No,I shall lock it up, and I shall bake it down to the chamber every day, and put it in my drawer of the table, and as soon as a member comes up bo me and says that he has undertaken to present it, I shall hand it to him." I said - " Until some one comes up to me for the petition, it will go back to my office each day." That is the extent of what passed between us. </para>
                <para>
                <para>You were speaking unofficially ? - With regard to taking the petition down, you may take that as official or unofficial as you like. It was simply saying what I should do. </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>You told the gentlemen who waited upon you that you would bake the petition and keep it in your drawer from day to day until such time as some member would call upon you for it? - Yes. </para>
                    <para>Did you do that?- Yes. </para>
                    <para>How long did you have the petition before any member called upon you for it? - I could not tell you exactly the number of days, but some two or three days - at least three days I think - before it was presented. Speaking from memory, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, through his secretary, asked me if I would allow him to see the petition, and, of course, I did ; and they had the petition in their custody until it was presented. </para>
                    <para>That was about three days' after you received it ? - No ; I should say not more than three days before it was presented. It did not return to me until it was presented. </para>
                    <para>The Vice-President of the Executive Council, through his secretary, got the petition from you, and, I presume, he held it for several days ? - I would not say how many days. I doubt if it was more than three days. </para>

                        <para>- There is another element which I think should not be overlooked. There is the contention that the Senate is the court, and that there should be no limit to the time within which a petition may be presented. If that contention holds good, what is the position of honorable senators ? A petition may be lodged against any honorable senator to-day, to-morrow, next year, or at any time during the term for which he has been elected. Are honorable senators prepared to take up that position, and contend that there should be no time limit for the presentation of a petition. I, for one, decline to do so. I know of no law which one may violate, and with respect to which there is no rule laid down, fixing a limit of time within which a prosecution for such violation shall take place. I am sure honorable senators will see that to adhere to the doctrine that there shall be no time limit in the case of the presentation of the petition against a member of the Senate would be most dangerous. </para>

What undoubtedly was the original position was that the law of Western Australia did apply, that the petition was presented within forty days, and that therefore the law was complied with, but that it had not been sent on. within ten days. </para>

                        <para>- Either there is an absolute rule, and if there is, it was not complied with ; or there is not an absolute rule, and then it is a question of negligence. Whether the petitioner assumed that he had to act under the law of his own State of Western Australia, or under the law of the State in which the Senate was meeting, Victoria, the lodging the petition with the Clerk was equivalent to its presentation to the Senate, and the rest was a matter of course, a perfunctory act. </para>

As I have said so far as my own opinion is concerned, I hold that the Act and practice of Western Australia have no application whatever. The committee never said so for a moment. But .there was no practice and no procedure. The Senate might have adopted- and I venture to think it was the duty of the Vice-President of the .Executive Council when lie moved in this matter to have formulated - sessional orders governing the limitation of time within which petitions should be presented, and the procedure that should have been adopted. That has been done in every instance with which I arn acquainted </para>

There was a conversation of that sort, and during the conversation one of the persons happened to mention that, if the petition had to be presented, they had some one in their eye who would be able to present it. What if they had? I say it does not matter. Is there anything in the whole of that evidence which affects in any single degree the right of this person to have his petition considered by the Senate ? There is no law, as. the Senate has decided already, which prevents that being done. </para>

                        <para>- The Clerk told the petitioner that in some cases these petitions were to be presented, but he was doubtful whether the law of Western Australia applied or did not. The whole matter was left in a state of doubt and uncertainty, and what is there in that which would deprive the petitioner of the right of having his petition considered if he had that right before ? If we say that the law of Western. Australia is to be applied, that is a different matter, but it is admitted that the law of Western Australia cannot be applied unless upon the ridiculous assumption that because the petitioner has adopted it, we should therefore apply it against him. In what other way does it deprive him of the right which he has to have this petition decided by the Senate? Now, let me state as concisely as possible what, in my view, the right of the petitioner is. Under the Constitution, this Senate is the court by which these petitions are to be tried. From the very nature of things, no procedure could be laid down, or has been laid down, for the trial of these petitions. The Senate, therefore, is the court to try these petitions, unhampered by any procedure of any kind whatever. </para>

                        <para>- We have expressed ourselves very freely as to the procedure under the law which applies to the petition. The whole case hinges so much on the procedure that we could not possibly- get away from the remarks we have made in the Senate and the votes we have given. In the last debate on this question, there was some doubt as to whether the petitioner had received a fair deal in bringing the petition before the Senate. There seemed to be some question as to whether the officials had done their duty ; whether it was the President or the Vice-President of the Executive Council who should have presented the petition. But, with the evidence of the Clerk in our possession, there need be no further doubt about the matter. The petitioner made it clear, when he presented the petition to the Clerk, that he intended to go on, and according to the law of Western Australia, he knew perfectly well the way to go on with his petition, and his very failure to proceed after having said that he was going to proceed in a certain direction proves that the neglect rested solely and wholly with himself. I ask the attention of honorable senators to the following passage from the evidence of the Clerk :- </para>

                    <para>When I mentioned about the common law being for a member to present the petition, they said, to the best of my recollection - " Oh, 3'es, we have thought of that, and we have a member in our eye." Then they asked - "Would there be any difficulty in getting the petition from you ?" I said - "ITo, I shall lock it up, and I shall take it down to the chamber every day, and put it in my drawer of the table, and as soon as a member comes up to me and says that he has undertaken to present it, I shall hand it to him." I said - " Until some one comes up to me for the petition, it will go back to my office each day." That is the extent of what happened between us. </para>

                        <para>- We are going to adopt the law of Western Australia that there should be security for costs, and that the petition should be lodged with the Clerk. Then we have to look at the law of the Commonwealth itself as contained in the Constitution. It is nonsense to say that the whole of the Western Australian law must be complied with because that law requires the Legislature to send a petition to the court. That process has no application to our procedure whatever. The Legislature in Western Australia might have found that the £50 deposit was made by a cheque which was dishonoured by the bank, or might have had various other grounds to justify it in not referring the petition to the court. But here the Senate itself is the court, and the petitioner presented his petition to our Clerk together with the necessary deposit. The whole ground upon which the further report of the committee is justified is that our Clerk has testified what we all knew all along. </para>

                        <para>- Surely we all knew that the petition had been presented and that the £50 had been deposited. If honorable senators are allowed to take that point, then I will say - what precious fools the members of the Senate made of themselves by discussing this matter for hours some weeks ago ! Every one knows there are some things of which we have to take judicial cognisance. There are certain things of which a judge takes judicial cognisance. When we have a Clerk and documents are left with him to be dealt with in a way to be determined afterwards, we are bound to take judicial notice of the fact that those documents are in his custody. Then is it not ungracious, ungenerous, and unjust not to take into consideration also the fact that no machinery whatever was formulated under which the Senate could hear petitions of this kind in its own fashion. We have not had time to devise our machinery for dealing with election petitions, and yet honorable senators are not willing to make allowances for the petitioner, who could not have known exactly what machinery he had to comply with. I think that if petitioner is refused the justice he asks for, we shall be doing a very grave injustice to him, and shall be putting the Senate in a humiliating position on the first occasion when wo are asked to perform a judicial act. </para>

W e have no more to do with the law of Western Australia than we have to do with the law of South Australia or Victoria. The only law that we have to consider in this connexion is section 47 of the Constitution, which deals with disputed elections. The preceding section does not affect the question now before the Senate. That has to do with the election of a member under the laws of a State, unless in the meantime the Senate has taken certain measures. </para>

                        <para>- We both want to see justice done. The petitioner has adopted, rightly or wrongly, a certain procedure which in my opinion does not affect the case in the slightest degree. The Senate has decided that the petition should be received, and has forwarded it to the committee. The committee is hopelessly divided, and cannot come to any decision. A most unfortunate delay has taken place, entailing very heavy costs and loss of time upon both parties. Western Australia has lost the services of a valuable representative during all this time, while the Senate itself has been deprived of the services of a valuable member. Seeing that this delay has not arisen from any fault on the part of either the sitting member or of the petitioner, but has been due rather to the want of action on the part of the Senate itself, it is hard that the parties should alone have to suffer. The question is, What is to be done ? It appears to me that it would be useless to remit the matter to the present committee. On the other hand, it would be a very serious thing to adopt the proposal submitted by the leader of the Senate and practically discharge the committee. I certainly have never known of a case of that kind in my experience. The difficulty would be overcome if the members of the committee could see their way clear to resign and leave the matter open to the President to take what action he might think fit in the circumstances. I should hesitate a great deal before taking such a stringent and novel action as that recommended by the leader of the Senate. I should rather see the matter delayed a little longer before we are asked to vote upon such a strong proposal. </para>

                        <para>- My sympathy and vote would, as a rule, go together, but I recognise that there is such a thing as justice to be done to the other side. A man has a right to petition against the holding of a seat by any senator, and it would be a very serious thing to deny the right, even if the petitioner has delayed in taking action or followed the wrong procedure owing to some misunderstanding. As a matter of fact, I think the whole procedure was wrong from beginning to end, .and that the petitioner need have paid no attention whatever to the Western Australian Act. Since I looked into the matter I have always thought so. Still he did adopt a certain course, and the committee are under the impression that because he adopted that course only to a certain extent he is therefore to be put out of court. I cannot go so far as that. If it comes to a division to-day I shall be compelled to vote for the amendment, but I would very much rather not be called upon to pass what I think would be to a certain extent a slight upon the committee. Under the circumstances, if I were a member of the committee I should unhesitatingly resign. </para>

                        <para>- I have always grave doubts until my mind is made up. I think every honest man should. 'I try to see both sides if I can. I may be wrong, and perhaps I am wrong now, but I do not claim infallibility. I believe that this petition should have been presented by a member of the Senate, because I hold that if the Government take up a matter of this kind, it is only a question of pushing the wedge home, in order to get rid of a number of honorable senators. I have seen that kind of thing done in times past. I therefore hold that the Government should be the last to take up a position of this kind, and it cannot be denied that there are members of the Senate who would have presented the petition. In my humble opinion the petitioner had just about made up his mind to abandon the thing. That is how it struck me then, and strikes me now. </para>

                        <para>- A new trial would take place in regard to the petition, and justice, if it be possible to mete out justice in this particular case, would be given to either side. The difficulty I have is that I do not desire to pass a vote of censure upon the committee, and I do not by my vote wish to take a course unknown in the annals of our parliamentary history. Under the circumstances it would be a good thing if the debate were adjourned for a few days or a week in order to allow the committee themselves to take a certain course. If the committee did not feel it is their duty to do so, I should be prepared to vote in the way I think right in the matter. I hold that there should be an inquiry into the merits of the case. I hold that strongly, and if to-day I have to record my vote it will be in that direction. The whole thing is unfortunate, and I believe that if the course I suggested were taken, and a new committee was formed on the nomination of the President, there is no reason to doubt that the new committee would approach the case in a judicial frame of mind, and do justice to both parties. If in the present circumstances I am compelled to give a vote to-day, it must be in the direction suggested by the leader of the Senate, in order that we may have a new committee to hear the petition on its merits. Since we came to the last decision on this question I hold that the committee have not given the matter the consideration which they should have given it. That, of course, is a matter of opinion, and honorable senators have the right to differ with me as to that. I repeat that I think it would be a good thing to adjourn the matter for a day or two, in order to see if we could not discover some way out of the difficulty the </para>

                    <para>. - There are only two comparatively unimportant points on which the Senate is not in accordance with the other House. When the Bill came back from that House, it was accompanied by a schedule of 104 amendments. We disagreed with seven of those amendments and agreed to a number of others with consequential amendments. The other House has given way in the case of six of the amendments on which we disagreed, and has taken exception to our consequential amendments in only one case. I would not like to say that either of the two points of difference between the Houses is in itself unimportant, but I think as compared with the great importance of the Bill they sink into insignificance. It is exceedingly desirable that the Bill should be passed. The date which is fixed for the Bill to come into operation is the 1st of December, and there is a general feeling throughout Australia that as soon as possible uniform regulations should come into operation. I desire to have regulations ready to be tabled immediately the Bill becomes law. It is also desirable that a Bating Bill should be introduced dealing with newspaper postage and telegraphic rates, and I hope to be able to bring it forward during the present season. For all these reasons, it is very desirable that we should come to an arrangement with the other House, and seeing that it has met us very fairly, it is not unreasonable that we should yield to them in the two matters which are outstanding. There are only two, because the three amendments are substantially the same. The question is whether the word " seditious" shall remain. The objection which has been taken in the other House to it is that sedition is a thing which it is impossible to define. </para>

                        <para>- It is a difficulty almost amounting to an impossibility, and their contention has been that it is not desirable that there should be a power to interfere in any way with correspondence on the ground that it contains matter which could come under a word, the definition of which is so difficult, if not impossible. The offence can be dealt with in another way. My sympathy goes always in the direction of maintaining the utmost secrecy with regard to correspondence. My inclination is to preserve everything passing through the Post office inviolate as far as that can possibly be done. I should prefer that the Postmaster-General should not be charged with the duty of stopping any correspondence on such grounds. I move - </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator does not seem to realize what his protest or objection means. The other House have met us in the most friendly way by accepting over 100 of our amendments without any question whatever. If the honorable senator had been present when our second message went down, he would have seen that we were met in the most friendly manner by the other Chamber. Are we going to hang up this Bill because certain senators think that there are existing in the Commonwealth certain dangerous persons who are likely to disseminate sedition ? I have been amongst crowds of people in all parts of the Commonwealth, and I think that we are a very law-abiding community. The position taken up elsewhere is, that these offences, if committed, may be dealt with under the State Acts. Furthermore, the other Chamber is of opinion that it is very difficult to define the word "sedition." Such being the case, I think we should give way, and let the measure go through as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Why should it lead to that ? Does not the honorable senator see that the conditions to-day are entirely different from what they were a century ago ? At the beginning of the last century only a very limited number of people possessed the franchise. If they wanted any change in the Government the only way they could obtain it was by violence. It is perfectly well known that if the Duke of Wellington had not backed down in 1832 there would have been violence. The people of England were quite prepared for rebellion at that time, and if the Duke had persisted in refusing the franchise there certainly would have been bloodshed. We stand in a different position to-day. The people have the power in their own hands. Every man possesses the franchise. When the ballot is in the possession of every citizen there is no reason to resort to the bullet. There is not the slightest idea that anyone in Australia is going to advocate the use of force to bring about any particular change in our political system. If any one does, he offends against the laws of the country, and if he can be tried under the common law, there is no need to make this postal measure a special vehicle for legislation on the subject. I shall certainly support the Postmaster-General in the attitude which he has taken, up. </para>

The clause itself seems to be aimed at authorizing the Postmaster-General to remove from the register any newspapers which offend against the law. The offences against the law prescribed in this Bill are sedition, blasphemy, indecency, or obscenity. </para>

                        <para>- It is somewhat difficult to distinguish between the two ; but we generally understand public policy to be this : - By the laws of civilization, both written and unwritten, there are certain things which every reasonable-minded person objects to. Any one of these is said to be contrary to public policy. It is entirely contrary to public policy that a newspaper should be allowed to remain on the public register which could be dealt with in a court as being contrary to the law. If the matter complained of is not contrary to the law, then it is not seditious, and the newspaper will remain on the register. If it is contrary to the law, and capable of being dealt with in the courts, then the newspaper should not be allowed to remain on the register. </para>

                        <para>- The answer to that is obvious. The Postmaster-General, in carrying out the provisions of this measure, has to do a great deal at his own risk. If he removed a newspaper from the register on the ground that it contained not merely seditious but offensive or indecent matter, and action were taken with the result that it was proved that it did not contain that matter, then this measure would be no answer by the Postmaster-General for his action. I have nothing further to urge. It certainly does seem to be somewhat extraordinary that this exception should be asked for in the case of seditious language. What is the difference between that class of offence and the other evils that we deal with in the clause, that it should have this exemption ? </para>

In defence of the British flag I probably have done as much as and would do more than the honorable senator ; but what I want to point out is that the greatest patriots Britain ever had were those who had the courage to point out her faults and mistakes. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator had lived in the days of King William, I suppose he would have hanged him. They were all seditious in their turn, but they came out on top, and of course they were great men. That is the reason why I think we should not further delay an important measure of this description by going into the particular phases of loyalty or disloyalty which may be involved in such a term as seditious. It depends upon the administration of the department at the time, and upon the administration of justice afterwards. One honorable senator sitting as a judge in the case of a certain expression might declare it seditious, while another might declare that it was not. The history of Great Britain has furnished hundreds of examples where, even in connexion with the administration of the law, party prejudice has led people astray. I hope that, in the interests of the country, nothing will occur to retard the passage of this Bill. We have ample opportunity in the Commonwealth or in the different States to pass laws to deal with those who act against the interests of their country, and we should not introduce our party inclinations or feelings in the discussion of this measure. I hope the Bill will be carried in the way in which it left the House of Representatives, and that it will become law as expeditiously as possible. </para>

                    <para>- This is by no means a new question. Wo are aware that certain honorable senators were opposed to the inclusion of the words " seditious " and " blasphemous " in the Bill, but the Senate determined to insert those' particular words, and at the instance of Ministers. Clause 27 was debated at considerable length, and amendments were made in it, but the words " seditious " and " blasphemous " were left in by the Senate. The other House struck those words out, and when the Senate was called upon to consider the matter again, we met the other House by omitting the word "blasphemous," and retaining the word " seditious." Now the Senate is asked to say that the matter is so little worthy of consideration that it is prepared to back down at the request of members of the House of Representatives. </para>

It has been said that " seditious " is hard of definition. We have heard a definition of it, and honorable senators must bear in mind that the matter will be entirely in the discretion of the Postmaster-General. He will not be compelled, because of a legal definition, to say that a paper shall not be permitted to go through the post-office. We may assume that the discretion will be exercised wisely, and that it will not be merely for a technicality that a newspaper will be interfered with.

                    <para>- The next amendment of the Senate to which the House of Representatives has disagreed requires a little explanation. It will be noticed that two amendments in the clause were rendered necessary by the omission of the words "seditious blasphemous," in the other House. The Senate proposed to re-insert the word " seditious," but in order to make the sub-clause read grammatically, it became necessary to insert the words " if such issue contains," before that word. The two amendments hang together. If our amendment to which the other House objects is insisted upon, then of course we insist upon the consequential and grammatical amendment. I feel myself obliged to ask the committee not to insist on the amendments. I regret the result of the division on the lost amendment, because I think it is calculated to hamper the passage of the Bill. Perhaps I should have explained before, that the Bill has made three passages backwards and forwards, and that according to our standing orders our power of dealing with the matter by means of messages will be exhausted on this occasion. If we insist upon disagreeing with the other House, it will be necessary to ask for a conference. I think that the importance of getting the Bill into operation is so very great that it far transcends-- </para>

                    <para>- I accept your ruling, sir, , but I would point out that we are asked to undo by a side-wind, what we did at an earlier hour. It is perfectly certain that had the committee not insisted upon retaining the word " seditious " in the first part of the clause, it would willingly have accepted this amendment as being consequential. I ask the representatives of the Government whether it is fair, having ascertained the opinion of honorable senators, to attempt now to get the decision of the Senate reversed. Some honorable members who voted previously may now be absent. There were 28 votes recorded, and the probability is that if another division is taken there will be fewer votes recorded. If the same senators are present I have no doubt that the division will be precisely the same as the last one, because the principle is exactly the same. I can not conceive that any honorable senator would be prepared to stultify himself by voting in one way at half-past six o'clock and in another way at 8 o'clock. We are asked to stultify the decision we arrived at this evening, and to make the clause absolutely inconsistent. The Senate has to be guided by its own sense of what is right and what is wrong. We have had this question under discussion on four or five occasions, and we have invariably come to the one conclusion. Is it consonant with the dignity of the Senate or with the representatives of the Government that they should say - " We disapproved of the decision given, but we may by a chance vote reverse it and make the clause inconsistent." Is it reasonable to adopt a course like that? I submit that it is not. The Postmaster-General has said that the other House have conceded a great many points to us. </para>

                    <para>- I do not know why the Government should be asked to study the wishes of the fourteen honorable senators who voted for the retention of the word " seditious," rather than the wishes of those who voted for its elimination. Those who were in favour of the amendment made by the House of Representatives are entitled to just as much consideration as. those who voted against the acceptance of the amendment, especially considering that those who voted against the amendment were not a majority. Had there been a full House I feel sure that the majority would have been in favour of the amendment of the House of Representatives. I think it can also be said that the question now before the Chair is not on all fours with that on which the committee previously voted. If honorable senators will turn to the Bill they will find that the question wc dealt with before the dinner adjournment was that of removing from tho register newspapers containing seditious, blasphemous, indecent, or ' obscene matter. But this is a question whether the Postmaster-General shall have power to refuse to transmit such newspapers. Under subclause 4, the question is whether the postal authorities will have power to destroy them. It has been urged in favour of this provision that the newspaper proprietor has power to appeal to a Judge. But if the circulation of his paper is stopped, and the copies of the issue have been destroyed, the matter is already judged so far as his property is concerned. Therefore, the question now raised is a different one than whether the Postmaster-General shall have power to remove the name from the register, because that action in itself does not inflict any irreparable injury, inasmuch as the proprietor can proceed to get an injunction to have his. name registered. In any case, his property is not destroyed, and the circulation of his. paper is not interfered with. Therefore, it can fairly be said that this provision, raises a different question to that raised in. the preceding sub-clause. The fact that some honorable senators who voted in the previous division are now absent is one for which no blame can be laid upon the shoulders pf the Government. It is the business of honorable senators to be here to deal with matters as they arise. I hope that the Postmaster-General will insist upon this amendment, if only in justice to those who supported the Government on the previous question. </para>

                        <para>- I will leave the committee to judge of the correctness of that statement. I hope the committee will not allow the passing of the measure to be frustrated by what is a party move on the part of the honorable and learned senator. I have no hesitation in saying that although this particular amendment involves probably the same question as the amendment dealt with previously, the last division was taken at a time when honorable senators did not thoroughly realize the position in which the question stands. I am quite certain that many honorable senators who voted in that division would have recorded their votes differently if they had realized the true position. At all events the subject is of such importance in regard to the carrying of this measure that I feel justified in asking the committee to reconsider it. It is not a mere matter of whether this or that is or is not inconsistent. The position of the Government is that we shall fight this question on every occasion when we can possibly do so. We shall fight it now and upon the next amendment, and I hope we shall be successful in reversing the decision which the committee have already come to, and which, I fear, was arrived at without really proper consideration as to the consequences which that vote involved. What is it we are talking about? I could well understand that, if it were a matter of vital importance to the administration of the measure, we might insist upon the clause as it left the Senate being retained so far as this particular provision in it is concerned. But what does it amount to? We have given over to the administrators of this postal measure a large number of powers. Amongst them we have given them the power which involves a decision by one man, an official, of a question which it is exceedingly difficult to decide. That is, whether a particular statement is or is not seditious. I am free to admit that there are many statements about which there can be no doubt whatever, and which the Government ought not to allow to be disseminated through the post. On the other hand, there area great many statements and exhortations to action which may be highly disapproved of by the Government of the day, but which are not seditious. What more dangerous weapon could we put into the hands of the Government of the day than the power to stop, through the post-office, the publication of some particular doctrine ? Then the newspaper proprietor has an appeal to the court, which, however, cannot be expected to decide the question on the grounds of principle, but will simply look at it from the point of view of the hard-and-fast, cast-iron rule laid down by Judges in the definition of what is seditious. We are, therefore, face to face with the question of whether, after all, it is a wise thing to hand over that power to any one man. I can understand that power being given in regard to publications that are obscene or indecent. That is a matter of judgment not involving political feeling or party considerations. But the publication as to which the question of sedition is raised may be one which simply contains a condemnation of particular views. Therefore, I have no hesitation in saying that, although this is a Government measure, I feel quite satisfied on a consideration of the matter that the inclusion of a clause of this kind in a Postal Bill is a mistake. Do not we all know that in the history of the empire, in the history of England, and of Ireland, and of Scotland, there are numerous cases of men having been arrested and imprisoned for making speeches which would be within the ordinary rule of political controversy at the present day. </para>

                        <para>- Licence may be an abusive epithet, but that does not help us to settle the question. What one person might call licence, another would call liberty. I am speaking of the substance of the matter - I do not care what we call it - and the tendency is to give more perfect freedom of speech. Where freedom of speech is such that it obviously outrages the system of government itself, there are abundant opportunities for bringing the culprit to justice through the ordinary process of the law. This proposal does not take away the right to prosecute for seditious libel, nor to deal with an offender in any way which the criminal law will permit. The person so charged may be brought before the court, and have his case tried in a proper way, with a jury to decide whether he has been guilty of sedition or not. This puts the power of appeal ultimately, however, in the hands of a Judge, who has to decide as a naked question of law whether the particular publication is seditious or not. </para>

It would involve constitutional questions as to procedure and practice, and all simply because the Senate insisted upon retaining something which ought not to have been in the Bill originally.

In any event, the proceedings would be protracted if the committee adhered to its determination. I ask the committee to assent to my honorable and learned colleague's proposition, and to take steps to make the Bill law in the shortest time possible. </para>

                        <para>-The honorable senator told us that probably these words were copied from some previous Act. I am quite sure they were, because the words "seditious," "blasphemous," "obscene," and " indecent " are always used together as exhaustive of the offences which papers can commit. Why should we in this case depart from the ordinary rule, and adopt words which are not exhaustive ? It has been said that this will give the Postmaster-General a monstrous power, but by sub-clause (5) there is an appeal to a Judge. If there was no appeal there would be some force in the argument which has been used, because it might be said that sedition was a matter which could only be fairly ascertained by a judicial inquiry. We have the judicial inquiry provided for in this case, and the proprietors of newspapers will, therefore, not be dependent on any haphazard decision which a Postmaster-General may give. It has been said that this is a dangerous power because political opinions differ and Governments are always changing, but I am unable to see any connexion between politics and sedition. Sedition is creating disaffection or discontent by some unlawful means, entirely irrespective of whether a free-trade or a protectionist Government is in power. No one could put this view more strongly than did the Vice-President of the Executive Council when the measure was introduced. But it has pleased the Government in another House to entirely forget the Senate, and for certain political purposes to allow the elimination of this word. They wish to force upon us the conclusion they have come to on account of political exigencies, and they justify the course they have taken by the most flimsy arguments I have ever heard put forward by any person priding himself upon logical reasoning. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator has stated that the Ministry has seen fit to turn a somersault for political reasons. He undoubtedly made this a party question when he used those words. He meant that the Government had found it necessary in order to hold office to placate certain members in another place by accepting their amendment. If there is any party feeling in the matter at all, I imagine that it comes from those honorable senators who are anxious to see a change of Government. The Government have at their disposal a great many lucrative positions, and no doubt these honorable senators think that if they were in office they could fill those positions with a great deal more credit to the country, and probably profit to their friends. I appeal to impartial senators who are anxious to see the business of the country done, whether,, although they may object to the word, "seditious" being struck out, it is worth while to insist upon its retention on account of the danger which threatens the Bill. </para>

                    <para>- If I had been here when the last division was taken I should have voted with the Government, and practically reversed the vote I gave on a previous occasion, on the ground that I was never very strong in favour of the retention of the word " seditious," but only thought that it might be advisable to give the Minister power to restrict the circulation of certain publications.. The other House agreed to our amendment in one respect, but it refused to go the whole way. We then asked the House to&gt; reconsider its decision, but it has decided that the word, if retained, would be injurious to the working of the Post-office, and might cause a great deal of friction-' and a great deal of loss to newspaper proprietors and others. For these reasons it has not seen its way to accede to our request. There is no great principle involved; in the retention of the word. </para>

                        <para>- Owing to the broad meaning which might be placed* upon the word by different persons, according to their temper of mind at the time, it was thought advisable at this period, when we boast of freedom of speech, that it should not be retained. I do not think we should gain anything by continuing the struggle any longer. A time may come when we shall have to insist upon certain things in the interest and for the benefit of the States we represent. As this is not particularly a State matter,, and as it is essential in the interest of the Postal department that this Bill should become law, it would be extremely unwise to wreck the measure by insisting upon, the amendment. If we are. determined to be stubborn without any particular cause, another place will be inclined to be stubborn upon other questions ; and I  how can we justify our votes before the people by maintaining a sort of pigheadedness which has no reason to be urged in; favour of it? </para>

                        <para>- But the Government may try to do so only in one direction, in which they will fail. I am anxious that if they fail to secure consistency in the direction they desire, they shall have sufficient respect for the Senate and our powers of legislation to secure consistency even though they cannot have their own way. That is my concern. I am afraid that the Senate may now strike out this word, and may subsequently fail to undo what we did before dinner, and so leave the Bill in a mutilated condition. </para>

                    <para>- Do I understand that the members of the Government in the Senate are now anxious that we should reverse the decision we arrived at an hour or two ago? If so they cannot reckon on any support from me. I speak very plainly, and I am pained to have to speak in this way, because I was quite prepared, and have been during the 30 years I have been in public life, to give every Government honest support. But when the Senate arrives at an honest decision, the Government should adhere to it, and I strongly object to any attempt to get an advantage over a vote deliberately and fairly taken, especially when the Government are themselves the fathers of the very clause and of the very language we are now seeking to maintain. Politically speaking it is most reprehensible that the Government should turn its back upon itself in that way. </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to create any debate that can be avoided upon this question. We have already had a division, and I have no reason to assume that there would be any chance through the absence of two or three senators or the presence of two or three others to again jump Jim Crow, and reverse the last decision arrived at. I think we may recognise the victory the Government have gained in the last division, and make them a present so far as debate upon this amendment is concerned. We may, however, have another division to show that there are eleven or twelve men who are consistent, and who stick to their principles. </para>

                    <para>- Amendment No. 6 is of a somewhat different character from the others. We disagreed with seven important amendments of the other House, but in this one case it will not give way. It was purely from sentimental reasons that I objected to the amendment. I did not like to see the clause in the Bill, but I can see perfectly clearly that it will not do any harm. I understand that the other House insists upon the provision, because it is considered advisable that in- the case of those States which have legislated on the subject there should be no chance for any confusion as to the correct definition of the words, "indecent or obscene matter." Whatever we may have said in regard to other amendments, no one can contend that there is anything vital in this amendment. </para>

If he believed that he had the support of a majority of the Senate, he would agree to my suggestion. But the Government see that possibly tomorrow they will not only lose the opportunity of making the change they wish to make, but that the Senate may feel inclined to change what has been done to-night. That is not the way to get a deliberate expression of opinion. It is a double-edged sword which will be used against the Government.

                        <para>- My honorable and learned friend is perfectly accurate, but this is no joking matter. Some time ago the committee arrived at a deliberate conclusion. At the instance of the other branch of the Legislature we were asked to reconsider our decision. We did so, and resolved that our decision should stand. Now, without notice, the Postmaster-General asks us to reverse that decision which we have twice affirmed. If the Government succeed in obtaining a reversal of the decision under these circumstances, it will be a most unfortunate and undesirable interference with the ordinary course of business as transacted by British Legislatures. If the South Australian Parliament ever acted under such a provision as this I regard it as a most dangerous one, as most undesirable, and as absolutely at variance with the practice of the House of Commons, and of all other Houses of Legislature throughout the wide dominions of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is right to use such an expression, for the reason that on both these matters each House has had its own opinion, and I have no doubt that honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives hold those opinions still. But we recognise that in politics there is such a thing as compromise. Seeing that the Bill cannot pass until both Houses have come to an agreement upon it, we must recognise that in a case like this, where two Houses take up strongly antagonistic positions one or the other must give way. As I pointed out earlier in the afternoon the House of Representatives in connexion with this Bill have met us with great fairness, and have given way in many matters upon which members of that House held strong convictions. They gave way, not because they surrendered their own views in regard to those matters, but because they recognised that there must be a compromise, and that one House or the other must give way. They had seen before a disposition on the part of the Senate to meet them fairly, and they showed a similar disposition to meet the Senate. I am glad that some members of the Senate were present in the House of Representatives when this Bill was before that House, and they will remember that members of the House of Representatives were not asked " to swallow their convictions" or to " jump Jim Crow " - language of that kind was not used - but they were asked to remember that there was another branch of the legislature which was entitled to be considered. They did that fairly, and though amendment after amendment was brought forward upon which members of the House of Representatives had previously expressed strong opinions, they showed themselves willing to give way in order to meet the Senate. That being so it is right and proper that we should show an equal disposition to meet them. </para>

                        <para>- I presume that the ordinary method of obeying the ruling of the Chairman in such a case, is the method I am going to adopt of withdrawing the words. They would have been withdrawn earlier if the honorable and learned senator had allowed me to go on. I am surprised to hear the Vice-President of the Executive Council express himself as not being super-sensitive, because I do not think the Senate needed any such expression from the honorable and learned senator. He may not have been guilty of disgraceful conduct iri connexion with this Bill, but he will not deny that he has given us throughout the conduct of this Bill through the Chamber a marvellous exhibition of somersaults. The honorable and learned senator is one of the most skilful acrobats I have seen. </para>

                        <para>- I have said all I desire to say with regard to the exhibitions. I wanted to say these few words as a parting shot as this is the last occasion upon which we can have an opportunity of discussing the Bill. I have risen to express my utter dissatisfaction that we should, after a few short hours, be upsetting what was decided in this Chamber, by a larger meeting of members than we have had during any division that has since taken place. I wish to emphasize the fact that in a small House we are now proposing to reverse a decision which was come to by the largest House we have had for many weeks. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators present heard sufficient of the debate, and if the decision is adjourned until to-morrow we shall have a full House, and there will be a larger majority against the Government proposals. Surely the Government is not going to start the Commonwealth with a reputation for getting the Senate to change its votes every two or three hours ? After the division taken at half-past 6 o'clock I left the Senate with the deliberate intention of not returning, because I was engaged elsewhere. I had no conception that a vote taken at half-post 6 o'clock would be reversed again at half-past 10 o'clock by a smaller number of senators. That is unheard-of, and it is not commendable. The public will not like it. The public like honest votes to be taken, and decisions come to without any snatch victory. It will not redound to the credit of any party, whether Opposition or Government supporters, to maintain their position in that way. I hope that even now the Government will see it to be their high duty to postpone this question till to-morrow. If they can then secure a majority, I shall not ask them to reverse that vote, and I shall even support them in such a case if a snatch vote is attempted to be secured against them. As we have already arrived at an honest decision on the question, it is utterly unconstitutional and unusual to force this question to another division at this late hour. </para>

The largest division we have had during all the divisions that have taken place upon these amendments was that in which the side on which I sit was represented by fourteen. So far, in all these later divisions, the Government have not been supported by fourteen senators. </para>
