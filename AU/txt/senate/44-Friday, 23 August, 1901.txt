                <para>This provision, if retained, would entail a very large amount of trouble. The charges on many classes of goods represent a few shillings, and are seldom received until a month, perhaps two months, after the goods have been shipped. Another difficulty is that some markets have no port of export in the country, as for instance the markets in Switzerland. The provision in the clause was drafted a good many years ago, but the course of trade - the mode of buying, paying, and exporting - has considerably altered of late years. Speaking from my own experience, and after consultation with those connected with other branches of the trade, it appears to me that these words must be omitted, because it would be absolutely impossible to carry them out. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I must take exception to the statement of
                    that my amendment is not in accordance with the provision in many of the existing Acts. Packages were not included in some of the Acts for many years. Difficulties arose in consequence of that, and in section 9 of the Victorian Act, No. 1082, a special provision was inserted in order to avoid fraud in connexion with inside packages. I intend later on to move the insertion of a similar provision in this Bill.

                        <para>-Inside the case are goods, in packages, and these up to the passing of that Act were free of duty. There was such a very liberal mode deduction from the cost of these goods for what we called the inside packages that section 9 was passed. I would strongly urge the Minister to insert a similar provision in this Bill. It will not only save a considerable sum to the revenue, but will protect the honest trader. My amendment simply deals with the question of free delivery on board. It may be the practice not to deliver groceries and so on free on board, but that course has never been followed with softgoods, which represent a very large proportion of the imports. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not; more than half the imports are what we call softgoods, and it does not apply to them. On softgoods the transit charges from Manchester, Liverpool, or Birmingham to the port of export amount to only a few shillings. Those charges are not sent in by the railway companies sometimes until a couple of months after the goods have gone, and thus it will be absolutely impossible to carry out this provision. I do not wish to deprive the department of any duty on the contrary, I want to conserve all the duty I can, because I believe that so long as all are placed on the same footing it is better for the honest trader to have every necessary precaution. Unless these words are omitted it will simply open the door to innumerable disputes and constant delay. </para>

Where there is no check, the dishonest trader finds it out, and the revenue, as well as the honest trader suffers. There is a similar provision to this in the New Zealand Act of 1882. It is as follows : - </para>

                    while admitting fairly enough the risk to the revenue, suggests that there ought to be, instead of this provision, one similar to section 9 of the Customs Act of Victoria. I am informed by the Customs officers that there has been a great deal of difficulty in working that section. It is found that the values that are put upon these inside packing cases entirely depend, in many cases, on the way in which the trader wishes to have the value estimated. He makes the value of the inside cases exactly what he likes, and it is very difficult to check him. With all respect to
                    I do not see how section 9 of the Victorian Act, which is found to work badly, can in. any way compare as a solution of the question with the simple method adopted in this Bill and in the Western Australian Act, that the value of the goods free on board shall be taken ; that is to say, the value of the goods including all packing of every kind and the cost of transit to the ship. There can be no difficulty in estimating that. In the Customs Act of Canada, passed in 1886, it is made very clear what the value is to be Section58 provides -

                <para>So that the way they do it in Canada is this : They provide that there shall be added to the value of the goods the cost of inland transportation, and the cost of packing shall not be allowed to be deducted. Therefore the Canadian provisions come to the same thing as this one clause. That is to say, in taking the value of the goods they insist that the value shall be value free on board after all these charges have been paid. The method which is adopted in this Bill puts in a very few phrases precisely the same provision as we find in the Canadian Act, the Western Australian Act, and the New Zealand Act. I think honorable senators will see how very important it is to the revenue, and I hope the clause will be carried as it stands. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I have a house in Western Australia, and can speak by the book. The section in the Western Australian Act, to which
                    has referred, is a constant cause of delay in receiving delivery of goods, and of annoyance between Custom-house officers and the trade. Frequently letters have been sent by our house in Western Australia to the London house, complaining that such and such charges have not been delivered, and the London house cannot give them. It is really an absolute impossibility to give them. With regard to the honorable and learned senator's statement as to the inside casing, he has got hold of the wrong end of the stick altogether. It is because of the evasions which did take place with regard to these inside casings that the goods are charged a certain price including the inside boxes. The 10 per cent,
                    is supposed to cover all the little charges, and it operates perfectly simply, and easily. As a matter of fact, the packages are generally put at the end of a firm's invoices, and the custom used to be to deduct the amount of the packages and pay simply on the exact goods.

What does the Government of the Commonwealth require here but that at some point of transit the value of the goods shall be ascertained ? If the merchant does not know the exact cost of transit from Birmingham or Manchester to London or Liverpool then of course this clause will make him do business in a very much more precise manner than it appeal's from the statement of

                    (South Australia). - I should not like a direct misrepresentation such as has been made by Senator Clemons to go to the public without challenge. He talks about the natural protection of 10 per cent. That would leave the public to believe that there was a 10 per cent. charge made on the value of the goods, while, as a matter of fact,there is only 10 per cent, added to the value of the goods, and then the Customs charges are made On that. If goods worth £100 in value come in, 10 per cent, customs duty would not be charged on them, but the 10 percent, would be added to the £100, making £110, and the customs duty would be charged on that amount. But that is not the idea that SenatorClemons' argument would convey to the public.

                            <para>- The difficulty so far as the Customs are concerned is this : There are endeavours made in all sorts of directions by dishonest traders to evade stating the real value of the goods, and we have to meet that by every possible device. One of the greatest safeguards is to have the original invoice sent by the person who actually supplies the goods. The person who supplies the goods in this case is not the person who supplies this invoice. </para>

There ought to be no call upon the importer in Australia to go beyond his seller in London to get an invoice from' the Continent. It is possible that the shipper of goods from Hamburg which have been sold by an agent in London might not have been the original seller at all, as the goods might have been produced in Vienna, and the first invoice might have been an invoice issued in Vienna. In the interests of fair trading the amendment should be accepted.

There is a case within my knowledge where goods came out to Australia accompanied by three invoices - one to show to a possible customer, one for the importer, and one for the Customs. The person described as the seller here of course knows the exact price he got for the goods, and if we take the invoice of any other person we have les3 assurance that the price of the goods is being honestly stated.

                        (New South Wales).The amendment does not in any way remove the liability of the seller to supply the invoice. Assuming, with the Postmaster-General, that all honesty is centered  in the original seller, and that every man dealing with the goods outside the seller is more or less given to roguery, we would be still in the same position under the. amendment as without it. If the amendment is carried the clause would still provide for the original invoice prepared, and issued by the seller, and the only thing is whether we shall oblige the seller to be on the spot at which he sells his goods. If , while in Melbourne, agree with a butcher in this city to sell him a number of sheep depastured  in New South Wales, must I supply a contract note prepared on the New South Wales run on which the sheep are depastured  ? That is a parallel case, and honorable -senators will see how absurd it is to say that I could not give my invoice for the sheep, because I was not in New South Wales to prepare it. I am as anxious as Ministers to see that there shall be no loop-hole for fraud, but the clause as it stands insists upon an irritating provision which has no compensating advantages.

As between the seller's invoice in London and the German invoice the Customs here have the benefit of the higher invoice, because if there is an intervening profit it will be added to the German invoice, and will be included in the London invoice. </para>

With his head-quarters in London, he acts as middleman for the German firm and for myself. He invariably furnishes me for the Customs of Tasmania with the invoice from that firm to satisfy me that he is acting honestly by me, and as a voucher to enable me to act honestly by the Customs in Tasmania. I admit that my agent is not absolutely independent, but he is practically in the same position as if the German house had an agent in London. He is buyer and agent at the sametime. </para>

He told me what they cost, and asked me to see that on arrival they were properly stored in Sydney. To my great surprise, the Italian house sent me an invoice for the Custom-house separate from the other, showing that one cannot rely on the manufacturer's invoice any more than on the seller's. I would rather trust the manufacturers in Great Britain than the foreign manufacturers to give the proper invoice. In another case, the manufacturer to my surprise sent me out an invoice for the Customs less than the cost I had paid. </para>

                        SYMON (South Australia). - I think every one is desirous, whatever view he takes of revenue matters, to secure that every shilling shall be paid to the Customs. We are equally anxious that.no possible opportunity for the perpetration of fraud or the presentation of salted or discounted invoices shall be permitted, and if I thought that the clause as it stands was essential to carry out those two objects, I should undoubtedly be found supporting it in its entirety. But I cannot come to that conclusion. I listened to the forcible arguments put by
                        and they convince me more firmly than ever that the clause as it stands is an absurdity. It assumes, to begin with, that goods are only sold in the country from which they are exported. That is the underlying assumption. If that were the case, then the clause, although it is perhaps inartistically framed - -if I may say so of a provision in a Bill which is altogether a model of drafting - would be all right. But if that is not so it involves this absurdity : That it compels the seller of goods, who may be the owner of them, selling them in London, to issue his invoice in Germany, where the goods may have happened to be manufactured - a country with which he has nothing to do, and with which his interests come to an end the moment he has completed his purchase of the goods from the manufacturer. If it means that the Customs want to get hold of the manufacturer's invoice that is a perfectly proper thing, because, by a comparison  of that invoice and the London seller's invoice, the Customs might be able to check anything that went wrong or that they might suppose was likely to go wrong. But if a man buys goods in London, either from a person who is agent for the manufacturer in another country or is the owner of the goods himself, there is a difficulty, because a great amount of trade is done in London by persons who sell goods manufactured in other countries, but who never have those goods in their possession. They buy at a certain fixed rate, and re-sell at a profit, but they have nothing but samples to show the purchaser. One Can go into hundreds of houses in London, where in a little room one can be shown collections of samples from all the countries in Europe. The man who has these samples in his possession is as absolutely the seller as if he had the actual goods in his store in the building. It is as plain as possible that it is his invoice the Customs ought to hu ve. lt is the original invoice, and the Customs should not compel that man to issue any invoice in another country. One concrete example in fact is worth any amount of theory, and I have listened to the instance put by
                        with interest. But it does hot convey to me any analogy whatever to the illustration put by
                        Most of us, I dare say, occasionally buy things in London. We buy them through an agent. We simply employ the agent for the purpose of buying the particular articles. Perhaps the agent cannot get them in London and sends to France or Germany for them. He charges us a commission. He is not the seller. If he chose to make out an invoice, it would be an improper one, and one that he ought not to send. Therefore the invoice that ought to be presented to the Custom-house is the invoice the agent gets from the manufacturer in France or Germany. Otherwise, if such agent in London were an agent of the seller, and were in fact and in law the seller, he is presenting a wrong invoice ; because the invoice in Germany ought to have added to it the commission the agent is paid, which is part of the price the customer in Australia pays for the article. But none of us would ever dream of presenting to the Customs the invoice of the manufacturer of the goods in a foreign country, plus the commission paid to the agent. If the agent were the seller, we should be bound to do so. Instead, we send to the Customs the seller's invoice - the invoice from the manufacturer in Germany or elsewhere, and do not pay duty on the invoice of the agent in London. This clause, whatever its aim may be, has not really been understood as it would be by a practical man. The original genuine invoice is the invoice issued by the seller. If the seller is in London his invoice is the true invoice; if he is in Germany, and the man in London is merely the agent, the German invoice is the tine invoice. But whichever it is, when we define it as the original invoice prepared and issued by the seller, we get at everything. The Customs people by their regulations will deal with every tiling necessary, and it will be perfectly easy to close every possible loop-hole for fraud, and to shut out every opportunity for the cooking or salting of invoices which we are all anxious to avoid.

                            <para>- I think I know something about the meaning of this Bill, and I say that the provision I have quoted, and which we have already agreed to, is that the value is to be taken to be the fair market value of the goods. That is to be taken in the usual acceptation of the words. It is not the value in London, but the value in the place from which the goods were exported ; and in order to get at that we want the invoices from the place from which the goods were exported. </para>

                        SARGOOD. _ Suppose a German manufacturer has a branch establishment in London, and he instructs his agent that the price of his goods is so-and-so. The buyer of an Australian firm can go and buy those goods at those prices. The invoices will show the price paid. Moreover, the goods are paid for in London, not in Germany. But
                        says that the Customs will require to see the manufacturer's invoice. I do not hesitate to say that two things will happen. First, the Customs will not get the price the buyer pays for them, because there will be a difference of from 5 to
                        per cent. ; and, secondly, the Customs will get lower duties than would be got if they took the absolute original invoice, which represents the absolute price paid for the goods. I warn
                        that if he seeks to get the manufacturer's invoice he will be opening the door to an immense amount of fraud, such as has happened in the past. In a certain case in Victoria there was a fraud of something like £5,000, simply through the use of manufacturers' invoices.

                        <para>- It is clear that what we want to do is to get at the actual cash value paid by the purchaser for goods in the country from which they are exported. The object is that the duty may be paid upon the actual cash value, and not upon a false value which may be put upon the article in the invoice sent by somebody else. A few years ago a person living in Melbourne, acting as an agent for a person in another State, purchased a certain article, and sent to the person in another State an invoice made out by himself at a very much lower value than the price paid for the article. Clearly that was a fraud. The result was that- although the actual purchaser for whom the article was purchased did not know it - an incorrect invoice was sent to him; and an article of which the price was £26 10s. in actual cash was imported on an invoice for something like £15, duty being paid on the smaller amount. The Customs of the State in question were defrauded of about half the revenue which they should have got. I have studied this clause very carefully, and have been much interested in the debate. The instance I have given is applicable to the case. Suppose I send to a London agent for a certain article, upon which there is a duty of 10 per cent, under a uniform Tariff, and that agent sends me an invoice showing that he has paid £20 instead of £30 for the article. It is a .very difficult thing to find out whether that is a correct invoice or not, unless we allow this clause to remain as it stands, enabling the Customs to get at the original seller's invoice. That is the only object sought to be obtained by the clause, and it would be unwise on the part of the committee to make any alteration in it. This is not an imposition of duty in any way whatever. It is simply a machinery Bill for enabling duties of Customs to be collected. The duties themselves will be imposed later on. </para>

                            <para>- It is in the South Australian Act, and it has been resorted to on more than one occasion with very good effect. A percentage is added to the price stated in the invoice, the man is paid cash for the goods, and the Customs take them and dispose of them - that is, where they believe there is any attempt to defraud. We must depend in these matters upon the work of expert officers, and upon such a provision as I have just referred to, as the only means of stopping fraud, because these invoices are just waste paper. </para>

                        <para>- I must oppose this amendment. Honorable senators will see that " paid or to be paid " means cash or credit. In the case of cash there is no trouble about it and the amendment would not be used ; but we have to deal with cases in which there has been a sale on credit at a certain price, and on the face of the invoice the price is stated at so much, being, a sale on bills having so many months currency. If the amendment were carried it would be open to the importer to deduct from the value of the goods some quantity, which is altogether uncertain, for the terms of credit. </para>

                    (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - We have decided that the invoice is to be the invoice prepared by the seller in the country whence the goods are exported - -that is to say, it is to represent the price paid for the goods in that country. Later on, we say that the price shall be the actual money price paid or to be paid for the goods there. It would be very absurd now to provide for an invoice to be made out by the seller in the country of manufacture, in which the price stated as having been paid or to be paid f or the goods is not to be the price to be paid there, but the price to be paid somewhere else. If we go back to the expression used in clause 149 we find that the value is to be taken to be the fair market value of the goods in the principal markets of the country whence they were exported. What we are discussing now is whether the price stated to have been paid is to be the price paid or to be paid in that country. Surely it must be so.

                        <para>- The Postmaster-General can hardly have seen that this clause seeks to have something done which never will and never can be done, and to pass it under the circumstances is reducing the thing to an absurdity. The clause asks that the invoice shall show the actual money price paid in a country where it never is to be paid and never will be paid, and if it passes as it stands the result will be simply that it will be disregarded, because of the impossibility of carrying it out without reversing the whole course of business as carried on in England and in Europe. </para>

                            <para>-I point out that the "price," and not the " price paid," is what governs the words "in the country whence the same were exported." It does not necessarily mean that the price shall be paid in that country at all. The basis of the whole thing is in clause 149, where the value is taken to be the value of the goods in the principal markets of the country f rom which they are exported. We are dealing now with the genuine invoice, which shows the price paid or to be paid, and it might be more or less than the market value. </para>

There is no question that if that provision is carried out you will get the genuine invoice, and more than that you do not want. But this alternative is the invoice prepared by the consignor, which is a very different thing. If this amendment is made it will cover the whole ground.

One sub-clause deals with goods that are bought and imported, and are the property of the importer ; while the other deals with consignments. The definition of the invoice in paragraph (as) ought to be different from that of the invoice in paragraph (6). But the alternative which
                        suggests is, that some kind of an invoice applicable to one set of goods imported by the owner may .be adopted instead of the invoice by a consignor. I am not sufficiently familiar with the intricacies - or what
                        would call the tricks - of the trade to know what possibilities there are ; but I think it will be very much simpler to keep to one tiling at a time, and not to mix up the definition of an original invoice, for the purpose of an importation of goods belonging to the importer with the definition of an invoice of goods simply consigned for the purpose of sale. Simplicity will be best served if the amendment is withdrawn.

Many consignors send out the original invoices as from the firms from which they buy, and these cases are provided for by my amendment. Other consignors do not send out the original invoice, but an invoice with perhaps 5 per cent, added to it on their own invoice form, and that would be met as it stands. I want to meet both cases, but as it stands it will open the door to fraud.

There may be goods purchased by the buyer here for the purpose of sale or disposal as he pleases, and there may be goods sent here only for the purpose of sale. The clause gives two definitions of original invoices subject to each of these things, and we had better keep them separate. No doubt they have been put in for a good purpose, and there is no need for limitation, because the consignor has a remedy in his own hands.

My amendment is submitted after full consideration of it by the Chamber of Commerce in Sydney. It will place the Government in no worse a position, because we provide not only that the goods shall be assessed, but that the assessment shall be deemed to be the. value of the goods, and whenever the time comes round, if the owner will not pay the duty, the goods will be sold. An owner may wish to keep the goods for some time without the liability of their being sold. They may not be required for home consumption, and ultimately they may have to be re-exported. </para>

                        <para>- I do not see the necessity for the amendment. Is not that what the clause means? A doubt arises when the duty has to be paid ; and I presume it is only when the goods are being removed from bond, and have to pay the duty, that the question arises. When a man puts his goods in bond he enters them either for home consumption or for warehousing. If he enters them for warehousing they can remain in the warehouse for twelve months, but when he wants to take them out there is the question of valuation ; and the third paragraph of the clause is a plain declaration that the value is to be ascertained by the collector. </para>

He is not compelled to pay duty under this clause, because if the goods are re-exported there is no difficulty about the duty, and if the goods are sold in bond, it is only when he wants to withdraw them that he has to pay any duty. 12 n </para>

                        (Tasmania).It occurs to me that the explanation of
                        does not cover the whole ground. Supposing that there is a difference of opinion as to the real value; apparently under this provision the Minister has to sell. Why should npt the importer have the right of appeal ? In other oases if in the opinion of the Minister the goods are undervalued, he forfeits them. Why should not the goods be allowed to go into bond for further inquiry ? There have been cases in which an opinion has been given by the Minister of Customs which was contrary to facts ; but it took some months to ascertain the facts, and, of course, an injury had been done before the inquiry was completed.

                            <para>- Right through this Bill in many places it has been found necessary to give the Minister the power of deciding questions of this sort. Something has to be done or the moment, and what are we to do with the goods while the question is being considered ? There is the question of whether the owner of the goods has been guilty of an evasion of duty. There cannot be an appeal in every case against an executive act of the Minister. It is to be assumed that the Minister will exercise this power with care and a sense of responsibility. It must be remembered that it is not the collector or the officer in charge, or even the comptroller, who has to decide the matter'. It has to go before the Minister. </para>

If a man brings these forms into the Commonwealth there is no doubt he will be liable to the penalty.

If the Minister considers that they will be of any value I do not propose to submit an amendment, but I think they are unnecessary and meaningless. </para>

                            <para>- It is not necessary to make any alteration. There may be some cases in which a person who " sends " these blank invoices will never be within the jurisdiction of our courts, and therefore cannot be punished. On the other hand there may be cases in which a man who is an agent, or traveller or merchant, may go outside of Australia, and actually himself send these invoices, or cause them to be sent, and why should he not be punished ? If for the purpose of punishing him it is necessary to have these words in, the necessity for them is not affected by the fact that they will not be applicable in other cases. I think we had better leave the clause as it is. </para>

Prior to the introduction of this provision I have myself seen cases addressed to our firm, and on the lid of a case being removed there have been found on the top of the goods a lot of blank invoices which we could have done what we liked with. It is not that merchants have asked for them - they have been actually pitched at them. I will agree to move that the penalty be £100, though I think it is not sufficient. </para>

                        <para>- I agree that it is necessary to put some bar upon claims for a refund, but I think there should be some qualification as to time. It is not unreasonable that where the Customs authorities have made a mistake in classification - for that is what it amounts to - where it is found they have been for a longer or a shorter time charging a higher duty than ought to have been charged, the merchant should claim to have a refund of duty paid upon goods within six months prior to the date of the alteration. If that is not done it will be seen he is placed in a serious position with regard to competitors who may come in the day after the new classification, and get goods cleared at the lower rate of duty, while he has a full stock of goods on which the higher duty has been paid.

                        <para>- This amendment involves a much more serious matter than appears on the face of it. In the interpretation of any Tariff, no matter how clear it is, there must be questions of doubt and difficulty as to the headings under which certain articles are to come. The Customs officials will decide in the first instance, and there may be a number of goods in respect to which it may subsequently be found necessary to alter the duty originally fixed, through articles in one class having to be removed to another class. To show the absurdity of the proposal I need only point out that if it is to be fair all. round, where any alteration has been made making the duty upon an article higher, any person dealing in that article for six months previously ought to pay the difference between the higher duty and what he has paid. There is another difficulty, that it would cause a great deal of confusion in the accounts of the Customs if they were put into such a position that they could not make any amendment of classification which would alter a duty without being prepared to make a refund on all transactions for the previous six months. The amendment would put the department in a position it ought not to be placed in. It would open the door to the possibility of fraud in dealing with these matters. Another important question is as to who is to get the benefit of the refund. The goods upon which the higher duty has been paid may have passed on into the hands of persons who have bought them retail at a price fixed on the basis of the higher duty, and in that case the actual consumer of the goods would not get the benefit of the refund due to the alteration. From every point of view the proposal seems to be open to so much possible evil and injustice that it is far better to lay down the hard and fast rule provided in the clause. </para>

                            <para>- That is a fair question to ask, and I shall answer it. In nearly all cases the goods have their seasons, and the seasons last for six months, and we are supposed to clear all the season's goods in the six months. That is why it is suggested that the term should be six months. </para>

                        <para>- I have an amendment upon this clause vary similar to the amendment I proposed on clause 152. This is practically the appeal clause of the Bill. Under it, if any dispute shall arise as to the amount or rate of duty or as to the liability of goods to duty, the owner may deposit with the collector the amount of duty demanded, and he may thereupon take certain steps which are provided for. There are frequently honest differences of opinion existing between the importer and the Custom-house officer as to classification and various other matters. The first portion of this clause fairly deals with the matter, but it is further provided that the provisions of the clause shall not apply in cases where the Minister is of the opinion that any evasion of the Bill has been committed or attempted, and that appears to me to be a monstrous injustice. That is the very time at which I would fight to the last if the Minister charged me with being guilty of an evasion of the Act. I cannot see why that should be done. There is some little reason for it under clause 159. Surely if we mean to give an appeal to a man where there is a difference of opinion between the department and the importer, we ought not to attempt to stultify that appeal by allowing the Minister to say to the man-" In my opinion you were guilty or were trying to be guilty of an evasion of the Act, and therefore you shall not have an appeal." move - </para>

                            <para>- No. Where there lias been an attempt to defraud the revenue, those cases may be dealt with under other clauses, which provide penalties for such offences. But a person who is under suspicion of having attempted to defraud the Customs cannot get away from the consequences of his act, by simply representing it as an innocent dispute as to the amount of the duty. This clause only provides a way in which a dispute which is entirely free from any element or Suspicion of fraud shall be dealt with. </para>

                        (Tasmania).I rise to ask the Postmaster-General why, if a man pays the proper duty in accordance with the demand of the collector, he should be precluded from going to the law courts ? Is not the effect of the last part of the clause to preclude a man, who has paid the proper duty as demanded, from getting redress, because in the opinion of the Minister a sufficient amount was not asked for?

                        <para>- This clause is one of the most important, if not the most important, in the Bill, because it defines the rights of the people as against an arbitrary decision by an official. There can be an honest doubt as to what classification many items come under. Very many cases have been reported in the newspapers where differences' of opinion have occurred as to how certain goods which have never been imported before were to be classified. This clause provides exactly what shall be done in such- cases. The merchant is to deposit the full amount of the duty which the customs official demands, and then if he considers that an injustice has been done to him he has, under one provision, the right of appeal. But that right can be abrogated under another provision, which says that the Minister may refuse to allow an appeal if in his opinion an evasion of the Act has been committed or attempted. That is putting the importer under a very unfair disadvantage. It seems to me a most monstrous thing, to put that addendum to sub-clause (2) of the first paragraph. If a man has been guilty of an endeavour to evade payment of duty, there are other provisions which apply to the case. But if he lodges the amount of duty which he thinks- the customs official is not entitled to receive, surely he should have the right of appealing to a court of law to decide. I hope that the committee will strike out the latter part of the clause. </para>

                        (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - This provision does not deprive a man of the remedy he has against the collector. If the collector refuses to- give up the goods except on payment of an amount which he has no right to demand, then the importer has a right of action at common law. There is no necessity to give that power in the Bill. This clause simply provides a very easy way in which a dispute as to the amount of duty may be settled. The effect of the last paragraph is to prevent a man, against whom there is a suspicion that he has been engaged in evading the customs, getting out of the liability for his action simply by coming in and getting a certain amount of duty fixed, and saying - " I have paid the duty, and there is an end to, any possible action against me." If there is a suspicion of fraud or wrong-doing against a man, then the collector has his remedy against him ; or if the goods are detained, then the consignee has his remedy at common law against the collector.

                        to inform the committee whether this provision is contained in any State Act. It appears to me that the owner of the goods is fairly entitled to make this demand : either that he shall be given the benefit of the machinery, instituted here for arriving at the settlement of disputes, or that if he is denied that benefit the Minister shall at once proceed to take the matter before the law courts.
                        points out that an aggrieved owner has his remedy at common law, We do not want, if possible, to multiply the necessity for appeals to the law courts. The suggestion I have to make is that the paragraph should be altered to read in this way -

The provisions in the Victorian Act are sections 35, 36, and 37. The substance of this one clause forms the subject matter of those three sections of the Victorian Act. Section 35 says that in case of a dispute the importer may pay the duty. Section 36 says -

                        <para>- We are all agreed that the object we have in view is not to give the benefit of these provisions to a person who has attempted a fraud upon the Customs. The matter in dispute is as to whether we should put it in the power of the Minister, at his own discretion, to decide that there has been an evasion of the Act, or leave that to the court. There are cases in which it is a question of fraud from the beginning. There is no doubt that the Minister should have the right to determine that, where it is a mere question of omission of payment of duty, and where that may be the sole dispute, the case should not be treated as one of fraud. I admit that there may be cases in which it might be hard to leave the matter to be determined by the Minister alone. The Victorian Act provides precisely the same thing, but leaves out the discretion of the Minister. The process under the Victorian Act is that if, in the opinion of the court, there has been an attempt to evade the Act, or the goods have been seized for undervaluation, the Act does not apply at all, and the owner of the goods has to prove his case before the court. The Government are quite satisfied with that provision. Therefore I am willing to adopt the Victorian section, which provides - </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the Minister knows his own business best. But it seems to me that the Victorian section is much more cumbrous than the present provision. Under this clause the goods may be detained until legal action has been taken. If the Minister is of opinion that there has been no evasion of the Act, surely that is quite sufficient. There was something of the kind in the Postal Bill, under which the Postmaster-General might, with the consent of the parties, impose certain penalties without going to the court. </para>

                        <para>- I would prefer that the Minister left the clause as it stands. It is much more effective than the Victorian section. Suppose a merchant were attempting to evade the customs in the opinion of the Minister or the collector. As soon as the individual found that there was a shadow of suspicion, although he might be conscientiously guilty, he would, under the proposed amendment, simply say, " I will pay the duty," and then the goods would be delivered. The object is to prevent fraudulent individuals from taking advantage of their opportunities, and I think that the clause is preferable to the Victorian section. </para>

                        <para>- I have an amendment here which is really consequential upon the amendment which has already been agreed to with regard to exports, in a clause in which it was sought to provide that there should be security taken that goods would be landed, and proof given that they had been landed, at the port for which they were entered. We struck that out, inasmuch as it was impossible for the merchant to insure that. Exactly the same difficulty arises under this clause, in which a person claiming drawback on any goods is expected to make a declaration upon the debenture that the goods have been exported, and have not been relanded. It is utterly impossible for him to make such a declaration. All he can say is - " I put them on board such-and-such a ship. I can say it was not intended they should be relanded ; but I can make no declaration that they have not been relanded." </para>

                        <para>- The power given to the Minister under this clause is a little too autocratic. He is not only given power to refuse payment of a drawback debenture unless it is presented for payment within one year from the date of the shipment of the goods for export, but he is given power to prohibit payment altogether, and, so far as I can see, without any right of appeal. I would like to hear some explanation of the clause. </para>

                        <para>- When we look at what this drawback debenture is, it will be apparent that this clause is essential; The drawback debenture is a note which passes from hand to hand wherever the goods go. It is really an acknowledgment by the Government that this amount of money shall be paid. It will be agreed that it is reasonable that no drawback debenture should be paid, except with the consent of the Minister, if it is not presented for payment within one year. Then the clause provides that the Minister may prohibit the payment of a drawback debenture, and what that means is, that the Minister may have some knowledge of transactions- in connexion with the goods which would make it clear that it ought not to be paid. This is one of the powers which must be given for the purpose of enabling fraud to be punished, if it is discovered after the goods are gone, and there is no opportunity of dealing with the persons who have been guilty of swindling in any other way than by refusing to pay the debenture. It is only like stopping the payment of a cheque, and it is still left an open question whether the person presenting* it is entitled to have it paid by the Customs or not. There may be something suspicious about a debenture which may be presented in a hurry, and the Minister may have some circumstance brought to his knowledge which would render it inadvisable that the debenture should be met in the ordinary way. I think the clause ought to be preserved. </para>

                        (Western Australia).The clause takes away none of the rights of the holder of the debenture, but merely allows the Minister to refuse to pay the debenture if he considers there are any suspicious circumstances connected with it, just as I may refuse to honour my cheque. The person who holds the debenture can still bring an action against the Crown to make the Minister pay, just as the holder of my cheque may bring an action against me.

                            <para>- I do not see anything in what the honorable and learned senator has said to alter my view of the subject. I would like to correct a mistake I made in saying that a debenture passed from hand to hand like a promissory note, a bank note, or a cheque. I have the form of the document here. It is .simply an acknowledgment by the Customs to the individual that so much is due, and it would give no right to any one but the person in whose favour it was made out. That gets rid of all questions about innocent holders of drawback debentures for value. The 'point is that in the interval between the time the drawback debenture is given and the time it is presented for payment, something may come to the knowledge of the Minister which would make it unreasonable' that he should pay the money, and why should he be forced to pay it because for want of knowledge of the circumstances, this acknowledgement of indebtedness has been given? Under the clause the Minister is given power to revoke the acknowledgement if he finds it expedient in the interests of the public to do so. But the power does not in any way affect the right of the holder of the drawback debenture to bring an action to recover payment, lt is a very necessary power to enable the Government to stop payment of an acknowledgment which they have given, just exactly in the same way as a man has power to stop payment of a cheque he has given. If a man stops payment of his cheque, the holder cannot sue on th cheque ; but 'there is no reason why he should not sue on the consideration which was given for the cheque. So in this case there is nothing to prevent a man from suing to recover the duty. I hope that the committee will leave the clause as it is, because otherwise the Customs authorities might be put in this exceedingly foolish position, that although some circumstances had come to their knowledge which made it extremely doubtful whether the whole transaction on the goods was not a swindle, they would be bound to pay drawback on their acknowledgment. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt in one sense it would be quite sufficient for the Customs authorities to have a manifest or an account of all the goods without distinguishing them. But it would be very useful and essential for our statistical purposes to have this division made. It would impose no additional trouble on the owner of the goods or the ship-master, and certainly it would be very beneficial for the Commonwealth to have a record in this way. I take it that the manifest will show what the captain has on board his vessel. </para>

                            <para>- The New Zealand Act may contain such a section, but it must be obvious to any one that the return is of very little value, and must be treated in the most contemptuous manner by those who know its uselessness. If a man is asked to do what is impossible he may do his best to meet the wishes of those who ask him, but he cannot do that which is beyond his powers. </para>

                            <para>- It will be of great advantage to the Commonwealth to have statistics with regard to the quantity of Australian products carried on coasting steamers. It is of immense importance that we should have these statistics when we can get them, because in perhaps one case in a hundred the master may not be able to give the information, why should we forego the opportunity of getting it in the other 99 cases. It is to be supposed that the Act will be administered reasonably by men who know their business and have a fair regard for those with whom they are dealing day after day. </para>

                        <para>- I entirely agree that if this information is obtainable it will be very useful indeed. But, if it is not obtainable with a fair amount of accuracy, the statistics will not be worth anything, but will be misleading. I can well understand that the masters of vessels will not have the information. All a master knows is that he has a case of goods, but he does not know the contents of the case. I should say that the manufacturer of the goods would be the better person to give the information. The Minister says that the provision will be administered by officers anxious to carry it out satisfactorily, and thoroughly conversant with the workings of the department and the Act. I need hardly remind him that after the Commonwealth was established the Custom-house promulgated certain regulations with respect to imports and exports, and that those regulations caused such an uproar that they had to be withdrawn. That occurred only within the last few weeks. </para>

                        sees in the way of getting this information. In New Zealand the information is obtained under the transire system. There would be no difficulty about getting the information from the Commonwealth under that system.

                    <para>
                        (New South Wales). - The value of information depends altogether on its accuracy. I would rather have a small amount of information, if it were accurate, than a warehouse full which was inaccurate. The inclusion of the words to which I have taken exception would be likely to lead to inaccurate information being supplied. There should be schedules for all descriptions of goods so far as the information is obtainable, and not only with regard to Australian goods.
