"We cannot be said on this occasion to be departing from any precedent because there is no precedent. This is the first Bill which has been brought forward in the Senate. The first section of chapter I. of the Constitution Act says the Parliament shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives. I think it is the correct course, having in view that section of the Constitution, that we should adopt the form of the enacting words which I now propose. </para>

                    <para>- Some amendment is necessary. I do not think the words " the Parliament of the Commonwealth " are enough in themselves, because they assume that the Parliament of the Commonwealth is omnipotent, whereas, of course, we know it is not. It is simply an assumption of authority which we in no way possess, and which I should think we in no way wish to assert. It seems to me that the motion of the Postmaster-General puts the proposition in very terse terms. He might have said "the King's Most Excellent Majesty and the Parliament of the Commonwealth." </para>

                        <para>- I understand that perfectly. The point I am making is that the terms are practically synonymous. We can either use one or the other.

He really should have inserted the words "the Federal Parliament," or else the words he now proposes to substitute. </para>

                    has pointed out, the, definition that is contained in section 1 is a definition for the purposes of the Constitution Act only. If that definition were contained in the measure which we are about to deal with, which defines a number of terms which, whenever they are used, will have the interpretation therein given to them, then no doubt " the Parliament of the Commonwealth" would be sufficient. I think,
                    that
                    is quite right, and that " the Parliament of the Commonwealth" means, nothing, because there is no definition of. the words "the Parliament of the Common* wealth," unless it is used within the four corners of the Act for the purposes of which that definition is given. Therefore, it seems to me quite clear that either the words that have been suggested by the Postmaster-General, ' or the words " the Federal Parliament " should be substituted for the words "the Parliament of the Commonwealth .

                        <para>- I see that is so - I was misled by an inaccurate marginal note which calls it a preamble. It is really the recital of the enacting clause. This is, of course, a . question of the very highest importance, because we are laying down the lines upon "these matters of our constitutional procedure. Everything is new, and it is possible that some considerable discussion may be raised as to the introduction of these words, looking at the powers of the Senate under the Constitution. The earliest moment available should be set apart to most effectually deal with it. I ask, for our guidance, whether it would be better to deal with-it on the second reading or by an instruction when going into committee, or whether it could be sufficiently dealt with in committee. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the committee can deal with it without an instruction. I think the same course should be adopted as we followed in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Bill. It is a well-understood rule of Parliament that a committee can only act within the powers delegated to it, and the enacting part of a Bill is not delegated to it. instructions will, therefore, have to be given to the committee to deal with it. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to do anything that is in any way inconvenient either to the Postmaster-General or any one else. But I could not see how this question could be raised except as a matter of privilege. No doubt we might throw out the Bill altogether ; but we do not desire to do that, seeing that this is the first Bill of the kind to be introduced into the Parliament of the Commonwealth. All that my motion is intended to do is to place on record the fact that, though we allow the Government to pass a Bill which contains, in our opinion, what it ought .not to contain, we do not commit ourselves to the precedent in any way. That is the sole object of the motion, and I have mentioned it now in order that my right of moving it as a matter of privilege may be established. I understand that if one desires to move on a question of privilege, it must be done immediately the question arises. Consequently, immediately the Minister put the Bill on the table, I rose to protest against provisions which, in my opinion, should not be in it. So long as my right is preserved, I am quite prepared to allow the motion to stand over until such time as the Government have time to consider it, and the Senate has time to look into the matter. </para>

                        <para>- It could be recommitted ; but we have two Bills running side by side, and it is hardly safe to assume that the one will become law without alteration. But, entirely apart from that, I am still of opinion that it is desirable that the last two lines should be retained, because the clause in the Acts Interpretation Bill does not apply to a case of this kind, where the head of the department is giving instructions to his officers. The term " instrument" or regulation used there, I think, scarcely contemplates an instrument that is made by Act of Parliament or regulations that are made and have the force of law. If honorable senators will turn to the clause relating to regulations they will see where the clause of the Acts Interpretation Bill will come in. Power is given to make regulations, but nothing is said about rescinding or revoking or amending them. That power is implied. It is desirable - I think necessary - that in this Bill the power to revoke any instructions to officers should be distinctly given. </para>

                    <para>- - I would like very seriously to put it to the Minister whether this is not really reducing legislation to a very low level. I mean that to put in a clause in a solemn Act of this Parliament that these unfortunate messenger boys by virtue of statute sholl, at the age of eighteen years, retire from the service, unless, of course, in the meantime they are transferred to a better position, is really quite unnecessary. There are some other provisions which might well be left out, but this one is purely administrative. Surety, it does not require an Act of Parliament to enable the head of the department to make a rule in the ordinary service that messengers, when they reach the age of eighteen years, shall no longer be messengers, and they must go if they do not get any other position. Of course, there is no need of the latter portion of the clause, because, if they are transferred, there is no necessity for the application of the provision. It is really reducing our legislation to a very petty position to enact that a messenger boy in the telegraph service must retire on attaining this age. I think we ought to omit the clause. </para>

                    <para>- It certainty strikes one as being very extraordinary that the committee should deliberately enact that a person should retire from a service when he does not occupy the position which is designated. In other words, the clause states plainly that he has to retire providing he is not somewhere else. I think the latter part of the clause at least should be struck out if the clause itself is not negatived. How can we gravely enact that a lad shall not be a telegraph messenger when he is already something else ? </para>

                        <para>- He might be a small light-weight who would make a very good messenger all his life. He might not have become very large or robust as he has got on in years, but he might still be useful as a messenger when perhaps his physical condition would not fit him to endure more severe physical strain. I agree as to the desirability of leaving the exercise of a power of this kind in the hands of the Minister or the Cabinet. </para>

Suppose there is nothing for him to go to. Is he to be turned into the street after having given four or five years of service? It is a serious hardship to impose on a young man. I would much rather see the matter left in the hands of the Minister and his subordinate than have it made a hard-and-fast rule that a youth must go.

                    <para>- In my opinion the committee will make a very great mistake if it omits the clause. When a boy enters the service, and a provision of this kind is law, it means that the contract he makes with the State is that he can only remain, until he is eighteen years of age. In the meantime, therefore, he has to secure for himself some other appointment. If the section, were not in the Act, and that boy were permitted to remain, gradually he would become 20, 25, 30, and 40 years of age, with the result that the Government, to its disgrace, would have men in its service who, probably, in the meantime had got married and had reared a family. </para>

                        <para>- These persons are only required for this class of work. The duties are worth no more than would be paid to these boys attaining to 18 years of age. These boys, if permitted to remain, remain at this minimum salary for a very considerable time. Perhaps in the meantime they become married men with families, and I was pointing out that the disgrace is that the Government have in their employ married men with families, at from 15s. to 16s. per week-. </para>

                        <para>- My honorable friend's encouraging "hear, hear" confirms me in the position I take up. If influence is brought to bear in respect of a number of lads in the service of the Telegraph department, then a weak Minister would be able to say - "I cannot interfere. I am bound hand and foot, and must do as this inexorable law compels me to do.These boys must go into the street even though they go practically to a state of starvation, because I am powerless." I do not think that we ought to legislate to relieve Ministers of the Crown of a fair responsibility. This is a great administrative department, and Ministers must have the strength to put into their contracts that when a lad attains the age of eighteen years he must leave the department unless there is something else available for him to do ; then the Minister will be able to exercise a merciful consideration, and to say to a boy-" Very good. You have attained the age of eighteen years, and your contract leaves it in my option to turn you adrift, but I will give you another three months, or another six months." I think myself it would be a humane tiring for that reason, apart from everything else, to strike this clause out. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable senators may pretend to be very virtuous, but it is common talk and a common experience that a Minister does at times want to be protected against himself. Perhaps he wants to be protected against certain men who are supporting him in the House, and who wish for selfish motives to attain a certain object. I believe that the general wish is that the department should be administered fairly, equitably, and honorably, and that can be done by adding a little proviso declaring that before these lads sire turned adrift an inquiry shall be made as to whether there are other offices which they can fill. At the same time it is not desirable that they should be kept on indefinitely unless some other avenue of employment is open to them. </para>

                    <para>- The proposal that has been made that the clause should be struck out and the power left in the hands of the Minister looks well at first sight, but I do not think it would work well. The trouble is that the Postmaster- gGeneral will hot administer the department for all time. One Postmaster-eneral will have different ideas to another. As the instructions which he gives to his deputies are revocable at any time, it will simply mean that the regulation may be altered at any time in order to allow of some particular individual being retained in the service. We are told that we should try to preserve a certain amount of elasticity, but elasticity implies contraction as well as extension. There will be no elasticity in this matter ; it will simply be continual extension. If a Postmaster-General, under pressure, perhaps, from friends, allows a man to remain as a messenger until he has passed the age of eighteen or perhaps nineteen or twenty, and another goes even farther, will it be possible to get any reform ? If it is considered, then, as most senators seem to consider now, that eighteen is a fair age for a boy to retire, and if a Postmaster-General comes in, who holds that opinion, and wishes to put it into operation, what is he to do? He is at once to discharge all the messengers over that age. It would be a very much greater hardship to require a man who is above eighteen to retire than it would be to require a boy to retire at eighteen, according to the provisions of the statute. I think, therefore, this provision should be in the Bill. With regard to the age at which a young fellow could join, I think that might be left to the regulations. </para>

                        <para>- The school age varies in the different States ; but we will always have this safeguard - that a boy cannot be employed as a messenger until he is over the school age. If he is intelligent and able to do the work I cannot see that there is any wrong in employing him from the time that he leaves school. I am of opinion, therefore, education being a State matter, that in each State a boy should be taken on from the expiration of the school age. I consider that the provision requiring a boy to retire at eighteen should be in the Bill, because it relates only to boys' work. We do not want men employed in this capacity, and I do not think it is any advantage to the community generally that men who ought to be doing other work should be employed as messengers. A boy past eighteen who hangs on to a position like that is only keeping another boy out of it. We ought to take it as a necessity that in this community when a young man becomes eighteen he should have some better occupation to. follow than that of. running about with telegrams. </para>

                    <para>- The point under discussion is not whether a boy should or should not retire at the age of eighteen, but whether we should insert that provision iii this Bill. I quite agree that, no one should be employed in this capacity over the age of eighteen, and I hope it will never be found necessary to employ young men at this very low wage, because I presume the rate of wage for messenger boys will be fixed. Surely a lad of eighteen employed as a messenger will seek work elsewhere in order to obtain better remuneration. </para>

                        <para>- Then that only proves that opportunities for profitable employment must have been very bad indeed, otherwise I cannot imagine a young man over eighteen continuing to be a messenger boy, and to be classed as a messenger boy. I object, however to the limit being inserted in the Bill. It seems to me that we should have responsible Ministers. I presume our Ministers are responsible, and they should take the responsibility of boldly saying- -"The time has come when this lad must leave the service. There is no chance of promotion, and he must retire." Surely any man in the position of Postmaster-General or Deputy Postmaster-General should be able to take that responsibility. </para>

                    <para>- Perhaps, my honorable friend, the mover of the amendment, will see that he must carry it a little further in order to make it effective. Reference is made in the amendment to some standard of education, but it is not stated where that standard exists. 'Possibly, it is a Queensland standard, but I do not know ; and, having no knowledge of what the standard is, I assume that if the Postmaster-General were called upon to administrate the clause in that amended form, he would also be in the dark. The amendment should, therefore, be carried further, so as to clearly indicate what standard is referred to. </para>

                    (Queensland).- I do not know that we have any standard of education in Queensland. There is a standard of education in Great Britain. There no boy or girl can be employed in certain work until they have reached a certain age, or unless they have reached the fourth standard of education. I know that has been a provision in the mining laws of Great Britain since 1872.

                        <para>- Speaking more particularly in regard to Queensland; I do not think there is anything known as to the fifth standard, so that that term would have no meaning there. The principle which should be adopted is, that a boy should not be employed until he has passed the school age, and that he should be employed as soon after as possible, certainly not before. </para>

I understand that there is a proposal to strike the clause out altogether, but I cannot see the good sense of doing that. The Minister is administering a department here, and he has had experience of administering a department in Queensland. Those of us who have any knowledge of post-office business in this State recognise that there is a dreadful struggle to maintain these young messenger boys in the department after a certain age, and you cannot wonder at it. </para>

                        <para>- It is due to one thing, at any rate. Once a man or boy enters the public service not in one case in 10,000 is he anxious to leave it. If they start as boys at a few shillings a week and run up to 30s. a week they will remain there until they are old men rather than face the world. I agree with the Minister that it is better for these youths to face the world when they can battle with it and engage in the pursuits of the world. If you leave them there until they are 25 they are men, and will not adapt themselves to new surroundings. I urge the Senate to -adopt the clause, because I do not see what harm it can do. The Minister is anxious to be protected in this matter, and if he is not' there will be eternal importunity to allow this and that bright boy to remain in the department doing a man's work, when he ought to be a farmer or miner or carpenter, or be engaged in some other employment. I do not see any great objection to the proposal, only to admit boys at a certain age, say 13, or after the school age, but I say- to strike out the clause will make the Bill more difficult to work. Instead of making it more difficult we should make it more simple. </para>

                    <para>- I have been wondering why the Postmaster-General is taking the power for his officers to use any pier, wharf, landing place, bridge or ferry, without compensating the owners for the use of their property. I recognise that he must have the power for his officers to use these tilings, but seeing that we shall have to pay the railway authorities and all other persons for the carnage of our mails, I think, that some provision ought to be made for payment to those persons whose property the department uses. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me rather unfair that the quays, jetties, and piers of the States should be used for a purpose of this kind without some compensation being paid to them as well as private owners for such services. "While the Postal department was in the hands of the States, it made no difference whether it used the railways, the piers, or the quays of the States for carrying postal and telegraphic material-; but now I apprehend that each State will have to pay the Federal Government for the carriage of its letters and parcels just as private persons will do. I do not see why the State more than a private person should contribute towards the cost of constructing telegraph lines and telephone lines. The words in paragraph (f) cover all material, I understand. I do not see why these things should go across free, as the letters are not to be carried for the States free of cost. </para>

                    (Victoria).- I did not refer to the mails at all, but to material required for the construction of new works or the maintenance of existing works. In some cases large quantities of material will be brought into' a State, and its wharfs, piers and jetties will have to be used, and even if a wharf belongs to a State, I do not see why it should not be paid for the use of them. I am speaking only of construction, and not of the carriage of the mails. This is a big principle, and I am quite sure that honorable senators will see that time 'after time, when we are considering not only postal matters, but other matters, this same question will arise as to whether the States are to receive any compensation 'for certain works carried out by them, or permitted to be carried out by them. . It seems to me that in those cases the State has a right - as I understand that it will be paid for the carriage of all mails - to be reimbursed the cost of maintaining any works which the telegraph and postal department may use in the transport of their material.

                        <para>- The last speaker has spoken particularly of wharfs, vessels and jetties, but the wharfs and jetties may be in the hands of private individuals, and though of course the argument I have used may not be quite so strong in regard to conveying material as it is in regard to allowing the mails to pass, it really is an extension of the same principle. Suppose a telegraph line requires to be constructed, and there is only one landing-place where the wire can be landed, and the jetty is in the hands of a private person who says " I shall not allow you to land your wire unless, you pay so much upon it." In that case' it will prevent the construction of a telegraph line. </para>

                    (South Australia). - I understood it to be a principle laid down by the . Postmaster-General that he was not desirous, as head of the department, of doing any gratuitous work, neither was he anxious to get gratuitous work done for him. Therefore, I think that we are under the necessity of dealing with this clause in a way that will carry out the principle enunciated by the Postmaster-General in the very able speech which he made, when introducing this Bill.

                        <para>- It is the practice in Queensland not to allow contracts to be sublet; of course I am speaking from memory, but 1 feel sure that I am correct. It has to be borne in mind also- that sureties have to be given in the case of every contract for its efficient performance and no such provision is violated. </para>

                        <para>- I know of a case in which, to my own knowledge, a contract was sublet in Queensland, although the contractor had to provide sureties. As a rule the man who is in a position to get sureties is in a position to carry out his contract. But in cases where men are anxious to obtain contracts and are not able to get sureties, they get contracts sublet to them, and these are generally carried out in an unsatisfactory manner, both to the Government and to the public. These men are very often late with their mails. They are, as a rule, small selectors. They have a number of bush horses, and expect to carry out their work with grass-fed animals. When a dry season comes they cannot afford to buy feed for them, and in very many cases they have to throw up their contracts. Subletting is always a bad principle to be allowed. If this clause were amended by the insertion of a provision prohibiting a contractor from subletting his contract, it would be all right. </para>

Clause 14 requires the consent of the Governor-General to arrangements with the United Kingdom or any foreign country. Clause 15 gives the Postmaster-General, without any action of the Cabinet, unlimited power" with regard to all other contracts. Many of these contracts will involve very considerable sums of money. They will be larger than those referred to in clause 14,. which are hedged about by the consent of the Governor-General in Council. Clause- 15 provides - </para>

                        <para>- It has been almost the invariable practice for the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts. Clause 14 provides for arrangements being made with bodies outside our own country,, and that being so it is necessary that that should be done by the Governor-General in Council. Clause 15 refers to contracts made with persons, and the Postmaster-General, I think, is the proper authority to have that power. Of course the Postmaster-General in a matter of that sort means the Government. </para>

I wish to point out that; while it has been the custom in some States for . the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts of his own motion, still, we are dealing now, not with one State, but with six States. The amounts involved in some of these contracts will be exceedingly large. I think it will be wise, in the interests of the Commonwealth, if we . provide that the power to enter into these contracts shall not be vested solely in the Minister, but in the" Governor-General -in Council.

                    - The clauses overlap. If we are going, to distinguish between' the authority possessed by the Governor-General in Council in entering into contracts in regard to these mails by land or sea, and desire to confide to him the power to enter into such contracts, we must have some limit to clause 15. Under the latter clause, the Postmaster-General has power actually to enter into these contracts irrespective of the Governor-General in Council altogether. There is no limitation whatever of his power under clause 15. The Postmaster-General can enter into contracts with Great Britain under that clause. It is in consequence of the overlapping of the powers here given that this confusion has arisen. I agree with the Postmaster-General as to the impossibility of the Governor in Council dealing with all these small, mail contracts throughout the Commonwealth. It is simply out of the question. We want, in the first place, to clearly state that the Governor-General should have sole power with regard to the important mail contracts with, foreign countries, and with the mother country. Under clause 15, the Postmaster-General and other people, who might be authorized by the Governor-General, would have power, to make these contracts. The confusion has arisen from the taking of a clause out of one particular Act and a clause out of another Act, without noticing that the powers given by the one overlap the other. We should limit the powers of the Postmaster-General under clause 15 to matters within the Commonwealth. That, I believe, is what was really intended. If we do this we may still- authorize the Deputy Postmasters-General throughout the States to deal with tenders as they have been doing in the past, accepting them and signing them on. behalf- of the Governor-General, who is the head of the Commonwealth in that respect. Some new words should be introduced in clause 15. Several proposals have been made in regard to it.
                    desires to move something in respect to it, and I think it would be wise to postpone its consideration until we have gone through the rest of the Bill. The Postmaster-General would then be able to come down with such limitations of the powers conferred on him under clause 1 5 as would prevent them overlapping the powers of the Governor-General.

At the Berlin convention we entered into arrangements with the United Kingdom and with foreign countries with regard to the carriage of one another's mails. We have an agreement by which our mails are carried by those countries and their mails are carried by us. That is quite a different thing to a contract. The person who must negotiate and make arrangements with a power outside of ourselves, either Great Britain or any foreign country, must be the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the honorable senator's assurance upon that point. 1 think perhaps he is correct. The contract in that case is ' made by the British Postmaster-General, and we make arrangements with him by which, on the payment of a certain sum of money, our mails are carried for us. That is an arrangement that could he entered into by the Governor-General. </para>

                        <para>- The Premiers made the arrangements through the Agents-General. The contract was not entered into until we had agreed with the Imperial Government.

For all practical purposes I say we entered into a contract. </para>

                        <para>- Seeing that there is a considerable difference of opinion with regard to. the power which should be conferred on the Postmaster-General in the making of contracts, and that there is a likelihood of this clause clashing with clause 15, I have no objection to its postponement. The Postmaster-General struck a note that I think is worthy of some consideration. My intention with regard to this amendment is not merely to confine its operation to the manning of ships with white crews within the confines of the Commonwealth. I am anxious that the ships which cany our mails to Great Britain and elsewhere, shall be manned by people of our own colour. I do not want to circumscribe the operation of the amendment. I want, as I believe the people generally want, to carry ou.t a policy both on land and on sea, that companies who carry our mails shall employ white and not black men. At the same time, if there is no fear of the amendment being in any way jeopardized, I have no objection to the postponement of the clause. " The whole question can be considered in the meantime, and we can debate it fully afterwards. </para>

I do .not know what conclusion senators have come to on the subject, but I would like to point out that it is absolutely necessary that this power should be given. I think I can show the reason why, and if I can show that it is absolutely necessary, I shall have gone a long way to prove that we have the power under the Constitution. </para>

                    <para>- I do not intend in any way to thwart the Government in seeking to carry the clause, if they have so determined, in the form in which it appears. I do, however, intend to record my protest against it for more than one reason. First of . all, I do not think the Commonwealth has power to enact a clause of the kind, and I would ask that the Senate be careful in a matter which practically means encroaching very seriously upon State rights. Now, we are here to protect the rights of the States, and if they bear in mind the fundamental principle underlying the Constitution, perhaps honorable senators -will realize the doubt there is as to whether we have power to. make an arrangement of this kind. The several States joined together, and declared that in respect of various matters which they enumerated in section 51 of the Constitution, they would give the" control to the Commonwealth Parliament. With regard to everything else, the residue of control, that was to remain in the hands of the several States. The States in particular have been specially careful to retain absolute control of the railways, as they have retained all liability in regard to debts and loans contracted for the purpose of malting those railways. There was one exception made when it was provided in sub-section 32 of section 51 of the Constitution Act : - </para>

                        <para>- I am not saying a word' against the policy of the matter. If this Parliament has the power to do it it is completely right, but in my opinion it has not the power to enact a clause of the kind. It is quite true that a tribunal is provided whereby differences of the kind may be settled, and if the States feel strongly about it, as I have reason to think some of them do, it will be competent for them to go to the High Court, when it is established, and to see whether this Parliament had the power to make a law of that kind. </para>

It is true that the value of the service rendered has to be ascertained by arbitration in the prescribed manner. My opinion is that it would be wise for the committee to omit the clause, but, on the other hand, there is no harm in putting in a clause enabling the Commonwealth to enter into the necessary bargains with the State. ' It may be suggested at once that the State may be most unreasonable, and may refuse to meet the Commonwealth. In that case the State is acting within its rights, but I cannot conceive it possible for a moment that a State which exists to serve the public in the same way as the Commonwealth does would act in any selfish, unfair, or unjust spirit in a business arrangement. I shall content myself with milking my protest. I. have not had an opportunity, I very much regret to. say, to further look up the matter and to secure any authorities in support of my contention. I do not know whether it is possible to obtain any authorities which would directly bear on the point, but nothing that has been said goes to indicate to me that my contention is wrong. </para>

                    <para>The implications from the provisions of a Constitution are sometimes exceedingly important, and have large influence upon its construction. In regard to the Constitution of the United States, the rule has been laid down that where a general power is conferred or duty enjoined, every particular power necessary for the exercise of the one or the performance of the other is also conferred. The same rule has been applied to the State Constitution, with an important modification by the Supreme Court of Illinois. " That other powers than those expressly granted may be, and often are, conferred by implication, is too well settled to be doubted. Under every Constitution the doctrine of implication must be resorted to in order to carry out the general grants of- power. A Constitution cannot, from its very nature, enter into a minute specification of all the minor powers naturally and obviously included in it, and flowing from the great and important ones which are expressly granted. It is therefore established as a general rule that when a Constitution gives a general power, or enjoins a duty it also gives by implication every particular power necessary for the exercise of the one or the performance of the other. The implication under this rule, however, must be a necessary, not a conjectural or argumentative one. And it is further modified by another rule, that where the means for the exercise of a grant of power are given, no other or different means can be implied as being more effectual or convenient." The rule applies to the exercise of- power by all departments and all officers, and will be touched upon incidentally hereafter. </para>

                        <para>- Once we could transport our mails to every State by water ; but practically, in order to carry our mails from one State to another, we have to pass over the railroads, and in some cases we have to pass over the railways of an intervening State. I have shown the reason why it is absolutely necessary that this power should be given. It was not so necessary before federation, for the reason that the same Government was running the mails and running the railways, and being the same party there could not possibly be any conflict. But now that we are dealing with the railways of six different States it is absolutely necessary, in order that justice shall be done to all, that there shall be power given to provide for the carriage of the mails over those railways, and for fixing the rate of remuneration to be paid to the States. The whole thing can be pretty well clinched by what has taken place during the last two or three days. I am not going to mention the particular State concerned, but one of the Deputy Postmasters-General received a letter from the Railways Commissioner in one of the States saying that after a certain date a certain sum of money would be required for the carriage of the mails, and asking him to see that the amount was ' provided on the Estimates. Seeing that the amount paid to the railways of that State had been increased only a short tune before by about-  </para>

                    objecting to this very wholesome provision. Clause 16 says that the Postmaster-General may make a bargain with any State for the carriage of the Commonwealth mails over its' railways. If the Postmaster-General sought power to compel the Railways Commissioner to run a particular train, for the carriage of those mails there would be something in
                    argument ; but inasmuch as he only proposes to utilize the excess service, where is the objection ? There is not a railway company in existence that would not jump at such a provision. If the Commonwealth Government attempted to impose on a State railway a condition that it should convey mails at a price that did not pay, then all our sympathies would be against the Commonwealth. But the Commonwealth Government merely proposes to ' make the

                    (South Australia). - It seems to me that the arguments in favour of the contention of the Postmaster-General upon this point are absolutely overwhelming. If it is, as hinted at by
                    that this case may be eventually taken to our Federal Court for decision, I am sure that that Court will give a similar decision to that given by Chief Justice Marshall in the United States, and that the same law will govern this Commonwealth as governs that country. That decision is a sound common sense one. If we give any particular body legislative power to do certain things, we give them power to do everything necessary for the carrying out of the powers we have granted them. When we are told that Parliament has the power to make laws for the good government of the Commonwealth, &lt;fcc., there is not the slightest doubt that full powers were intended and are given. Therefore anything we may require to do for the purpose of carrying on the postal work, we have power to do in reason. It surprises me entirely that
                    should have agreed only a few minutes ago to pass a clause giving the Postmaster-General power to have his mails carried over jetties without paying one cent for that privilege, and yet that he should grumble now that we take power to provide that the mails shall be carried over the railways of the Commonwealth. He has swallowed the camel and is now straining at the dreadful gnat. He swallowed the provision that Parliament shall have the right of the carriage of mails over State jetties and State wharfs as well as private jetties and private wharfs without the payment of a cent to anybody, and yet he never called attention to the fact of how utterly unconstitutional that thing was.

                        <para>- Upon my word, these lawyers are altogether terrible. The point is so fearfully fine that I am not able to see it in the present circumstances. The honorable senator made use of that argument to show that if the framers of the Constitution had intended that the Commonwealth Government should have power to run its postal matter over the railways, they would have put in a special provision to that effect, because they put in a special provision in regard to military matters. The whole thing falls to the ground when one comes to look at it. I agree with the Government and shall support the clause. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria.) -
                    says that he is quite certain as to the legality of this clause. I ' wish that I were as sure of its legality as I am of its necessity. I voted for the retention of clause 13 as I shall vote for this clause, because the Bill without these two clauses would be-absolutely useless. I shall vote for it for another reason. If it is to be questioned at all, the sooner it is questioned the better. By including this power, or supposed power, in the Bill, it will. give an opportunity for any one of the States to at once test the matter before the High Court. Unless the power be put in the Bill, then, clearly, the point cannot be brought before the Court so speedily. I trust that, when once disposed of, it will be acted upon immediately, and then we shall lose no time in learning whether the States acquiesce in the power or not. If they do not acquiesce, then the point can be settled before the High Court.

                        <para>- I do not anticipate that even constitutional litigation will be likely to eventuate from the passage of this clause. It is only a matter of form rather than a matter of substance. The necessity for the clause everybody, agrees with, and there is nothing in clause '16, coupled with clause 17, -which is likely to make the Commonwealth press hardly upon any State. But, it is a matter of form, and, representing as we do the several States, and being here to guard-State rights, we should hesitate before we simply arrogate to ourselves, in my opinion, the right to dictate, even for the purpose of running a transferred service, in what particular way the officials in a department that is not transferred shall act, so that we shall be able to carry out our work. </para>

Honorable senators who are now arguing for State rights have accepted that provision without a word. Now they object' even to the Postmaster-General having the peremptory right to the use of railways. </para>

                <para>SenatorCHARLESTON.- What I am contending for is that, seeing we have already granted the Postmaster-General power as to State wharfs, powers must be given to him in regard to this matter, commensurate with the duties to be performed. In view of the fact that the six States have entered into a compact, and have decided that the one central authority created by themselves shall do a certain thing, then that carries with it also the right and the power of the Commonwealth to give effect to it. </para>

No doubt it removes any irritation that might be felt at the Federal Parliament dictating to the States a course which is questionable Now, what is the practical difficulty? We ask the Postmaster-General to make arrangements with the' Parliaments of the various States. Would it be possible for the Parliaments of those States to remain unreasonable ? If they did so, the whole of the carriage of their mails would be stopped, and the outcome would be that the people in the various States would get no mails carried.

Passing from the historical significance of Bunbury, I would say that there are steamers running daily and weekly from Bunbury to Perth. Could it be urged, therefore, that it was necessary for the Postmaster - General to carry his mails over the railway from Bunbury to Perth ? Certainly not necessary, although it might be more ' convenient. Does the case which my honorable friend has quoted, say that the Postmaster-General shall do that which is more convenient. No ; he can only compel that which is necessary. Sub-section (39) of section 51 of the Constitution Act says- </para>

                        <para>- There is a dead-lock. Still they will say " We stand by our commissioner and insist on £100,000." I do not mind what terms are used, but I hope that the terms will be as polite as may be, so long as we do not give up the most important position, that we must have the right of saying; that the mails shall be carried. We provide the fairest possible means of fixing the amount of remuneration, but it is not to rest with the railway commissioner, or with the Executive authority in any State to say - "We fix the price and you must pay it, else the mails will not be carried." I cannot support the amendment. </para>

                    (Queensland). - I do not think that the argument used by the Postmaster-General carries much weight; for the reason that if, by any mischance a railway/ commissioner is so ill-advised as to do this: kind of thing, any proposal on his part to submit to arbitration would naturally be adopted at once, as provided in the clause. I would ask the Minister whether in the case of a railway commissioner refusing to carry the mails because he is not getting a sufficient price, or in the case of a refusal on his part to go to arbitration, and the consequent irritation and loss to the people of the State,, the Parliament would not immediately rise to the occasion and o impel the railway commissioner to come to terms ?

                        <para>.- We do not wish to be passing laws merely to provoke litigation. I find in the 39 articles embodied in section 51 of the Constitution Act that there is a special provision in subsection (32) which gives the Common wealth control over railways in respect of transport for military purposes. If it had been intended by the framers of the Constitution that, this authority should be given over the railways of the different States, it certainly would have been embodied in the Constitution. I go further and say that the fact that military purposes are specifically set down as being a proper authority for .the Commonwealth to possess, absolutely as a matter of law excludes the right of 'the Commonwealth to any other control of the railways. </para>

                    <para>- It is very nearly time that we left law alone and exercised a little bit of common sense. The more legal opinion we have had up to the present time the more confused we poor laymen seem to get. As far as the Senate is concerned, I think that in a short time legal opinion will be considered nonsense. We have one honorable senator getting up and declaring - "We have no power to do this." Another honorable senator from the other side of the House exclaims - "Just look at the latter part of the clause where the States are asked to provide something." The States are asked to provide nothing that the Commonwealth is not willing and does not expect to pay for. To illustrate this I will call attention to clause 63, which compels the masters of vessels to provide lockers. Why should we dare to do this? There is nothing in section 51 of the Constitution providing for that. Why, then, should we do it? The answer is that we are going to pay for it. In this particular matter, too, we are going to pay. Clause 17 makes all th provision that is really necessary and 'it seems to me that some senators have an exalted idea of their position in respect to the several States which they represent.' They have lost sight of the fact that they are here - even although they are called State representatives - as representatives of the Commonwealth pf Australia. Their first duty is to consider the rights, requirements, and interests of the Commonwealth, and after that, the necessities of the States which they represent. They are here to see that no one State imposes on another, and this very clause will prevent anything of that kind occurring ? Here we have a power vested in the Postmaster-General' in connexion with the conveyance of mails. If Western Australia, South Australia, or Queensland likes to become stubborn and refuse to do anything in the matter, would not that be to the injury of all the rest of the States - to the injury of the Commonwealth - and are we to put it within the power of one State to interrupt the whole machinery of government in connexion with postal matters ? We ought to give exclusive power, but still we ought to provide that ample payment should be made. In reference to the latter portion of the clause, I would ask what does the expense to which the Railways Commissioner is put in providing conveniences matter, if these tilings are taken into consideration, either in the arrangements between the Postmaster-General and that officer, or in the arbitration court, which settles the dispute afterwards ? I hope honorable senators will lose sight of these very grave .State interests and look more to the interests of the Commonwealth, which .are the interests of the whole of Australia, and act sensibly by supporting the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I will not occupy the time of the committee many minutes. I only rise because it appears to me from the remarks of the last honorable speaker that this is apparently a fight between lawyers and common sense. I may be allowed to say that I consider the definition of law given by Edmund Burke to be the true one - namely, that it is " the crystallization of the common sense of ages." There cannot be the slightest doubt in any one's mind that this is a very useful and very expedient clause. I do not think the difference is in reference to whether the clause in its present form is good or bad. It is a question of whether it is legal or not. At first I was very much impressed by the arguments adduced during the second reading. It did then seem to me' that, as we have a written Constitution limiting our powers, and as the railways, except for naval and military purposes, are excluded from those subjects upon which we can pass laws, we were going outside our constitutional rights in doing' anything which interfered with the control of the railways other than for naval and military purposes. It also seemed to me that any control is a limitation upon the exercise of rights ; that it is the right of a railway company, or of a railway department, to charge whatever fares they wish, and that therefore it is a limitation upon the exercise of that light to say " You shall charge the rates that are pleasing to me, and the rates that may seem fit to the Treasurer." On further consideration I have been converted from that view. I am perfectly satisfied now that the right here given is one incidental to the carrying out of the postal service. We must clothe the Postmaster-General with all the powers that are necessary, and one of the most immediate powers is the right to control, as it seems fit, the various carrying instruments throughout the country. I shall therefore vote with the Government for the retention of this clause. </para>

                    <para>- There was no subject, I think, at the time when the drafting committee of the Convention were engaged' in drawing up the Bill, that caused more anxiety than the question of whether precise words or general words should be used. It is perfectly clear that our Constitution was framed to a large extent by analogy with the American Constitution, and we came to the conclusion that the broader and more general the words used the greater would be their scope ; that if we once became too specific we should have a loophole left for an ingenious person to creep out of. We therefore assumed that the analogy of the American decisions would be followed, and that broad general words would cover everything. And so we advised the Convention, and so the Convention passed the Constitution in its present form, perfectly satisfied that these words covered everything, whether public railways or private railways or any other means of carriage. We thought, to use the expression of some honorable senators, that it would give the Parliament a general "commandeering" power. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, all of them. The words give Parliament the power - if you please to call it so - the commandeering power. I do not object to the term. The broadest words that could possibly be used are the words which are used, and if they can govern the public railways they can govern private railways. Although at the time of the passing of the American Constitution steam power had not come into effect, and railways were not in existence as now, the principles are eternally the same, whatever the means of carriage may be. To avoid the differentiation we knew might arise from the use of more precise terms we used general terms. The Convention adopted them, on the same understanding, and the Imperial Government passed the Act on the same understanding : that those general words covered everything, and gave the power of commanding every means of locomotion, for the purpose of carrying our mails, that happen to be at our disposal. I am entirely with the Government. </para>

                        <para>- That would be a very important element in deciding what would be paid for the carriage of the mails. Where a private company has agreed to carry the mails of the State free, it would, I take it, receive a mere nominal payment. In any case, if that company were not satisfied with a nominal payment, I should think that at arbitration the fact that the company had agreed to carry the mails free would be taken into consideration, and it would not get more than a nominal payment. It is not quite clear to me because that right was reserved under the State Act that the Federal Parliament could insist on the mails being carried free. It would be open for a private company to contend that their contract was to carry the mails of the State free, and they might be able to contend that, owing to federation, the expansion of business, and so on, the mails were heavier than they would have been if federation had not taken place. There may not be much in that, but they could put forward the contention that we should not have power to place ourselves, as it were, in the position of the State, and insist upon the free carriage of mails. </para>

                    <para>- This Bill provides for arbitration, but if we have the right to interfere with their mode of carrying on business, and to say - "You shall carry these mails whether you like it or not," be it public company or private individuals, you can say to these individuals - " You shall carry them free," just as you can say - "You shall carry them for reward." I should like to point out to the Senate what it is really doing. The case that my honorable friend has cited says that the Government has the right to the use of the roads for the purpose of carrying the mails, but no case on earth has ever said that the Government can come to me and demand my vehicles for the carriage of the mails. If I have a line from Kalgoorlie to Kanowna, or anywhere else, what power is there under the Constitution for the Commonwealth Parliament to come to me and say, " Carry the mails of" the Government because it is convenient that the Government should have their mails carried by your vehicles"? The Postmaster-General must draw a distinction between the power to use the territory of the State - namely, the roads - for the purpose of carrying mails and the power to compel private individuals to carry mails. Because, if we can say to a railway company, "carry the Commonwealth mails," we can say to the person driving his own trap, "carry the Commonwealth mails." I see no distinction whatever in principle. </para>

We do not claim that we can compel Wm to carry the mails, for the simple reason that we can run our own mail-carts. The reason of this special power is .that the railways exercise certain powers which are in the nature of a monopoly, and which prevents a similar service being carried out on those lines. We cannot run a train of our own over the -railways, and therefore we claim that those railways shall carry our mails. With regard to the carriage of mails by road, we do not want to commandeer the carts of any one when we can run carts of our own. </para>

                        <para>- I think that gives the Postmaster-General the necessary power. As regards private railways, I understand that in return for the concession given to them they agree to carry the mails. I was under the impression that when the Commonwealth took over the Postal department it took over those rights. If that is so, I do not see that there is any room for a d difference of opinion on-the matter. I hold that the Commonwealth has all the necessary rights and privileges handed over to them when carrying out the work of the department. Therefore, as far as I can see, we are only wasting time and debating a thing which every one sees very clearly. </para>

                    It struck me that something more was necessary than a simple mention of the word arbitration, and perhaps it would be as well to put in the clause that arbitration shall be in accordance' with the laws of the State.

                        <para>- I have some doubt whether we can do that. In any case, it seems to me that the term "-His Majesty's mails " is open to a misconstruction. The same term may have been used in the State Act, but the mails referred to are the State and not Federal mails. The Act of Parliament provides that they shall cany Her Majesty's mails free, which would mean the State mails. If w? use the words " His Majesty's mails"' in this Bill, it means the mails of the Commonwealth, and the owner of the private railway might very well say - " I did not agree at the time I got these powers from Parliament, and made this railway, to carry the Commonwealth mails." </para>

                        <para>- It might or might not be. He might argue that since federation the mails had become more heavy, and that that was not what he contracted to do. I think the better way is to leave the clause as it stands, because if a contract of that character has been made with the State to carry the mails free, then a mere nominal payment, I should say, would be sufficient. If the contractor is not satisfied with that, and wants to arbitrate, I should think any sensible men acting as arbitrators would say - " You agreed to cany the mails of the State at the time you got your powers, and it is no very great hardship now for you to be required to carry His Majesty's mails for the Commonwealth at a small remuneration." </para>

There would have been the same increase in the mails of a State without federation as there will be with it. . But undoubtedly the private railway owners expected that Her Majesty's mails would increase as time went on. What I object to is opening the door to any private railway company to consider that it is entitled to get a payment from the Commonwealth for carrying the mails, and perhaps dragging the case into the arbitration court and putting the Federal Government to considerable expense. I am sure that the terms used in private railway Acts are the terms which I have adopted in my amendment, inasmuch as when Her Majesty passed away His Majesty took her place.

                    <para>- I agree that with companies that agreed to carry mails free for the privilege of building a railway, it is right enough; but there will be great changes, and there are changes going on now whereby lines that are now only carrying a bag or two may carry tons upon tons of mails. In my mind's eye I can see great changes taking place within a period of years in the way in which mails are to be carried across this continent. It would hardly be fair to make a private company carry tons and tons of mails where now they carry only perhaps a couple of small bags. It is not right to make a hard and fast rule. I agree with the principle of the .amendment, but I hold that if we make a hard and fast rule we may unwittingly be doing an injury. </para>

                    but he has made a very great mistake to my way of thinking. He says that some of these companies that gob a concession from the State Governments, and agreed to carry the mails for nothing, only contemplated carrying a bag or two, but now it might have tons and tons of mails to carry. Does not every honorable senator know that when any such company has tons and tons of mails to carry instead of a bag or two, its profits have gone up 100 per cent., and it is reaping 100 times the advantage it reaped when it was. only carrying a bag or two of mails?'
                    said that we may have tons and tons of mails going across the continent.

                        <para>- I have been in i good many places and seen a good many of these railways, but I know that not one of them is of an Inter-State character. They are all railways run from a place to some mining settlement or something of that description, and if there never had been a federation the same likelihood of development or retrogression would have been possible as there is now. Some of these mining establishments will go on and prosper ; some of them will retrograde ; but that will have nothing to do with the Commonwealth. As these lines are in a particular State, and will only have to carry State mails between certain localities in that State, then where does the injustice of the amendment come in? And as regards the increase of the mail matter, I consider that the company can well afford to carry an increased quantity, because that would be the greatest sign of prosperity. </para>

The concession that was granted to them by the State, and what they give the State in return, the Commonwealth has a right to. As
                    has said, if any one has a right to a return for a concession of that description it is the State which gave the concession, not the company which got the concession for something which they  considered of some value, else  they  would never have constructed the railway.

                <para>
                    (Queensland). - I do not agree with the proposal that this question should be considered hereafter, especially when we have spent so long in arriving at our present state of mind. I have here a volume containing the Acts passed by the Queensland Parliament last year. There is, for example, the Callide Creek Railway Act. The company obtained certain privileges and concessions which some of -us thought were worth a considerable sum. Clause 32 , of that -Act states that the company shall carry upon its railway free of charge and with reasonable despatch all such persons and mails as the commissioner from time to time requires to be conveyed upon the public service, and shall allow to all members of the several Parliaments of Australia the same privileges of travelling over the said railway free, as are enjoyed by them on other railways. The same clause appears in the Glasford Creek Tramway Act, and also in the Mount Garnet Company's Railway Act. If we do not insert a provision at the end of the clause prohibiting a company from getting any payment for the carriage of mails they will make a charge, and this charge, I think, will be settled against the Government. If honorable senators had been in the Queensland Parliament at the time, they would have seen a very powerful opposition contending for days against giving these private railway companies power to construct railways at all. The provision I have mentioned was one of the several advantages advocated by the promoters of these lines as a reason why we should abandon the principle of State ownership of railways. I hope the Senate will carry the amendment.

                        <para>- I cannot see anything wrong with it. If we call this a regulation, the question arises as to what power we have to make regulations. The only power to make regulations is contained in clause 91. I propose that the fixing of rates shall not be done by regulation. The Governor-General can fix the rates. The rates, when fixed, are embodied in a schedule, and the schedule is laid upon the table of the House. </para>

                    <para>- The point is as to how the rate should be fixed. I understand that under clause 91 rates of a certain kind are fixed by regulation, and it would be well to have uniformity. If before the word " fix " the words "by regulation" were inserted it would really be done by regulation. Then in sub-clause (2), instead of saying " schedule of such rates " the use of the words "the regulations fixing such fees" would carry out what we desire. " Schedule " is rather an inappropriate expression. </para>

That is really why I would strongly urge the Senate to adopt my suggestion. It has always appeared to me to be the usual plan to state that the Governor in Council may pass regulations, may make regulations for so and so, and then to provide subsequently that these regulations shall be laid upon the table of the House.

                        <para>- Has not the honorable senator got a copy of the amendments ?' They have been circulated. I will read the amendments as they have been printed, so that the Senate may see what will be their effect. I propose to leave out the words I mentioned, and then to substitute "scale" for " schedule " and "charges" for "fees." Then in sub-clause (2) I propose to insert after the word " Parliament," line 12 - </para>

                    (South Australia). - I should like either
                    or some other honorable senator who has a preference for this " scaley " term, to tell us of its advantages. I do not like it. I think the word " schedule " is most appropriate. We hear of schedules of prices, and schedules of this thing and the other,but we never hear of a scale without making us shiver - at least it makes any one shiver who has anything to do with growing oranges, or citrus fruits of some kind. Without some very good reason, we should not make this alteration. When we make an amendment it should be to make an improvement, and if no one can show that the word "scale" is an improvement on "schedule," then, of course, we should not make the alteration. No one has* done so, and I think that " schedule " is the most commercial term to use.

                    <para>- Inthisclause.it is provided that seamen shall have certain privileges in regard to postage, and as far as the land service is concerned, that is extended to noncommissioned officers and men. The petty officer is in the same position as a non-commissioned officer in the land service, and I presume it is intended to give the same convenience to the same class of men at sea as to those in the land service. Therefore, the word " seaman" should be struck out, with a view to inserting the words " any petty officer or seaman " ; then both ranks would be on exactly the same footing in both branches of the service. </para>

                    <para>- The only objection that I can urge to altering this clause is that I believe it is a clause which is to be found in the British Postal Act, and I think in nearly all the Acts in His Majesty's dominions. I was just looking for it in the Victorian Act, but do not see it at the moment. I have no doubt it is there. The. object, of course, is to insure that these letters shall be carried at a uniform charge to sailors and soldiers wherever they may be in British dominions, and it is desirable, in order to insure uniformity, that the clauses shall be identically the same in each of the Acts. </para>

                        <para>- The wording of this clause is more stringent than the New South Wales Act in regard to what are papers, and I think we might at least alter the term " seven days " to " one calendar month," so that magazines may be placed on the same footing as ordinary newspapers. </para>

                    <para>- I was about to call the attention of the Senate to the same difficulty, and I therefore rise to second the amendment. I think the old custom that has been general throughout the State should still be maintained, and for the same reason as the mover I hope the amendment will be agreed to. It will not affect the revenue of the Postal department to an enormous extent, and I think it is a benefit which, if we possibly can, we ought to confer on the people. </para>

                <para>
                    (South Australia). - I am sure the Postmaster-General must see that he will be penalizing a certain class of persons who are publishing a newspaper, and also their rights, because they are really too poor to publish weekly instead of monthly. There are numbers of persons who are concerned. For instance, in South Australia the Temperance Alliance has a newspaper published once a month. It appeals to a certain class, and I believe it has a very large class of readers too. It would be too costly for the Temperance Alliance to publish weekly. If they could afford to publish weekly it would be carried at this low rate.

                    <para>- I am opposed to this amendment. It" seems to me" that the line must be drawn somewhere between newspapers and books. The idea originally, I suppose, in giving this concession to newspapers was that it was thought advisable that persons should be facilitated in the receipt of ordinary up-to-date news. No more. It was intended to apply to the daily journals and the weekly journals which- are a. summing up of the political and other general newsy statements of the week. AVe must draw the line somewhere, and the Bill is aimed at giving the concession to what are newspapers in the generally-accepted sense of the word. Could any one say that a periodical which comes out once a month isa newspaper in the generally-accepted sense of the term ? </para>

                        <para>- It is a monthly. No one could have the faintest chance of hoping to sell a monthly publication which was a statement or a collection of the ordinary affairs going on in the political, in the social, and in the commercial world. I am not saying at all that the concession is more justly applied to one than to the other; in fact, I am at a loss to see why there should be any such concession at all. On reading the clause, it appears to me that the concession is aimed at newspapers in the generally accepted sense of the word. Now, what I understand, and what I think every one understands, by a newspaper in the generally accepted sense of the word is a sheet which contains a summary of things going on around us and observations upon them. It is a matter of degree - two days are not one day, nor ten days two days. AVe must take a common sense line. A week, I think, is the furthest that we can ex- , tend it to, and mainly for the reason that a weekly publication is a summing up of the records of the preceding days. A great number of journals have their weekly editions, which are realty nothing more than a precis of what has been stated in the daily publications for the previous six days. Once we get beyond a week, and come to such a period as a month; no one could have the faintest hope of selling such a publication that had to do with the passing of current events. The only chance which the publisher of a monthly journal has of selling it is that it contains literary matter; essays upon things and scientific topics are dealt with. No one reads a paper which comes out so rarely as once a month for the purpose of getting an impress of the daily events that are taking place. A man reads such a journal for the purpose of educating himself upon some special topic. The question is whether we should allow a concession, which is aimed at newspapers in the generally accepted sense of the word, to include a journal that cannot be a newspaper in any sense of the word, since its only chance of existing is to avoid the matter upon which a daily newspaper lives - namely, daily topics. A magazine must live upon literary, scientific, and polemical articles. It is a newspaper that is to get the concession, not a periodical. That seems to me to be the logical distinction between the two. There is also another commercial observation, and it is this : When we have a journal coming out so rarely as once a month it necessarily is bulky ; it cannot consist of two or three sheets- This concession was originally aimed at newspapers, because they were lighter than periodicals, and easily conveyed. Therefore, it was not thought a very great deal to give this privilege. But it will be another thing to extend it to periodicals, which can grow to a huge volume. AVe have a limitation upon the growth of a newspaper. No newspaper can be bigger than would enable an ordinary person to read it at breakfast, and no newspaper can contain more -than the telegrams which the press agency supplies it with. There would be no limitation to the size of periodicals, and to extend this concession to them would open up great liability to abuse, and would be very hard on the commercial side of the Post-office. </para>

                        <para>- It is getting rather late, and I do not propose to deal definitely with this clause to-night. I would just like to say that the debate seems to have proceeded so far upon the assumption that if this limitation remain it is probable that all these monthly journals will be thrown out of the class of newspapers, and will be charged henceforward as printed matter. I should like to say here that my desire and intention is to draw up and make a separate class and rate for monthly publications. I shall try to come prepared to-morrow with an amendment to show how that can be carried out. I desire to say, also, that there is no wish to place the proprietor of any periodical at a disadvantage in consequence of this change, unless it is unavoidable. Of course, when we alter a rate the result must be a little inconvenience to the person who has to pay that rate. But there must be a time for it to come into force. With regard to the contention that contracts have been made on the present rate of postage, I would point out that this Bill will not come into operation until the 1st October next, and it is after that date that these rates have to be fixed. Probably they will not come into operation immediately. In that case I think we can arrange so that there will be no very great loss to any proprietor who previously has been in the habit of having his publication sent through the post as a newspaper. </para>
