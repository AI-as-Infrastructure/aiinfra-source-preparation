                    <para>- Who is to determine whether a work is an infringement or appears to be an infringement of a copyright? Is that to be left to the collector or some official of the department, or is a literary expert to be called in? There is nothing in the world more open to question than the originality or otherwise of literary work. The paragraph at present appears either useless or mischievous, and ought to be made a little clearer by designating some authority to decide as to an alleged infringement. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot consent to the amendment, because it would impose a duty on the Customs officials which, it is quite clear, they would not be able to adequately carry out under existing laws. There is a great difference between enforcing laws of copyright and aiding other nations to enforce such laws, and using the Customs for that purpose. That might very well be done by international arrangement, but to carry the amendment would make it necessary for the Customs officials to have all the copyright laws in every part of the world at their fingers' ends, in order that they might form some judgment as to the claims made. British copyright is something that can be known to all the officials, seeing that there is a register of all copyrights ; and in the paragraph we are only following what is provided in every Customs Act in Australia. If any reason could be given for the departure, I would be willing to assent to it, so long as it did not entail on Customs officials duties they cannot carry out. </para>

                    <para>- There is a practical reason why this or some similar paragraph should be in. the Customs Bill. First of all, it has been the practice to have such a provision in all Customs Acts, including the English Act. Bearing in mind that all goods coming into-' the State first come under the knowledge and purview of the Customs, surely the officers should have power to stop pirated, editions at the outset, instead of letting them flood the market to the injury qf legitimate publishers, who would then have to take action under some State or Commonwealth Act. I do not know that in the past any evil effects have arisen from; the application of the sections in the local Acts. I certainly notice, however, that the wording of the paragraph is different, and somewhat wider, than that of the Victorian Act. </para>

                        <para>- There is an enormous loss in weight through the abrasion of coin, and we send home some £60,000 or £70,000 worth of light silver coin every year, and get good silver for it again. As we know, the shilling is intrinsically not worth more than 7d. at the outside. If we are going to coin our own silver and make the profit which is thus to be obtained, we must be prepared to withdraw coins when they are below the standard weight. And when such light Australian coins are sent back here to be re-minted, surely we are not going to punish those who send them back ? I suggest that there should be added to the paragraph the words - "Excepting light coins withdrawable from circulation by Australian mints." </para>

                    <para>- The paragraph as it stands prohibits any One :from importing the coin df any country that :is not of the proper standard in weight or fineness. I would like to know if it is intended to exclude coins from every part of the world, because if it is, one who is a collector of ancient coins may render himself liable to a penalty of £100 if he imports coins that are not of the proper standard in weight or fineness. I submit that the paragraph might well be amended by inserting after the word " coin " the words - " of the realm or of any British possession." I think </para>

Thus we shall be handicapping British money. It seems to me that the Collector of Customs, in drafting the paragraph as it stands in the Bill, made it as wide as he could, in order tha,t no advantage should be given to the foreigner over the Briton. </para>

                    <para>- I desire the omission of this paragraph, not because I' approve of the importation of articles or works of the character mentioned,, but because I do not think the power of saying what works or articles are blasphemous, indecent, or obscene should lie with an officer of the Customs. If any importer brings such articles into the Commonwealth, let him be prosecuted in the ordinary way before the courts of the country, and let it be decided by the Judges whether the articles complained of do come within that category. Articles will be prohibited under the paragraph as blasphemous, indecent, or obscene just as the collector for the time being thinks fit. He may be a man of very puritanical ideas, -and will draw. the line very rigidly, or he may be the opposite, and go to the other extreme. </para>

                        <para>- This clause declares these goods to be prohibited, and under it the officer who may be in charge of the landing of the goods is directly given the power to seize them, and once it appears that they are prohibited goods, they may be forfeited under clause 220. The first question to be settled is whether these are prohibited imports or not, and somebody must judge whether they are to be allowed to go through. That somebody is the officer who ' happens to be in charge of the landing, and he judges subject to the supervision of his superior. Clause 197 and subsequent clauses are inserted for the protection of persons whose goods are seized. If a claim be made by the owner of the goods, the matter goes before the comptroller, who may give up the goods on obtaining security for their value in case of condemnation, or he may give them up altogether if he be satisfied that the officer has not acted properly. That being so, the matter can be brought before the court, to finally determine who is right and who is wrong. In the case of prohibited imports, action has to be taken immediately, and it must be left to the officer in charge to determine whether or not the goods are to be seized ; but there is ample opportunity for the owner of the goods to make his claim, and have his case brought before the comptroller, and, if he chooses, to appeal to the court. </para>

There will then be no opportunity for the owner of the goods to get damages, because the officer in all probability will be a man without means to satisfy a judgment. It is just as well we should have a little more light on the matter before we pass this particular portion of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Where the penalty is not sought, notice is given to the owner of the forfeiture of the goods, and he may put in his claim for them, as not being prohibited goods. The collector will then investigate the matter, and may either not press it any further, or may give up the goods and take security for them. Or the collector may tell the claimant to bring an action, thus throwing on him the obligation of seeking to recover his goods in the ordinary way. In this way the matter will again come before the court for decision : and the man may recover his goods without compensation. Or he may claim that there has been an unjust seizure, and bring an action for compensation. Then, if the Customs officer had acted unreasonably or improperly, and exceeded his duty, he will be liable to damages ; but it would be a question for the Minister to decide whether the department should pay the damages given against the officer or leave him to pay the damages himself. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that honorable senators are making efforts to protect a man who has defrauded the revenue. It is idle to contend that prohibited goods would not be prohibited within the knowledge of an importer. These importers, as a rule, know perfectly well what they are doing, and if they bring into this country goods which are prohibited by Act of Parliament, I hold that they are properly subject to penalties, and that we should not waste the time of the country in debating an amendment that would give them an opportunity of escaping the retribution which should follow upon an illegal act. I could understand protests being made if the importers did not know that the goods were prohibited. It is all very well to say that a man could appeal to the court. This community, however, does not exist for the benefit of the courts : the courts exist for the community. It is a misfortune for any man to be dragged there. The Government are to be commended for protecting the public as they propose. If a man commits a breach of the law he should be punished for it. We are here to protect, not guilty people, but the innocent ; and if a man introduces into a community goods that he knows very well he has no right to introduce he is deserving of the pains and penalties which attach to that conduct. </para>

                    <para>- This amendment is a proof of the possibility of carrying philanthropy too far. Surely the honorable senator who moves it cannot argue that it is a fair thing that the working people of the Commonwealth should have to enter into competition with prison labour in America, Great Britain, India, or anywhere else, in connexion with the manufacture of boots and shoes, saddlery, or furniture of various kinds, which are" made in prisons. If this is the sort of competition the honorable senator wishes the working people of the Commonwealth to engage in, it is philanthropy and free-trade unmuzzled. I hope the amendment will not be pressed, and, if it is, it will be the duty of the Senate to reject it. </para>

                        <para>- It is impossible to provide in the Act for every step which is to be taken in connexion with every matter of administration. We must rely on the officers to carry out their duty according to the spirit of the Act. We must rely on the power of the Minister to make regulations for carrying it out, and for any matters which cannot be detailed in the Act itself. The operation of the Bill will be in the hands of persons specially skilled, and who have been carrying out work of the kind for years. Because we do not find every step detailed in the Bill, it is not to be supposed that there are therefore defects in it, or that there is any necessity to provide for everything in the Bill. In respect to tea, the officer in charge of the ship, or of the wharf, will, in the first instance, judge for himself ; and if the tea obviously comes within this paragraph, he will act upon his own responsibility. If there is any doubt on the subject, there is an expert analyst connected with the department to whom samples will be submitted, and the department will act upon his report. The honorable senator may be assured that if this power is given to the officials there will be provision made by regulation, and by the ordinary administration of the department, for carrying out the work properly. If it is not carried out properly the department will be in the same position as any other department which is subject to the criticism of Parliament, of the press, and of public opinion in a variety of ways. It is only in that way that the efficiency of administration can be secured inall departments. </para>

                        <para>- The Government after full consideration, and, after consultation with their own officers, and with full knowledge of the Victorian law, deliberately omitted such a sub-clause as this. The Government may have found that an amendment of the kind was agreeable to a majority then in the House, or may have accepted it for some other reason ; but when we, having brought our independence and unfettered judgment to bear on the Bill, suggest that the sub-clause should be withdrawn, we may fairly expect the representative of the Government to meet us in this matter, unless he has a good and sufficient reason to justify a refusal. </para>

                <para>Oleomargarine, butterine, Dutch butter, butterine, edible fat. and similar appellations all denote different varieties of a manufactured article made expressly to imitate butter. It is an important industry in the States, and is also largely produced in Holland (hence the name of Dutch flutter) and in Belgium. As manufactured in Chicago it would appear to be at all events a cleanly article. Animal life is plentiful in the States. American technical operations are on a gigantic scale, and too much capital is involved hi the matter to allow of any process likely to disgust the consumers. The chief constituent used is beef fat, which consists for the most part of stearin-margarine (so called) and olein. .The olein and margarine melt at a much lower temperature than the stearin. Mutton fat contains more stearin than beef fat : hence in summer the softness of beef dripping as compared with the solidity of mutton fat. </para>

                <para>The oleomargarine is at this stage quite tasteless, and has no flavour of butter. This flavour is given by churning it with milk ; lastly, the product is coloured with an at to and rolled with ice, after which it is either made up into pounds, or packed into kegs for export. Arrived in this country, it is either sold honestly as margarine at the price of about a shilling a pound ; fraudulently, at a higher price as butter, or it is used as an adulterant of butter. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry to hear that, because my experience has been much happier. If we want to prevent fraud, ample means are provided, and when we are dealing with the Customs, let us confine ourselves to. Customs matters. If we exclude oleomargarine, we might just as well say that because Worcester sauce is adulterated, as every one admits it is, it should be excluded from the Commonwealth, that because whisky can be adulterated we should exclude it from the Commonwealth of Australia. In the opinion of most it is desirable that the people of this country shall get cheap food. But the object of the Customs Act is not to secure that end, but to prevent the defrauding of the revenue, and to provide for the administration of the department. The moment we go outside that object we depart from the honest and reasonable scope of a customs law, and endeavour by an indirect method to make a law which the committee should not enforce upon the community. </para>

                        <para>- Suppose the regulations provided that margarine should be coloured pink. We do not want to injure the trade in margarine. All that is required is to prevent it being sold as butter or mixed with butter. As the words of the Victorian Act have stood the test of eight years, and are copied from the Imperial Act, surely they ought to be sufficient to provide that margarine shall not be imported being the colour of butter, or in any way resembling butter. So long as we say that margarine shall not be coloured to imitate butter we carry out what the committee want. The Victorian provision has been proved to be absolutely safe and efficient, and it will be better to adopt it than the words proposed. </para>

                        <para>- The power for the benefit of the people is vested in the Executive. The honorable senator also seems to forget that it is necessary in a hundred ways to intrust very large powers to the Executive as representing the people - powers which may be exercised at any moment, and which can be used for the benefit of the community only if they are exercised at the particular time. Our Constitution is not so absurdly impracticable as to leave the Executive Government in the position of not being able to do what may be urgent for the benefit or saving of the community from some injury, simply because Parliament does not happen to be sitting, and there is no power to summon Parliament. What is the whole theory and principle of responsible government? In regard to certain matters of general application, laws can be made which must be followed by the Government as by any other portion of the community; but there are certain powers which have to be exercised outside of these Acts, and which must be exercised by the Executive. How does the Executive exercise those powers? Surely under the control of Parliament, and it is always open to Parliament to question the exercise of those powers. </para>

                        <para>- I can mention several. It will be admitted that circumstances might arise which would make it extremely undesirable to have an importation of arms or ammunition into the Commonwealth. It might come to the ears of the Government that arms and ammunition were being imported in such a way as to be a menace to public safety. What power would there be to prevent that importation if there were not a provision of this kind ? Such a contingency cannot be anticipated, and put into a Bill like this. Then, again, a certain description of drug might be suddenly introduced which was not contemplated in any of the clauses, but which might be distinctly harmful to the community. Are we to wait until we have time to get an Act through Parliament before any action is taken, while in the meantime the country might be flooded with some import which ought to have been stopped, and which Parliament itself would have consented to stop on the very threshold? This is exactly the same power as that which is vested in the Executive under a series of statutes which deal with the public health. Very large powers are given in regard to declaring what is an infected port, because it cannot be anticipated what an infected port is. We cannot lay down all the conditions which make an infected port, and, therefore, power is given to the Government to act in an emergency. </para>

                        <para>- I am dealing with the principle, and will come to the application of the principle to Acts of this kind in some of the States. There are various Acts which deal with the importation of diseased animals and stock. In the Queensland Act the Governor .in Council is given power to restrict or prohibit the importation of any stock or carcasses from such places beyond the colony, and at such times1 as may appear expedient. The whole matter is left at large as to the circumstances, time, and place. Do not let us play at responsible government. If we are to have responsible government, and a Ministry which can be unseated if it forfeits public confidence - if the power of scrutiny and criticism by Parliament is to be of any value - we must give the chief executive power to act under responsibility. We must not tie their hands in such a way that when the moment for action comes, it will be impossible for them to do something which should be done for the benefit of the community, and which must be done the moment when occasion arises. Sometimes it is found that diseases in fruit trees and other plants are spread .by importation from a particular quarter, and in some of the States there have been statutes passed only lately which give the Executive power to deal with matters of the kind. But there might not be such statutes, and, surely, it should be within the power of the Commonwealth Government, to stop at the very inception the importation of anything which might cause injury to the whole community," leaving Parliament to say afterwards whether the Government have exercised the power properly. I now come to the application of the power given in this very clause, and to show the reasons why the power is given. Officers of Customs are the officers and representatives of the Government, and although they act primarily and mainly in the collection of revenue, inasmuch as their opportunities enable them to stop the beginnings of danger to the community, they are vested with power to prevent the importation of the goods contemplated in the sub-clauses we have already dealt with. There are many other instances in. which it is necessary to exercise power in regard to matters which the Legislature has not thought of, because the Legislature cannot anticipate everything. There may be occasions in which this power should be and must be exercised - cases even more urgent than those we have already, dealt with ; and in several of the States that power has been given. But before going further, I would like to refer to the way in which the power is given in England. In the English Customs Act the- importation of arms, ammunition, gunpowder, or any other goods may be prohibited by proclamation or Order in Council. </para>

                    <para>- The difference between this and the other paragraphs is that, in respect to the articles referred to in the other paragraphs, the committee have decided that it is necessary that their prohibition shall not be left to the will of the Executive. We are of opinion, for instance, that the prohibition of the importation of exhausted tea should be dealt with, not by the Executive, but in an Act of Parliament. The two instances which have been quoted from the English Act referred to articles to the importation of which we have no objection at the present time, but circumstances may arise when we would feel that they ought not to be. introduced, and it would then be necessary that there should be some power to prohibit their introduction. </para>

                    <para>- The paragraph now before us appears to me to be one of the most objectionable of the many, in my opinion, objectionable provisions in the Bill. The power that it is sought to give to the Government is too widespread. It has been shown, and it cannot be denied by the Government, that the prohibition of the eight or nine articles referred to in the previous paragraphs of this clause could have been effected under this single paragraph, and there was no occasion for us to spend the afternoon in debating whether those items should be considered as prohibited imports. What more could any Government have or any Parliament give ? I cannot accede to such a power being given to any Government, and I cannot but express my surprise at any Government being willing to take such a power, should the Parliament be willing to give it. </para>

                    <para>- These words are necessary. I take it that the honorable senator assumes that it is necessary to have this power where there is a false suggestion of warranty on the goods themselves. What the honorable senator objects to is where the false suggestion is on something connected with the goods, or sent with the goods. The honorable senator must see that a false suggestion may be printed on the packet itself or outside a case or canister, or it may be that the false suggestion may not be on the goods in order to purposely evade the first part of the paragraph. There may be a wrapper outside the goods with nothing of the kind on it, while inside there may be the document or advertisement, whatever it is, carrying the false suggestion. Surely that would have the same effect as the other in creating a wrong impression by fraud, and why should not that be met. What objection can there be to strengthening the clause in order to carry out what the honorable senator will admit is a proper intention. I hope the honorable senator will see that it is necessary to preserve these words. </para>

Under the ordinary Custom-house laws the Government have quite enough power to prevent the introduction of cattle, and there is really no necessity for the paragraph. </para>

I understand that at the present time there is a good deal of difference in the temperature of the flash test in the different States. In some States the test is considerably below 100 degrees, although it is said that that is the limit of safety. I think that in Tasmania it is below 10 degrees. </para>

                        <para>- As improvements and inventions are continually being introduced, it would be much better to leave the temperature of the flash test, and also the mode of testing, to be prescribed by regulation. In the Victorian Act there is a most elaborate description of. the apparatus which has to be used for testing, but I understand that that apparatus has become quite inapplicable, having been superseded by some other appliance. If the proposed sub-clause be amended in such a way as to leave everything connected with the test to be prescribed by regulation, 'I shall have no objection to otter to it. </para>

                    <para>- I am well aware that restrictions on the size of packages have been very common in Customs Acts, but I think the time has come when Australia can afford to be a little more liberal, and do away with these extremely arbitrary requirements. We are accustomed to allow the importation of other goods in packages of the size the merchants find to be most convenient. Therefore, it does not appear to be right that the importers of opium, tobacco, snuff, cigars, and cigarettes should be bound down to import only in packages of a size prescribed by persons who are not in the trade, and cannot be as good judges as the merchants and importers themselves. There is no real reason for the retention of this provision, except that it has been to some extent consecrated by long usage. </para>

                    <para>- It maybe that there are very strong reasons why this clause should be retained in the form in which it stands in similar Acts. But what we want to do is to facilitate trade as far as we can, and unless there are good reasons there should not be any provision in the Bill providing that packages must be of a prescribed size, and that importers shall be liable to so serious a penalty as £100 in the event of their not obeying the strict letter of the law. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council can show valid reasons, no doubt there will be no difficulty with regard to retaining the clause, but in view of the desirability of facilitating trade as much as possible I am inclined to vote against it. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely. Seeing that there are serious differences between this clause and the existing Acts, it is worth our while to consider whether there are reasons for imposing a restriction in the proposed form. It is obvious that the clause does not contemplate the prevention of loss of revenue, nor is there anything in it to prevent smuggling. What it really does is to prevent any private individual from importing spirits, tobacco, cigars, snuff, or opium, however ready he may be to pay duty, unless he imports them in packages of the prescribed size. We do not know what the prescribed sizes will be. That is a matter for regulation. In nearly every Act that we can take for comparison the prescribed size has been specifically mentioned. In some cases it is provided that no individual may import tobacco of less weight than 40 lbs. </para>

                        <para>- In this case the size may be 100 lbs. This will simply have the effect of preventing private individuals from importing their own spirits and tobacco. The measure plays into the hands of the large importers. I happen to know of cases where supplies of cigars have been imported privately. In fact I personally have had the benefit of such importations ; but it is extremely doubtful whether I could get that benefit if this clause came into operation. Is it desirable to put such a restriction on private enterprise ? I cannot see any reason for departure from a procedure that has the sanction of every British community we know of. </para>

The minimum size of a package in one State may be 40 lbs., and in another 60 lbs., and it might easily be stated that 40 lbs. shall be the minimum size of a package for all Australia. I can see that some annoyance may arise if in some States the minimum size at present is 40 lbs., and we provide that for Australia the minimum shall be 50 lbs. </para>

The' Chambers of Commerce of the various States have not taken the slightest objection to this clause, and the various merchants who deal in these goods are perfectly content with it. I know that the Bill has been very closely scrutinized by those interested. With regard to the difficulties referred to by Senator Clemons, as a matter of fact I have imported to Victoria for my own use a few boxes of cigars, although the minimum is 10,000, and I have done the same in Canada and in England. There is really no difficulty in the matter. </para>

                    <para>- In paragraph (b) we have the words "answer questions," and in paragraph (c) the words " produce documents," and these two phrases are defined by the interpretation clause. It is a very unusual thing to have such words referred to in an interpretation clause for the express purpose, and that alone, of making the clause in which they are used briefer,and in that way for the sake of brevity, to sacrifice what is. more important, and that is accuracy. Very few people reading these expressions - " answer questions " and " produce documents " - would think of referring to the interpretation clause, and the phrases as they stand would ordinarily be accepted as complete. By a short amendment of this clause the interpretation clause may be relieved of the whole of the two paragraphs referring to these phrases. The terms " answer questions " and " produce documents " only occur some three times in the whole of the Bill, so that really no saving is gained by the lengthy paragraphs which appear in the interpretation clause.

                    <para>- I hope the honorable senator will not press the amendment. It is a mere matter of drafting, and the words which he refers to are really included by reference to the interpretation clause. It is quite true that this is a new method of drafting, but it is a most convenient one. Any persons sufficiently interested in the customs law to read clause 59 will certainly, or ought certainly, to read every portion of the Bill, which may be necessary to throw any light upon it. Can the honorable senator seriously say that it is any advantage to make the Bill longer by putting into this clause words which are already implied in the reference to the interpretation clause? </para>

The whole scheme of the drafting of the Bill is that these short phrases are to be used to save a repetition of the same words over and over again, and that there is to be a general interpretation of them. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the amendment is altogether unnecessary. It must not be forgotten, that it is the master of the ship that we are dealing with under this clause, and he will be thoroughly conversant with the duties imposed upon him under a Bill of this kind. When asked questions he will naturally be expected to give true answers. I rather like the draftsmanship of this Bill, which refers all the details as to penalties to the interpretation clause, thus doing away with the continual repetition of words. I hope the amendment will not be pressed. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt it is intended that the ship shall report at each port she comes into, and I think the clause had better be made clearer, in order to put the point beyond question. I propose, therefore, to insert the words " at any port." Coastal ships are dealt with separately in another part of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There is no doubt that wherever a ship arrives with a view of landing any goods at all, there ought to be a report, because the Customs officials ought to have control of the goods. The Customs officials have the light to inspect and know what goods are on board, and to compare the manifest with the goods. The shipmaster will have to report undoubtedly at every port at which the ship delivers any cargo or passengers. </para>
