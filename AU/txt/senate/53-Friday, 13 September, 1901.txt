                        <para>- It is the amount per head calculated upon the basis of the population of the whole Commonwealth. In order to see how this works out honorable senators will have to look at the next column. Take, for instance, the case of New South Wales. Here I may remark that in order to get the common denominator we have to take the lowest figure on the side of the amount to be received by the States. The lowest is £2-36, in the case of Victoria. It is obvious that we can deduct that from every figure on both sides. The operation of making the deduction will be to reduce the whole amount of the moneys payable to the States by the amount of £2-36 per head of the population. If honorable senators apply that rule they will find the effect shown in the next column. The compensation payable to New South Wales would be £3,200,000 j deducting £2-36 per head from that, we get £3,182,000. Then if honorable senators deduct the one total from the other they will find that the amount payable to New South Wales is £18,000, being the balance. In other words, instead of paying £3,200,000 on the one side and getting back £3,182,000 on the other, we perform this operation of striking out on both sides and leave the net amount to be paid to New South Wales at £18,000. In the same way take the case of Victoria. We deduct the same amount, £2.36, from Victoria, and that wipes out her claim completely. In the case of Queensland there is a balance left to be paid of £452,000 instead of £1,590,000. In the case of South Australia, instead of paying £1,665,000, by this calculation we bring out the amount payable to her at £790,000. In the same way we pay Tasmania £6,000 instead of £430,000, and to Western Australia we pay £405,000 instead of £809,000. That is the way in which this proposal will operate. I need hardly point out that it will be of immense importance if we can simplify the accounts between the Commonwealth and the different States ; and there is no reason in the world why these large amounts should be paid into one pocket and out of the other. If we can find a means of bringing out a result of this kind, I am sure that the committee will agree that it should be applied. Every safeguard is provided for full publicity, a copy of every such order of the Governor-General having to be laid before both Houses of Parliament. After the explanation which I have made, as concisely as possible, I leave this clause to the committee, believing that it is really a complete and practical way of working out the money relations between the Commonwealth and the States in regard to this matter of compensation. </para>

                    <para>- It is to be regretted that the proposal, which in itself is very important and I believe very valuable, has been made to us with so little time for weighing the matter involved. I also think it is a matter for regret that the proposal for the settlement of the value of the transferred services has not been placed before the various States. In July last, when this Bill came before the Senate, I asked whether the terms then proposed had been laid before the various States for their consideration. I was informed that that had not been done. Now there is another point. The committee will be aware that I have, on various occasions, been pressing upon the Government the importance of having the census returns with regard to several matters made complete. The desirability of having the census returns completed is shown when we come to consider the figures before us. The figures given in the calculations are those which were estimated as for the various States at the close of 1899. But the recent census returns have very considerably varied the relative positions of some of the States, and it is a pity that the Government did not take the latest approximate figures in drawing up these tables. </para>

                        <para>- I know; but I will show at once the effect of taking figures that have not been brought up to date. Last night I took the trouble of casting up some of these figures for myself. I took the census figures, and compared them with the tables presented by the Government. Take the case of Tasmania, where the difference is most noteworthy. The balance to be paid to Tasmania under table 3 is £6,000. The Tasmanian population has been very much over-estimated in the figures used by the Government. As the result of my calculation I found that a balance of £46,000 would be due to Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- Just so. Then I think the clause might be simplified a good deal if we were to take out the words "by the whole or a part of the amount which would be chargeable against those States respectively if the full amounts of compensation were paid by the Commonwealth." It appears to me that those words only confuse the meaning of the clause, and I cannot understand what they are in for. </para>

                        <para>- In the settlement of these money transactions between the States and the Commonwealth, the larger the discretion we can give to both sides the better. This is simply given as an option, and we may be very well assured that it is an option which will be exercised and applied. I do not think there is any necessity to make it compulsory or to make any distinction between the application in the case of transferred services and other cases. </para>

                        <para>- If they were wanted for seven or eight years they were wanted as permanent officers. The consequence has been that permanent officers who entered under the original Act, passed the necessary examinations, worked their way up step by step, doing their duty and earning promotion and increment of salary, found themselves suddenly blocked in their promotion by the incursion of a large number of temporary officers brought in by political influence, by Ministerial influence, and, I might also say, by the influence of heads of departments, which is just as bad as political influence. There they are, however, and in the meantime the regular officers are blocked. These four considerations alone will account naturally for a very large amount of dissatisfaction throughout the service. In addition I may say that it was anticipated, and it was stated at first that the reduction of salaries would extend only for a period of three years ; but that time was extended, I think to a most unfair degree. Then it might naturally be imagined that while all these changes were going on, and there was more or less irritation, an experienced Public Service Board would be retained in order to smooth over difficulties, and by their intimate knowledge assist in preventing undue friction. Unfortunately, the Ministry, with a view to economy - false economy, I think - pensioned off these three experienced public officers, and imposed the duty of administering the Public Service Act upon the Audit Commissioners, who knew nothing whatever about its intricacies. " They were suddenly called upon, at a most difficult period in the history of the service, to administer a more or less complicated measure. </para>

                        <para>- I have listened with some interest to the statements made with regard to the position of the service in South Australia. One would imagine that South Australia was another place in which none of these evils of Ministerial and political influence occur. We cannot shut our eyes, however, to the fact that rumours - whether true or not, I cannot say - are frequently heard of very high-handed action on the part of Ministers in the model state. </para>

                        <para>- That was not the fault of the Public Service Act. The New South Wales Act provides for a superannuation fund - which, by the way, was said some days ago to be pretty well insolvent - not for temporary officers, but for the permanent men of the service. It would have been monstrously unfair to make grants to these temporary officers out of a fund provided for the permanent men. </para>

It was resolved unanimously that the absolute control of officers in the various departments should no longer be left to Ministers. It could not be otherwise than that Ministers should be subject to the pressure of political influence. A Minister cannot refuse to see Members of Parliament or to hear them. </para>

                        <para>- I will give honorable senators my experience in connexion with one department. One of the regulations under the Public Service Act is that officials shall not communicate with Members of Parliament, and that Members of Parliament shall not bring influence to bear in connexion with the appointment or promotion of officers. At the time I am referring to that provision was a dead letter. When I took office - I was a young Minister, otherwise, perhaps, I should not have acted as I did. I had copies of these regulations printed. Whenever a Member of Parliament wrote to me requesting a favour for an officer, I sent him a courteous letter, enclosing a copy of the regulations, and asking whether he desired to injure the officer. In a number of cases members had the good sense to ask that their letters should be withdrawn ; but there is a class of members who would never dream of doing such a thing They will utilize all their power in favour of their supporters. What is the position of a Minister on the eve of an important division which may make or mar a Ministry? It is really unfair that he should be placed in such a position, and it is unfair also that Members of Parliament should be so situated simply because some of them insist upon breaking the law.

On the first Wednesday after the board was appointed there was perfect quietude over the departments - I fancy that I can feel the quietude even now- - and from that day until comparatively recently the public service was wonderfully improved upon what it had been.

                        <para>- No, a communication from an officer must go through the head of his department and not direct to the Minister, and then it has to be noted by the head and sent on to the Public Service Board. That system has gone on for a number of years. It has given the fullest satisfaction to the public service as a whole. Of course there are some men - I am glad to say, a minority - who look upon the public service as being made for them, and not they for it, and they are always trying to pull the strings in their own interests. I am glad to say, however, that they are quite the exception. I am not claiming for the public service of Victoria any more than other honorable senators can claim for the public service of their own State. But with an intimate knowledge pf the public service, I can say that until comparatively recently it was a credit to the State, and occupied such a position that we should do all we can in the Commonwealth to emulate that example. Exception has also been taken to the fact that transfers took place from one department to another, and, consequently, occasionally a round peg got put into a square hole. I grant that occasionally, but only very occasionally - it happened. We must bear in mind that nine-tenths of the work in the public service is of a similar character. lt is purely clerical, and a man after a few days experience can do the work just as well in one department as he can in another. What is the course of procedure in getting a vacancy filled in, say, the Post-office f A printed form is filled out by the Public Service Board, stating that there is a vacancy in such a department for a fourth-class officer at a certain salary and to discharge certain duties, and on the list, it is stated that the undermentioned officers are eligible for selection. Generally the names of about half-a-dozen officers are given. The form is sent round to the head of each department, and he is asked to state whether he has any officer after those six who, in his opinion, is qualified to discharge the duties. The heads fill up the forms, return their own opinion of the men, the Public Service Board recommends a certain officer to be transferred, and then an Order in Council is drawn up which, of course, the Minister has to sign. The Minister has nothing to do with the selection of the officer of whom he can know nothing. All he can do if, from any cause he thinks an injustice has been done, or an error has been made, is to refuse to sign the Order in Council. I have known one or two cases where that has happened, but they are very few and far between. </para>

A certain transfer has been recommended, the head of the department to which the officer is going has agreed to it, the board has approved, and the Minister - I have had my own colleagues to fight in some cases - has blocked it. Why? Because he had his friends to serve, and he has continued to block it. That is distinctly contrary to the A.ct, and if I were Premier when such a thing happened, either the Minister or I would have to resign. </para>

It is not possible in any legislation to provide for every case, Nor is it possible to provide in any Bill for practically an illegal act on the part of the Minister. A Minister is backed up by his colleagues, and if he lias a majority in Parliament, of course he is backed up there What is the good of coming to Parliament to complain in such circumstances ? </para>

                        <para>- That is an improvement. At some time or' other an independent board of three persons, commissioners, must be appointed, I am utterly against one commissioner, because that would be very nearly as bad, in my opinion, as to have the Minister. In time a perfectly independent board ma)' have to be appointed, perhaps during good behaviour, which would be better in many respects than for a term of seven years. But in the meantime we have taken over only the Post-office, the Customs, and the Defence department. We have three heads of departments, and while it will be necessary by-and-by to have permanently appointed and well-paid commissioners, as we have in Victoria, and I suppose elsewhere, I do not think it is necessary for us to go to that expense immediately. My own feeling is that we should go slowly, and that the permanent heads of the three departments might very well in the meantime be intrusted as a board with all these duties. </para>

                        <para>- It is a mistake. If we had taken over the whole of the departments, then of course we should have had to appoint a board just as in Victoria, but we took over only a portion of the departments, and although they represent in the aggregate a good many thousand officers, I am certain that with proper assistance given to the three permanent heads, they will have no difficulty in discharging these duties. There will not be in the meantime a large number of appointments to make. Probably there will be a good deal of work to do to get the civil servants put in their proper places. When an amalgamation is made there is always friction, and it .requires three men here with technical knowledge and practical common sense to get over the initial difficulties. </para>

                        <para>- That, I believe, is one of the first things which will have to be considered. There will be transfers, perhaps not to a very large extent, from one State to another, and that is exactly where the difficulty will arise. But there is no necessity to go to the expense of a commissioner and six inspectors to get rid of a difficulty of that sort, because the three permanent heads are ample. I strongly urge the Minister to give my suggestion a trial. Do not let us rush into a large expenditure, which I venture to say is not necessary in the meantime. It will be necessary by-and-by, but sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. </para>

                        <para>- Necessarily I know something about the heads of departments, and I know that there is not a single head in a commercial firm who, if you give him the assistance of a junior clerk to relieve him of the heavy work, and still more if you give him the assistance of a shorthand-writer - and shorthand writers are not by any means used sufficiently in the public service - could not get through three times the amount of work and with less trouble. Give the permanent heads a little assistance of that sort and I can assert within my own knowledge that they can do their work and do it satisfactorily, not only to the civil service as a whole, but also with credit to themselves. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator, who wants to see this Bill laid aside until next session, and says there is no necessity for such a measure, is not, if I may be excused for saying so, so well informed as to the state of the civil servants of Tasmania, or their status, as I am myself. Perhaps I have been brought more closely into contact with many of them than he has. I am satisfied that in the interests of the transferred civil servants of Tasmania there is great need for such a measure as this - a measure which will place them on an equal footing and give them an equal status with their fellow servants in other States. Does the honorable and learned senator mean to tell us that under the present system in Tasmania, where Ministerial responsibility exists, there is no social influence ? Surely he must be aware of the social influences at work in Tasmania to-day. Taking one part of Tasmania, I know of cases where civil servants in the Post and Telegraph department have been for ten years in the employ of the State; their efficiency has never been called in question, but they are only receiving at the very utmost about £120 per annum, whereas in Victoria officers who have had the same length of service, other things being equal, are receiving £220 a year. That is an instance showing the need for such a measure as this, which will bring uniformity into the ranks of the civil servants in each of the States. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator went further than that last night, because he wanted to shelve the whole Bill. Probably I am in unison with him to some extent with regard to clause 5. To show again the necessity for a measure which will give uniformity under regulations, if I read the Bill, aright, there will be a system of transfers from one part to another. That is very much needed in Tasmania. There are civil servants who have been living and working in one of the worst climates on the face of the earth for nine or ten years, and have never received one penny more per annum for having to live in that climate than has been received by men who have lived in the milder and more beautiful portions of the same State. </para>

                        <para>- No. As I have lived there for many years, perhaps I am justified in saying that I know of no worse climate in Australia than that of the West Coast of Tasmania. There the average number of days on which rain falls is 260 out of the 365, and we do not measure our rainfall by inches, but by feet. </para>

                        <para>- This Bill would remedy some of those grievances under which civil servants living in such a climate are now existing. At present the only benefit that any of the officers living in a certain part of that State derive from their long and faithful service there has been that they have got out of touch with the heads of departments, and have perhaps laid in the foundation for rheumatism and all kinds of lung complaints in the future. Under this Bill, many of those evils will be remedied. I do not mean to say for a moment that I think clause 5 is perfect. If any honorable senator during the course of this debate can show me - and I am open to conviction - a better method of controlling the public service, I am willing to accept it. </para>

                        <para>- Nor have we too many of them here. We have over 6,000 post and telegraph offices, and we have 218 Custom-houses. In addition to these there are the offices connected with the Marine department, which will shortly come under the control of the Commonwealth, and there are a considerable number of officers connected with the civil branch of the Defence department. I care not what great' abilities a Minister may possess, or however desirous he may be to discharge his duties to the full, and give satisfaction to all the officers in the various branches of the service, and to Parliament, it is absolutely impossible that he can do all that is required of him. There is no business in the world, and never will be, scattered over such a vast territory, and employing such a number of persons as are connected with the departments of the Commonwealth to which I have referred. Fancy asking a Minister to appoint a telegraph operator at Cammoweal in the far northern part of Queensland, or a message boy in the Northern Territory of South Australia ! It would be absolutely impracticable to cast upon him the responsibility of such appointments. </para>

But are those regulations framed on solid, equitable, just, and humane grounds ? If they are not, then I contend that the service will have a perfect right to demand an alteration of that which is manifestly cruel, unjust, and oppressive. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps some of the Members of Parliament were closely allied with that sort of thing. Members of Parliament are frequently asking Ministers to make appointments and transfers. Supposing that a member is successful in securing the appointments or transfers he desires, h he going to lash these Ministers as has been alleged ? Not at all. Members in such a position are absolutely silent, knowing full well that they have been largely responsible for the objectionable state of affairs. Those who have been instrumental in bringing about that condition of affairs are not going to rise in their places in Parliament and lash the Minister. The Minister would retaliate upon them with tremendous vigour. In Queensland an investigation of the public service was made some years ago, and, in one case, it was found that an officer had been employed for years in addressing envelopes at a salary of £300 a year. Members of Parliament are largely responsible for such a state of affairs, and to say that they would criticise Ministers in such circumstances is perfect nonsense. They would not dare to do so. </para>

Even in the model State of South Australia I fear bad appointments and transfers have been made. Supposing Ministers of the Crown are exceedingly strong, and can resist the pressure of political influence brought to bear on behalf of the civil service, what, may I ask, becomes of the 700,000 electors scattered throughout the Commonwealth - have they no voice in these matters ?

                        <para>- These requests are very natural, and it is hardly possible to avoid them. Some honorable senators would have this Bill hung up. They say it should be set aside for a year, while others wish to amend it in a way that would destroy its usefulness. We are all extremely anxious to see that close federation brought about which the people of Australia desire - this is One means of bringing it about. The Bill is framed on federal lines, and in such a way that every individual in the Commonwealth will have an equal right to enter the service. When a man does enter the service, he will have a free course open to him to advance according to his abilities under the provisions of this Bill. The Bill has been carefully drafted and framed, and it has passed the keenest possible criticism of 72 members of the other Chamber. Are we going to give no' heed to that fact? I admit that we have the right, but are we going to calmly set aside the work which has been done by the other House - by the assembly that holds the purse strings of the Commonwealth ? </para>

                        <para>- The other Chamber has passed the Bill in the shape in which it comes before us, and- has voted the money required for the payment of the commissioner and his inspectors. I think the number of inspectors proposed is not too great considering the enormous amount of work to be performed. We should not be mealy-mouthed about the matter. Considering that so many branches have been taken over, six inspectors are not too many. They have to travel over a vast territory, and examine a great number of officers. Is there any banking institution in the world, having branches scattered all over the country, that would not employ a sufficient number of inspectors to see' that those branches were being worked in a proper manner? Yet some honorable senators talk of the enormous expenditure that will be involved in the appointment of six inspectors at a salary of £800 per annum, and a commissioner at a salary of £1,500 per annum. Some honorable senators desire to leave the civil service to Ministerial control. We have 108 members of the Commonwealth, each of whom, no doubt, receives applications for civil service appointments from all parts of the States. Assuming that each member was successful in securing the appointment of ten persons in the service at a paltry salary of £100 a year, far more than what is asked for as the remuneration of these officers under this Bill would be swallowed up. Sixty-three officers at £100 a year each would swallow up what is proposed to be paid to the commissioner and his six inspectors. I believe that we shall prevent appointments and transfers resulting from political pressure by appointing a commissioner, and in that way we shall save five or six times as much as would be expended in paying the salaries of these seven officials. Supposing that we take these seven persons, the total expenditure comes to £6,300 a year. But supposing that we have an additional expenditure of £7,000 or £8,000 a year all told to pay for all the new appointments under this Bill, does any honorable senator imagine for a moment that the commissioner and the inspectors will not save more in the performance of their duties in a year than will cover that sum % If the commissioner is worth his salary, and if the inspectors are worth their salaries, they will save 20 times the amount they draw a year. </para>

                            <para>- In other Houses of Parliament in the States, and in America, these desks are in use. Any one who has been in the South Australian Assembly must have been struck with the accommodation there provided. A member can have at his desk his parliamentary papers and other documents to which it is necessary for him to refer during the course of a debate. I have seen members of this Chamber endeavouring to write legibly on the cushions and on their knees, and it appears to me that if it is found that this proposal would not entail a very large expenditure, the Senate might very well agree to it. I do not think it is necessary to discuss the matter at any length at this stage. When we have the estimated return before us, it may be necessary to collect a few facts to induce members opposed to the proposal to fall in with our views. </para>

                        <para>- No; it would be for better and more in consonance with the practice which characterizes proceedings of this kind, that the committee should attend and take evidence in Tasmania. It would be far more expensive to bring witnesses over here. Moreover, it is desirable, I think - and other members of the committee agree with me - that in investigating this matter the members of the committee should have an opportunity of personally testing the existing means of communication between Tasmania and the mainland, and have an opportunity for practical ocular observation of the conditions which prevail at the other end of the service. </para>
