                    <para>- This sub-clause has been discussed at considerable length, and I moved for its omission because we have provided in an earlier part of the clause for the appointment of the commissioner. By the omission of the sub-clause we should provide that his appointment should not be for a definite term. It is advisable that he should be appointed on the same terms as any other officer in the public service. I do not see why we should fix upon a particular term, seeing that it is quite an experiment whether he will be a success or not. We ought to go slowly and bo in a position to terminate the appointment if we think fit. </para>

                    <para>- I do not agree with the proposal to omit the sub-clause, nor do I agree with the suggestion that because this is experimental legislation we should not define the term of engagement of the commissioner and the inspectors. As it is very desirable to procure the services of competent persons to fill these important offices, security of tenure should be provided for. If the services of these officers can be dispensed with at any moment, I am convinced that the Government will not be able to secure the most competent men to fill the offices. But if we stipulate in the Bill that they shall have a fair trial and enjoy some security of tenure, in order that they may be in a position to put the departments into an efficient state, it will afford them an opportunity to display their ability and capacity. </para>

                        <para>- I do not place civil servants on the same plane as these officers. The commissioner should not come within the category of civil servants, nor should the inspectors who will be immediately under his supervision. The commissioner will be the head of the civil servants, and will hold the balance between the Parliament on one hand, and the Ministry . on the other. I do not place him in the same category as the head of the Customs or the Postal department. If we desire to secure the services of the most competent man we must provide for security of tenure. The most able man will not offer his services if the appointment is to be of a temporary nature. When a Commissioner for Railways is engaged in a State, he is placed for a term at the head of a number of civil servants, and is given an opportunity to put his department into an efficient state, and to prove his competency to discharge the duties of his office. I hope that the subclause will be retained. </para>

                        <para>- I know that if we allowed the public service to be controlled by Parliament, as it ought to be, there would be an appeal and inquiry if the Postmaster-General dismissed any one from the service. If the Postmaster-General's action could not be supported, then he would be held responsible, and his seat in the Ministry would be jeopardized.' If we are to have a large public service it is only fair that Parliament should have full control of it through the agency of its responsible Ministers. We should not vote for the appointment of a commissioner for any long term. The Postmaster-General has just stated that some of the States are dispensing with their Civil Service Board because they have handed over certain departments to the Commonwealth. They have handed over only two departments, and if they find a board unnecessary, why should we appoint a commissioner for a term of seven years ? There will be no equivalent for the expenditure involved. </para>

                    <para>- It appears to me that the Senate having decided that there shall be a commissioner, it is bound to follow up that decision by securing that officer against political influence. I can see a very wide distinction between the position of a commissioner and that of the inspectors. Whilst I am distinctly of opinion that the committee ought to insure the security of the commissioner, I think the inspectors should be placed on a footing entirely different. I shall, therefore, vote for a commissioner, but not for the inspectors, and when the matter of the tenure of office comes up, possibly the proposed term of seven years may be slightly reduced. </para>

                        <para>- In the majority of them. I am very glad to hear that there is at least one State where the people are such political purists that political influence is unknown. We have the unfortunate fact to face, however, that in the other States politicians have not been above suspicion to the same extent. In the majority of the States political influence in the public service has been so paramount that it has been found absolutely necessary to appoint public service boards to remove even the suspicion of patronage from the Ministry and Members of Parliament of the day. If we do not give the commissioner a certain tenure of office, it will be useless to appoint him. Some honorable senators desire that he shall be placed in the same position as any other member of the service. If the position of the commissioner were not unique, I should agree with them, but his office is different altogether from that of any other civil servant. Other members of the service have their specific duties to attend to, and they do not come into very serious conflict with the public or their fellow servants. A commissioner, however, has to reconcile differences between members of the service. He has to deal with the Ministry of the day, with Members of Parliament, and with every one within the bounds of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot enter into all these side issues. I am trying to prove why we should place the commissioner in an independent position. I believe in the system, and, unlike those who do not, I desire it to have a fair trial. Those who are opposed to the system wish to expose the commissioner to attack on every side. Imagine a commissioner who had no fixed tenure of office approached from the political, social, and, perhaps, from the monetary side. Some honorable senators may think these tilings are impossible, but nothing is impossible in this world, and we must provide for every contingency. If we desire good service from 'the commissioner, and a pure and well-conducted civil service, we should secure him from attack. Therefore, I am going to support the Government proposal. Seven years may be too long. I would not object to the term being fixed at five years, as it might act as a spur to the commissioner. It would place him in the same position as a Member of Parliament. If a Member of Parliament, is elected for seven years, he naturally falls into habits of indolence; but if his term of office is shortened by two years, it keeps a whip on his back, and, of course, if lie fails to do his duty, he is rejected when he appeals to his constituents. There is a great difference between a tenure of five years and no tenure at all. A person who is placed in a position of this kind ought to be appointed for a definite term. He may have some schemes in his mind's eye, and therefore he ought to be allowed sufficient time to perfect them, and give them a fair trial. If his tenure of office is uncertain, the probability is that lie will not trouble himself about doing anything, but will keep his eye on Members of Parliament and Ministers of State, and on persons of social influence, and endeavour to get into the good graces &gt;of newspaper proprietors. But with security of tenure he will, if he is a worthy man, direct his attention to the business of his office. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators have forgotten the fact that every civil servant appointed during good behaviour is practically independent of the Government. So long as he carries out his duties in a proper manner no Minister will dare to attack him, or if he does will do so at his peril. Suppose an un worthy man is appointed. Will he not be likely, towards the end of his term, to intrigue with the Government and Members of Parliament for their support for the renewal of his term, and will not that be ten times worse than appointing him during good behaviour ? Why should we attach so much more importance to the commissioner than to other members of the public service? There are public servants in Victoria who have held office during good behaviour during the last twenty years, - and no Government would dare to attack .them unless they committed some breach of discipline, or were guilty of some fault in the discharge of the duties of their office. I shall support the proposal for the appointment of the commissioner during good behaviour with no fixed tenure. </para>

                        <para>- It might be five or ten, but there should be some considerable time. I quite agree that no office ca.n be established under the Government which will not be subject to some political control. Whether the commissioner is appointed for seven or fourteen years, he will be liable to be influenced by political considerations. But what we have to do is to make the risk of political influence as small as possible. Nearly all officers whose tenure of office is considerable in time are so placed that the)7 may not be subjected to undue pressure from political sources. We want to give the commissioner such a tenure that a Minister of the Crown can reasonably and properly shelter himself behind that tenure, and say, when influence is brought to bear upon him - " This is not a matter with which I can interfere, because Parliament has deliberately and thoughtfully placed it under the control of an officer occupying an important permanent position." I can quite understand that, for whatever time the officer is appointed, there will be a considerable disposition on his part towards the end of his tenure to use political influence in order that he may retain his office. But if he is appointed for a fixed term, when his time expires there is, as a matter of course, an end to the appointment, and there can be no complaint if he is not re-appointed. The fair medium between appointment during will and appointment during good behaviour is an appointment for a term of years, and seven years is reasonable. </para>

                    <para>- In my opinion there is a clear and material difference between the office of such an individual as a judge, and that of the commissioner contemplated by this Bill. In the first place, in selecting a gentleman to occupy a judicial position, we have regard primarily to his possession of certain knowledge. We do not take into consideration to any great extent the individuality of the man himself. The duty that devolves upon him he discharges by reason of the fact that he is acquainted with certain principles governing certain sets of facts  that are brought before him. Whatever may be the divergent qualities of certain individuals, they may be equally capable of discharging duties such as these, but in the case of the commissioner who is to be invested with the powers proposed by this Bill, we must have regard to a number of circumstances that do not come into consideration in the appointment of an officer to exercise judicial functions. The commissioner will have not merely judicial, but administrative work to perform. He will have to show initiative. He will have to exercise discretion, and to deal with facts and circumstances, not necessarily by any uniform set of principles that he could apply to each individual case. He will have duties to discharge that will necessitate his taking into consideration in many wises the differences between the very persons to whom he would apply the principles governing him in the administration of his department. The position of the commissioner will be totally different from that of a Judge. We could select six or seven individuals equally competent to discharge judicial functions, and yet not one of them might have the slightest initiative. Not one of them possibly could, in certain circumstances, be trusted to exercise his discretion to advantage. We must have as commissioner a man with a judicial mind, who has the courage of his convictions, and who possesses initiative as well as organizing ability. When we select an individual to occupy a judicial office, we make certain that his legal knowledge is of such a character, and of such an extent, that he is qualified to discharge the duties which devolve upon him, and which do not involve the exercise of too much personal discretion. We can safely appoint such a man for life, or during good behaviour, but if we appoint a commissioner for life, or during good behaviour, and find subsequently that he has not the faculty for organizing sufficiently developed ; that he has not sufficient initiative ; that he is content to remain in the old rut; and that there are other individuals readily obtainable, better qualified to fill the office, we shall not be in a position to retire him and to make a new appointment. The commissioner might behave well, but he might be absolutely incapable -of discharging the duties of the office to the best advantage of the service. </para>

                        <para>- Yes that is the difference. If it is recognised that there is a material distinction between the two officers, then we cannot argue by analogy that we should appoint a commissioner during good behaviour. If we appointed a commissioner during good behaviour, we might have an officer who discharged his duties in a perfunctory manner, but who was not guilty of misbehaviour, and we should not be able to supersede him. We have agreed to the appointment of a commissioner. The question has been discussed at great length, and now we have come to the question of tenure. I think it is advisable that the term of office should be fixed. Whether it is 5, 7, or 10 years is, to me, a matter of comparative detail, but I think we ought to agree to appoint the commissioner for a. definite term, in order that he may be nerved up to a proper discharge of his duties to the best of his ability. If he desired to have his term renewed, he would do his duty during the seven years. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter of comparative detail. If we gave him a fixed term of office it would be some inducement to him to do his best. " He would discharge his duties to the best of his ability in order to obtain a renewal of his appointment. It would be unwise to provide for his appointment for life, because a man might be selected for the position who was not fit for it. Further than that, if the commissioner were appointed for life, he would have not the slightest inducement to exercise his ability in the best interests of the service. </para>

                        <para>- I see that there are objections to the suggestion, but the Ministry should try to get over them. They should not make brand-new appointments outside, when there are State officers capable of doing the work, and whose services could be spared. Honorable senators complain that unless the commissioner is given a certain tenure, a man is not likely to leave any position to take the office. Can they deny for a moment that there must be half-a-dozen men in the State services who are capable of acting as commissioner? Any one of these men could be used as commissioner, and if Parliament should do away with the office, he could return to the State service. That would give the States an opportunity of making retrenchment for which they are all crying out.. I assume that if the position were offered to an outsider in a bank, he would want to know the terms of his appointment. He would say - " If you give me a seven years' appointment at £1,500 a year, I will take the position." But if the Government select a man from a State service, they can tell him that if the commissionership is done away with after he has served a year or two, he can go back to the State service. </para>

                <para>It must be admitted that we should be doing wrong and passing a mischievous law if we allowed the appointment of these six inspectors, or any number of them, to be made in the same manner, and placed them on the same plane, as the commissioner. Words fail me to describe the very high officer that this commissioner is to be. In fact, I fear that the inspectors will be hardly fit to black his boots. But at any rate, the inspectors would be the right hand of the commissioner. They have no power of initiative whatever. They have nothing to do but report. If honorable senators compare their duties with those of the commissioner, they will grant that the Government have made an error in putting them on the same plane as the commissioner. In another place, the Minister for Home Affairs said that three inspectors would be the outside number that would be appointed at first. I believe we shall find that none will be required. The chief officers of the departments will organize and inspect day after day and hour after hour, and these galloping inspectors are not wanted. </para>

                        <para>- In the first place, the Bill does not propose to put the inspectors on the same level as the commissioner. The last time this clause was under discussion I had to resist an inclination on the part of honorable senators to put the inspectors on the same level as the commissioner. We were then discussing the question of whether the commissioner should have the power to suspend an inspector, or to determine what his duties should be from time to time. The position I then took up was that it was not desirable that the inspectors should be placed upon the same level as the commissioner, and they are not under this Bill. </para>

                    <para>- I hope we shall dispose of this matter very quickly. I do not think that there is a feeling anywhere that these inspectors should, as regards tenure, be in exactly the same position as the commissioner. It is useless to discuss now the question of their position as compared with that of the commissioner in respect of other matters. It seems to me that the inspectors should not be appointed for a term of seven years, and I hope the amendment will be carried. </para>

                        <para>- Several honorable senators desired that the power of suspension in the case of an inspector should be taken away from the commissioner. I pointed out that the effect of that would be to put the inspectors more nearly on a level with the commissioner. I do not know whether it is desired that the inspectors should be reduced to a lower position than is intended under the Bill. They probably will be the representatives of the commissioner in the various States, and it is desirable that they should have some position which will prevent them from being merely the agents of the commissioner, and which will secure to them a certain amount of independence, in order that they may express their opinions fully and freely after having made an inspection of offices in the various States. </para>

Unless we take some stand, the Ministry can go outside the civil service and appoint these highly paid officers, and as sure as we are here now, we shall have to compensate some of them to get rid of them. The Minister tells us himself that this legislation is experimental. We know that it is, and when we know also that the States are going back on this legislation, why should we tie ourselves by these appointments. At the salaries proposed we can find numbers of capable men in the service, who will be only too glad to undertake what I believe to be impossible duties, because they will not have the knowledge which will enable them to carry out their duties, and it will be impossible to pump that knowledge into them. </para>

If we took them over as ordinary members of the civil service, we should have to turn them adrift without making any provision for them, when we found that their services were required no longer. To talk of putting them back into the service does not commend itself to my judgment. I think there should be a certain term fixed, in order to enable us to obtain the services of good men. At the end of the term we should be able to reconsider the position, without doing any injustice whatever to the officers. Whether the period of service should be seven years or less is a matter for argument. The Government consider that seven years is a fair term to fix. It would enable them to get the best men, and they would be in a position to reconsider the whole matter at the expiration of that period. </para>

                        <para>- No ; I did not say that. If the honorable senator will allow me, I will explain. In Queensland there are three members of the Public Service Board. Their term of office has come to an end, and I believe it is not proposed to continue the board owing to the fact that the greater number of public servants have been transferred from that State to the Commonwealth. The Postal department, which is the largest of all, as well as the Customs and Defence departments, have been taken over by us. The officers of the Railway department have never been under the Public Service Board, and therefore the only, departments in Queensland remaining to be dealt with by the Public Service Board are the Education department, the department of Home Affairs, the Treasury, the Attorney-General's department, and the Mines and Lands departments. The professional division of the Education department is not under the board, which exercises control only over the clerical division. The other departments which I have named, although important in. some respects, do not employ large staffs of officers. The greater number of civil servants are employed in the Postal and Education departments. The latest information which I have received from Queensland is that two members of the Public Service Board retire on pensions, while the remaining member will be appointed a police magistrate in Queensland. </para>

                        <para>- The vacancies would be filled on the understanding that the inspectors would return as soon as they had completed the work of organizing the Commonwealth departments. Surely we do not require to keep eight or ten men constantly employed in organizing the Commonwealth departments, and determining the position to be filled by John Jones and Bill Smith? Surely we can leave something to the heads of the departments ? We have a Secretary to the Postmaster-General and a Deputy Postmaster-General in each State, and they and the officers under them should be able to determine upon the men eligible for promotion. It should be unnecessary to keep a great staff employed in carrying out that work. If we do, then before the Commonwealth has been in existence very long the whole service will be disorganized. Even if we appoint a commissioner 'there is no reason why the men who assist him should not be taken from the respective State services, at the salaries received by them at the time of transfer, and on the understanding that they will be returned to their old positions when their services are -no longer required by the Commonwealth. In that way we should be able to economize. We are continually talking about economy, but at the same time we are going in for extraordinary expenditure. I fail to see how we are to meet it. We shall make the Commonwealth unpopular by this enormous expenditure. I should like to see the word " inspectors " struck out of the clause. 'Let the commissioner select from the civil service of the several States the men best fitted to assist him. </para>

                        <para>- There are a number of ways in which savings might be effected. While the inspectors were engaged in the work of organizing the Commonwealth departments, the duties formerly discharged by them in the State departments could be carried out by officers appointed temporarily in their stead. Thus fresh appointments would be necessary only at the bottom of the ladder. I see no reason why we should not strike out the word " inspectors," and organize our departments in a way less expensive than that proposed in the Bill. </para>

They should be placed on the same footing as other civil servants, and appointed in the same way. We should be able to return them to their old positions if they prove unsuitable for the work. Surely in the huge departments of the Commonwealth room could be found for an ordinary civil servant receiving even £800 a year? </para>

                        <para>- If we ask a public officer to leave an assured position in order to accept an office where his services may be required for only a limited time, we must offer him a fixed tenure. It is very desirable to appoint really good men, because the inspectors will represent the commissioner in the various States. I believe that the Minister for Home Affairs did say that probably, at the start, it would not be necessary to appoint more than three inspectors. But, still, whether three or more are appointed, they will represent the commissioner in the States. The commissioner must of necessity be located at the seat of Government for the greater part of his time. The inspectors will be the eyes and ears of the commissioner ; they will go through the States and see the work which the officers are doing, and report to him. If it is desirable to have a good strong man in the position of commissioner it is equally desirable to have good strong men as his representatives in the States. </para>

                    <para>- These Bills are not necessarily copied from one another, and it does not necessarily follow that because a word appears in another measure it should therefore be in this. Unless some reason is given for the insertion of the word in this sub-clause, it would be better to leave it out. </para>

                    <para>- It occurs to me that the Audit Act is wrong, and this sub-clause right. If a person is ill, some one can be obtained to take his place. The word illness covers both mental and physical illness. If a person is absent, some one can take his place. His place can also be taken if he is suspended. But " incapacity " must refer to incompetency ; and if a person is incompetent he should be suspended. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to test the opinion of the committee with regard to the salary of the commissioner, I do not expect that he will be a paragon of every virtue, but assuming that he is a thoroughly capable man, there is no reason for paying him more than the Judges and Agents-General are paid by some of the States. In Tasmania we pay our two puisne Judges £1,200 a year, and our Agent-General £1,250 a year. In South Australia, they paid the Agent-General £1,500 formerly, and now they call him a general-agent, and have reduced the salary to £1,200. </para>

We have to do the fair thing. We want a man who is accustomed to the civil service, who can organize, and is capable of deciding who is the proper person to take the place of any officer who drops out.

                        <para>- In my humble opinion, the position of' the Public Service Commissioner is more important than that of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General  will not have the power of making large savings and great economies in the same way as this Public Service Commissioner. The Auditor-General does not require to have the varied intellectual powers which should be possessed by this commissioner, if the proper man is appointed. I admit, of course, that the office of Auditor-General is an honorable one, but it is largely technical ; and the Public Service Commissioner must be a first-class all round man, or else he will be a failure. I hope the Government will not appoint a man who is likely to turn, out a failure. If, as I hope,, the Public Service Commissioner will be an officer promoted from one of the existing departments, he will naturally hesitate before he will accept such an. appointment at what may be only a slight increase upon the salary he is at present receiving, because this is an appointment for seven years, and at the end of that term the officer may be compelled to retire. Unless we give some inducement in the shape of a reasonable salary I do not see how we can expect to get a thoroughly capable man. I grant that we might get as good a man for £1,000 as we would get for £.1,500, but that is a matter of chance. The position is a very important one, and the officer holding it should, I think, receive £1,500 a year. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and that because the Government could obtain a good man at that salary, it was unnecessary to pay more. If a capable man can be secured for the office of Auditor-General at £1,000 per annum, we should be able to obtain a competent commissioner at the same salary. We have a perfect right to say that a good man can be obtained for this office at the salary I have named, in view of the fact that the Postmaster-General has told us that a capable officer can be secured for appointment as Auditor-General at a salary of £1,000 per annum. To make any comparison between the duties and responsibilities of the Public Service Commissioner, and those of the Comptroller of Customs, requires a tremendous stretch of the imagination. The one has simply to see that men are promoted according to seniority and ability, while the other has to deal with a thousand and one most intricate and difficult; matters relating to the Customs. Far more ability is requisite to supervise the work of the Customs department than to perform the duties of the Civil Service Commissioner, That officer will have the assistance of all the heads of departments. Practically he will be able to do nothing without their advice. How would it be possible for him to know whether John Jones, in a branch of ' the service in Western Australia, was more eligible for promotion than Bill Smith. He must depend entirely upon the reports which he receives from his officers, and deal with those reports according to certain principles. The Comptroller of Customs, however, has to decide far more difficult matters. He has to determine what goods are subject to composite duties, what are liable to fixed duties, and many other difficult questions. </para>

                        <para>- If he is a good man, and the office is retained, no doubt he will have a better chance of getting the appointment than will any other man, but this is one of the chances he has to take. While the position of Auditor-General is one of very great responsibility, requiring very great skill and ability, it is not so onerous as that of the Public Service Commissioner. It does not require the days and nights of work which will necessarily be required from the man who will undertake the organization of the public service of the Commonwealth. There is a great deal to do in the way of classification, That has been done to a certain extent in each State, but we have to harmonize the services of the six States, and produce uniformity in the grading and the salaries. Those who think that that is a work which any one can perform cannot have had sufficient personal experience to enable them to form an opinion. We are told that the permanent heads of the departments have this knowledge. No doubt a permanent head has a considerable amount of knowledge in regard to his own department, but if the transferred services are to be harmonized, we must have one head with strong, well-defined powers, and great organising ability, who will be assisted by the knowledge which is possessed by the heads of the transferred departments. Can we expect to get a man of that character if we cut down the salary to £1,000 or even to £1,200 a year ? We shall not get a man who is commanding a salary of £1,000 a year to accept the position. I do not think we could find a man with the requisite ability in the lower ranks of the State services. </para>

                        <para>- If we take all the States I think it will be found that a great number of public officers are getting more than £1000 a year. The head of the Postal department, the head of the Customs department, and the Auditor-General occupy positions which must go on from year to year, so that it is necessary to offer a salary which will tempt a first-class man to give up a position which is not likely to be abolished, and accept the uncertain office of Public Service Commissioner. </para>

                    <para>- The difficulty I see about it is that the salary of the ordinary civil servant is placed upon the Estimates every year without question, and he is not liable to be reduced. I do not see why we should make a special case of these inspectors. If we accept the amendment we shall invite Parliament every year to reduce or increase the salaries. I do not think- that in justice to these civil servants they should be placed in that anxious position. They would be more likely to do their duty honestly and fairly if their salaries were fixed at a reasonable rate. I think it would be better even to fix the salaries at a lower rate than is here proposed than that they should remain to be voted year by year. </para>

                        <para>- There will no doubt be plenty of opportunities if it is the wish of the Senate, to provide for their appointment for some term less than seven years. The several honorable senators expressly stated that the appointment should be for a less term than seven years. If the inspectors are to be appointed for a fixed term, there is no reason why they should not have their salaries fixed in the same way as the commissioner. </para>

                    <para>- We clearly understood when we made the amendment in sub-clause (2) that its effect would be to put the inspectors in the matter of their appointment in the same position as other civil servants, and that their salaries would appear on the Estimates annually. The Postmaster-General appears to have indicated that at the earliest opportunity, when the Government think they have a majority, they will move the recommittal of the clause .and endeavour to get the words which the committee has decided to omit, re-inserted. This only shows that we shall be right in striking out these words. We must now insist that the salaries of the inspectors shall not be appropriated by a special Act, but shall appear on the Estimates year by year, and be voted in the same way as the salaries of ordinary civil servants. After the suggestion thrown out by the Postmaster-General, we shall be doing less than our duty if we do not insist upon the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- That is the very point I am coining to. This re-grading can only be done by the man who knows one particular State acting in conjunction with other men, whether they be chief officers, permanent officers, or inspectors. They must act loyally and honorably, and they will have to take one another's word. When they see a man named " A " in one State with the same length of service as " B " in another State, they will have to take one another's word as to which of the two is better qualified. There must be a great deal of guesswork. The idea in proposing that there should be six inspectors is that there should be one inspector for each State. While I desire to secure on behalf of Tasmania a fair share of the plums and good billets, I cannot help saying that we do not want an inspector. We have not got sufficient work for him. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly it has. The Postmaster-General admits that the inspectors must make inquiries from the chief officers, but why should we pay men high salaries for making inquiries from the very officers who know exactly what is to be done? The proposal is monstrous. Are these inspectors to be auditors, just as bank inspectors are ? No. Are they going to be responsible for the discipline of the department ? No. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned senator seems to know more than the Bill says in regard to that point. I do not know whether it is intuition or merely his own idea of how the Bill should be administered. If there is to be a proper system of classification thereinust be a report as to the systems which are carried on in the different States, and one system will have to be instituted for the whole Commonwealth. If an inspector is nob made independent, how will it be possible for him to furnish a report condemning the system in force in any -State. If he is made subordinate to the chief officer, it will be very difficult for him to do so. He will be employed like any other civil servant, and undoubtedly he will raise a storm of dissent if he condemns a system which has been working in one State for perhaps 40 or 50 years. </para>

                        <para>- I think I am speaking for a number of honorable senators, including my honorable friend. Some honorable senators appear to prefer the system in force in their respective States. They do not see that when we have conflicting and varying systems in all the States a change is required. For instance, if a man established a. bank in Melbourne he would not require to appoint inspectors, but if he found it necessary to open branches in the capital of each State he would need their services. "When this alteration is made, it will be necessary to have inspectors. One honorable senator has made some very weighty and statesmanlike arguments relative to the national debt of Australia, as bearing upon the point whether inspectors should be paid £800 per annum or less. </para>

                        <para>- We are not discussing the question of salary at this moment, and the honorable senator will get every assistance from me in cutting down expenditure at all points. If we appropriate the salaries of the inspectors in this Bill the amounts will appear in a schedule on the annual estimates and cannot be interfered with. It is very desirable that their actions should not be liable to annual discussion in Parliament. The idea is to place them in such a position of independence of outside influence that if they are honest and patriotic, they will do the best they can for the community. </para>

                        <para>- Then Victoria is the only spot on the face of the globe where it has not happened. I know that Members of Parliament are continually urged by constituents to secure billets for this man or for that man. Instead of being anxious to revert to the old system of Ministerial control and political patronage, honorable senators should be glad to institute the new system. I am going to support the Government in their effort to clear out political influence, and parlour influence. Honorable senators have placed the commissioner in a position of complete independence, but they propose to emasculate the scheme of non-political control by reducing the inspectors to subordinate positions. The inspectors should be able to move amongst the officers of the departments subject to no control by the heads, and free to criticise them, too. </para>

                        <para>- No; we are trying to limit unnecessary expenditure as much as possible. We contend that this Bill will entail an expenditure altogether inadequate to the services that the Commonwealth will receive, and that being so, we are of opinion that at least the salaries of the inspectors should be voted annually. </para>

                    <para>- Is not the honorable senator asking the committee to stultify itself? In the first part of the clause we have already decided that there shall not be more than six inspectors - not " may " be, but " shall " be. Now, we are asked in this sub-clause to provide that the salaries of these inspectors shall be provided by special appropriation. If instead of a special appropriation the salaries are voted annually, it will simply mean that Parliament may undo what we have already decided shall be done. My own feeling has been from the first that the inspectors should be on all fours with the chief commissioner, so far as appointment and tenure are concerned, and' certainly there should be a special appropriation for their salaries. </para>

                    <para>- Ministers appear to me to be placing themselves in an extraordinary position. Assuming that they had decided that the commissioner had done something which justified his suspension, the clause provides that if after he is suspended Parliament does not pass a resolution confirming his suspension, he must go back to his position. What would then be the position of Ministers with regard to that commissioner ? He could -simply snap his fingers at them. The effect of this sub-clause will be to destroy all Ministerial control. We have what we call responsible Ministers, we are paying them high salaries, and they hand over their duties to a commissioner who is a buffer between them and Parliament. Now we find that if they think it necessary to suspend the commissioner, and Parliament does not take the matter up, he can snap his fingers at Ministers and go back to his place. I contend that under this subclause Ministers are lowering their own position, and making themselves subordinate to an officer whom they should control. </para>

                    <para>- I would point out to Senators Dobson and Charleston that if Ministers suspend a commissioner, their first care will be to put themselves right, and to justify their action. They will take very good care that Parliament does pass the necessary resolution. I think, therefore, that the honorable senators to whom I refer are needlessly apprehensive as to what will happen. </para>

                    <para>- I am not sure that the wording of the Audit Act is an improvement upon this. In the one case, the Audit Act provides that an officer must not engage in any employment outside the duties of his office. This clause says - " Any paid employment." There is a sub1stantial difference. I do not know that an inspector should be debarred from engaging in honorary employment. I should not like to make an amendment unless I was assured that it was an improvement. </para>

                        <para>- Of course this is a very stringent clause. It does not involve the infliction of punishment upon an officer or the suspension of him for absence without leave. The paragraph contemplates that the officer may have gone away without an explanation. In that case he is deemed to have vacated his office without having had an opportunity of defending himself. So far from reducing the term, it almost seems to me that we should make it longer. It really means that if he is away from his office for fourteen days it will be equivalent to his having sent in his resignation. </para>

                        <para>.- I think the fourteen days period is little enough, because the iniquities of inspectors are provided for elsewhere, and this is merely a question of forfeiting the office if by some ill-chance the inspector does not obtain leave. An inspector may be in parts where it is impossible to obtain leave. </para>
