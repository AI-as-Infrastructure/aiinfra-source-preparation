                        <para>- I wish to ask the Post- master-General, without notice, whether he will invite the Government to hold over the consideration of the Sugar Duties until the Pacific Island Labourers Bill has been dealt with. I. notice that this question was raised in another place, but that it only elicited an expression from the Minister for Trade ' and Customs, that he thought the matter ought to be postponed. </para>

                        <para>He held that the sugar industry could not do without kanaka labour - at least, he said subsequently that the growers raised this contention. However, he would not for a moment advocate it if it could be shown it could be done without. But he was prepared to leave the question to the Federal Parliament for decision ; our own Parliament, he thought, was too prejudiced. It was very necessary, in the interests of the planter, that the matter should be settled, and not left to changing of Governments. </para>

                        <para>The Bill places under the control of the Federal Parliament certain matters eagerly sought by labour, which are not so likely to be favorably dealt with by the State Parliaments, with their less democratic Constitutions, and which will certainly not for many years be granted throughout Australia, apart from federation. These are such as naturalization and aliens, invalid and old-age pensions, conciliation and arbitration. </para>

                        <para>The truth is that to-morrow offers to the democracy of labour an opportunity of advancement and security unique in the history of notions. To-morrow, for the Queensland democrat, the tide is at the flood, and such a flood as the world never saw outside of Australia. Let him miss the opportunity, and for him and Queensland the flood ebbs under the reaction, not to come round again, perhaps, for a generation, and never to come again with such freshness and fulness pf promise as it is coming now. Take it at the flood, and it will lead, to fortune as surely as it leads to great and honorable nationhood. </para>

I have not got the money to go into this industry. There are very few men who have examined this question more carefully than I have done. I have travelled through the sugar-growing districts, and so far as my means and my intellect have permitted, I have looked into the question thoroughly. I know of no part of Queensland, or of any branch of industry there, in which white men cannot do the work, provided they are paid properly and work under fair conditions. ' We have long heard the same old wail, that if the kanaka is abolished the sugar industry will be ruined, and the interests of 20,000 white men. directly and indirectly engaged in the industry seriously affected. Are these 20,000 white men who labour in connexion with the industry or in the sugar fields ?- </para>

                        <para>It was, however, answered that tropical agriculture could not be performed by white men, and that the employment of coloured labour was therefore inevitable. This statement I always doubted, and careful inquiries made from time to time led me to reject it altogether. </para>
                        <para>My objections to Polynesian labour were, however, from the first less strong than to the introduction of Asiatics. The people of the Pacific islands are not so numerous as to be a permanent danger to our social or political institutions, and I have always regarded their employment as a temporary and transitional expedient. It was not, therefore, until 1885 that I was induced, under circumstances to which I need not now refer, to propose to put a limit upon the time within which they might be introduced. And this proposal, which was accepted by the Legislative Assembly without division, though ' not without dissent, was, I believe, supported as much on the ground of the scandals which had attended the labour trade as for any other reason. </para>
                        <para>Let me now invite your attention to what has happened since that time. I will state results only. But I promise that these results are, in my opinion due, in great part, to the legislation to which I have just referred, as well as a general conviction on the part of the planters, as well as the people generally, that a radical change was necessary in the system of sugar culture. </para>
                        <para>In the first place, the system of large estates worked- by gang labour has fallen into disfavour. The owners are not only willing but anxious to sell or lease portions of their estates to farmers who will themselves grow the cane and sell it to the manufacturers. And it is recognised, I think generally, that .in future the cultivation of the cane and the manufacture of sugar must be in different hands. </para>
                        <para>In the second place, it has been established by actual trial that sugar is a profitable crop to be grown by small farmers if they can command a sale for it to the manufacturers at reasonable prices. And this system is already carried on with great success, notably in the Bundaberg, Mackay, and Herbert River districts. </para>
                        <para>In the third place, it has been proved that in Queensland cane can be grown by white labour. I am aware that this position is still disputed, but it is admitted by most of the more liberal minded planters with whom I have been in communication. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>I remember very well that, when the question was first raised, it was alleged emphatically and without qualification that it was impossible for white persons to grow cane without the aid of coloured labour. Of course that contention was exploded years ago, and the fact is admitted on many sides, except by the most prejudiced persons who, I am sorry to say, are not a few, that white men can cultivate, trash, cut and handle the cane, manufacture it into sugar, and place the product in the market without the slightest aid from coloured sources. </para>

                        <para>These results have not, however, been attained without the troubles which invariably attend the trying of new experiments. Successive Governments have endeavoured to assist the enterprising experimenters by giving facilities for the introduction of European labour of various kinds, and by aid to central mills. But these endeavours have been counteracted from two different directions. While some of the planters have loyally tried to make the best of the altered conditions and prospects - and I am glad to know, in many instances, with conspicuous success - others for a long time set their faces against any change, and did all in their power to compel a return to the old objectionable state of things. </para>

                        <para>In the meantime the planters as well as the smaller farmers already engaged in sugar culture do not know where to turn for the necessary labour to cultivate and take off their crops, while the many others, who are anxious to engage in the industry on the new conditions, are deterred from doing so for the same reasons. The immediate prospect is that many of the mills will be closed, and some removed, and the productiveness of the lands of the colony, instead of being largely increased, will be seriously diminished. </para>
                        <para>We are then in this position : - On the one hand, it is proved that the sugar industry offers u field for the settlement of numberless families upon the land, where they can live and bring up their families in comfort. The danger of the aggregation of large estates is past ; and it is shown that Europeans can engage in the industry with success when certain preliminary work has been done. </para>

                        <para>If, then, the system, now happily inaugurated, of small farmers, is to be carried on to a final success, I can see no alternative but to permit for a time, at any rate, the resumption of Polynesian immigration. Adequate provision must of course be made, and they can be made, for preventing abuses in the introduction of the labourers, and for preventing them from entering into competition with white labourers in other occupations, and it should be provided that the immigration shall continue (unless, of course, otherwise determined by the Legislature) for a definite but limited period, of, say, ten years. By that time I have no doubt that such further developments will have taken place as will enable the sugar industry to be carried on without fear of our reverting to the former system, with its dangerous incidents and consequences, and in the meantime I believe that a valuable impetus will be given to the producing industries of the colony. </para>

                    <para>First of all comes the coloured labour question, on which, indeed, depends our very existence as a free people. Every year that passes deepens my conviction that a free, self-governing population and a servile population, not admitted to a share in the Government, cannot possibly exist together in the same country. You will, no doubt, be told that the question is settled. I wish I could believe that it is settled, but I cannot forget that it is only a few months since the champions of coloured labour, in the prospect of the coming general election, discontinued for a time their unmeasured abuse of the Government for their action in this respect. I am unable to believe in the genuineness of their conversion, and think it more likely that if the opportunity offered they would act upon the principle which they have always consistently followed, and let the future take care of itself, if only for the present they can make money for themselves and their absentee allies. Is this apprehension not supported by the fact that only a few days ago we were informed that a recent distinguished visitor has been proclaiming in England, as a settled and admitted fact, that the north of Australia . must in future belong to the coloured races ? I believe, on the contrary, that all Australia will be needed by the white races. And I am convinced that the agricultural lands in the tropical parts of the colony can be successfully and profitably cultivated by European settlers, working with their own hands, but as their own masters. </para>

I am gentlemen, your obedient servant, </para>

                        <para>With regard to this particular motion, I do not see that the Government are called upon to express any opinion whatever. But they will do so all the same. I will say at once what the intentions of the Government are. The Government do not for one moment intend to meet the difficulty in the way in which it was, attempted to be solved by the leader of the Opposition some years ago. That is to say, they do not intend to meet the wants, or the supposed wants, as some honorable members ' might call it, of the sugar planters by introducing cheap European labour. Nor do they propose to extend the existing provisions of the Polynesian Labourers Act. Those are two distinct propositions taken up by the Government. But the Government are prepared in any way they can, to meet, the sugar planters, by way of assisting them as regards irrigation, or in any other way by which such a great industry can be protected and preserved, and not destroyed. </para>

I think all that should be precluded. We should tell the planters exactly what we mean. It is better for them, and better for us all to know exactly what we do mean. We have been told by the Government what they mean. </para>

                        <para>No Government dare re-open the black labour question, even in the attempt to save a doomed industry. The present Government are pledged to the hilt to have no' more to do with coloured labour, and political tergiversation of so black a kind as would be implied in the adoption of the recommendation Of a majority of the commission is not possible. Honour would not permit it ; an all but unanimous people would not suffer it. The Queensland sugar industry is not doomed to extinction ; the possibilities of science and invention ore endless ; and if only the planters were - manfully to face their losses as other speculators have had to do, instead of dolefully appealing for help to the State, they would in time surmount all difficulties, and see a fair good arising out of a past evil. </para>

                        <para>The people of the whole of Australia are pretty well satisfied that black labour is doomed, and must cease, and I say this much : that the people who have been interested in black labour up to the present time are prepared to accept that decision. They have sense enough to see that they cannot fight against the inevitable, and therefore they submit. I do not say they have changed their opinions, because those opinions are founded on many years' experience and very careful consideration ; but at the same time, they can see clearly and distinctly that the people of Australia are determined this shall be a white man's country, and they bow to the inevitable. Therefore, I think that honorable members should take this in all sincerity, and not bring this cry in, because I believe it is once and for all settled. </para>

If in two or three years time honorable members went to the country, they might, by reason of their influence, succeed in inducing the country to agree to that reversal of policy.

                        <para>It is a striking commentary on this line of argument which is going to bring back this previous prosperity when we state that the industry has not been deprived of coloured labour yet. There are more Polynesians in this district than ever there were. The plantations are full to overflowing, in anticipation of the stoppage of the traffic. Further, there are numbers of kanakas walking the main streets, fishing on the river side, or sitting in and about the kanaka shops, - having no employment. </para>

Or is it because they ask os. or 6s. a week, whereas the new chum boys can. be had for less ? </para>

                        <para>The argument against the employment of kanaka labour is based on the assumption that, if given sufficient wages, white men will be found willing to do all the necessary field work of the sugar industry. There is no direct evidence in proof of this in the whole history of the industry in Queensland. Neither the constraint of hardship,, nor the compelling force of binding agreements, has induced white men for more than a short period to engage in the work of cane trashing or cane-cutting. In some cases the increased remuneration has been the very means of causing the worker to give up the hateful task all the sooner. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, it is. There is one little matter that. I did not make quite clear in the earlier portion of my remarks as to the statement made by Planter Swan at Cairns, with reference to the payment of a bonus on sugar. Of course, honorable senators are aware - and probably Planter Swan is also cognizant of the fact - that the bonus will be paid only on sugar grown by white labour, and not upon all sugar, whether produced by black or white labour. Prom interjections made by some honorable senators on the other side, I fancy they imagined I was urging that Planter Swan expected that this bonus would be paid irrespective of whether the sugar was produced by black or white labour. </para>

Owing to un unfortunate season, there being practically no rain when most needed, the sugar return has been very poor indeed, and crashing operations closed down very early. The adverse season experienced has been well met by the bulk of the tenant farmers, and very few have had to discontinue operations. The bureau has been instrumental in placing 407 applicants out of 70S, being, as compared with 1899, a decrease of 243 and 445 respectively. </para>

                            <para>- This is for the crushing season. We are being told continually that white men cannot do the work of cutting, and yet the report shows that after the mills had been supplied about 60 white men were still left. It is idle to talk about this being in the winter. According to some honorable senators it is never winter at Mackay. They have summer there all the year round, some honorable senators would have us believe. I will now deal with the Geraldton district, which is in the far north, where they have the heaviest rainfall and the greatest heat. The local agent there states - </para>

In May, June, and July the usual influx for the harvesting took place, but owing to the mills making a late start on account of bad crop, very many of the men became hard up, and represented themselves as destitute to the authorities. Some of these men were arrant frauds. Others were really decent men and were destitute. Any of the men who wanted it were found short jobs at small wages, in some instances and others gave two days' work for ninedays' food. About 120 men passed through the bureau in this manner. Applications from employers were 98, applications from labourers were 187, or an excess of 89 labourers. The 89 were all found short jobs, or "tucker" to enable them to get further along. </para>

                            <para>- It has been contended by some honorable senators that there ought to be an extension of time given to the planters, but before I deal with that I. wish to refer to another aspect of the question, and one which I think receives too little consideration. I refer to the moral question, of the mixture of the races. I am sure that most honorable senators are desirous of preventing the spread of that evil. It must be obvious that if we have, as we have in Queensland, nearly 24,000 coloured people, with the tremendous preponderance of males of about twenty to one over females, there must follow as a natural consequence some mixture of the races. Who are to find wives for these men ? I suppose that like ordinary human beings in other parts of the world, they will want wives. Who is going to find them? Are the daughters of the rich going to become the wives or the female companions of these men ? No ; if they want wives, as they will in very many instances, they will likely be expecting to get them from amongst the daughters of the poor and the industrial section of the community. I do not want either the daughters of the rich or the poor to be placed in this position. </para>

                        <para>In Queensland -we have two lazarettes wherein we place those social pariahs. The first lazarette was established at Friday Island, in Torres Straits, being proclaimed on the 27th October, 1892 ; the second, at Stradbroke Island, adjacent to Brisbane, on 25th November the same year. Since the establishment of these institutions, no less than 98 persons suffering from this nauseous disease have been segregated, the nationality of the patients being as follows : - Pacific Islanders, 41; Europeans, 2.1; Chinese, 20; Aboriginals, 9; Cingalese, 2; Malay 1; Philipino, 1 ; Mia dr a se se, 1. The number of patients who have died is 56, of the undermentioned nationalities - Pacific Islanders, 27; Europeans, 12; Chinese 9; Aboriginals, 3; Cingalese, 2; Malays, 1; Philipino, 1; Madrasese, 1. Ten of the lepers belonging to the Mongolian Empire were returned to China, while there are still remaining in the lazarette no less than 30 who are victims to this pestilential disease, eighteen being at Friday Island and twelve at Stradbroke Island. These inmates comprise the following: - Pacific Islanders, 14; Europeans, 9 ; Aboriginals, 6 ; Chinese, 1. When we consider the difficulty of detecting this foul disease, and the conditions of life among the kanaka population, it is safe to infer that hundreds of coloured lepers are roaming the sugar districts to the great danger of their countrymen and the white population. It is fortunate for the people of Queensland that this disease does not spread rapidly. Nevertheless, it is so insidious and mysterious that we may never know the moment it may be discovered in the mansion of the rich or the humpy of the poor. </para>

                            <para>- That may be. In the meantime we should deal with the matter as it stands ; the future will take care of itself. All those who take my view of this question - the Ministry and their supporters - are charged with ignorance. We are actually told by some of the clergy of the various churches that we know nothing of the subject, and' by some members of the Queensland Ministry that we have never worked in the cane-fields in our lives. What presumption it is to suggest that we should not legislate except we possess practical knowledge and working experience of the subject with which we are dealing ! Must we be engaged in the liquor trade before we can deal with the licensing laws of a State? Is there any honorable senator who has followed all occupations, and can we have no legislation on a subject unless we possess practical training and knowledge? The proposition is absolutely nonsensical. Some of the finest social legislation the world has seen has been effected by men who have had no practical experience. </para>

It is most important to Queensland. I know Queensland intimately. I travelled the length and breadth of the State 30 years ago. I drove from Rockhampton to near the Gulf, when I was very much younger. I have had investments in Queensland since 1867, continuously, largely, and unfortunately; for I never made any money out of Queensland, except when I bought a property and sold it. I never made money out of that State by the legitimate investment of capital, as my books will prove. When I was on the hustings previous to the election I said that I was in favour of a white Australia. </para>

                            <para>- On the hustings I said that I was in favour of a white Australia, and would support any Government to attain that object. I say that now. As to the supposed danger of an intermixture of races, I reply that there has never been any admixture so far as the kanaka is concerned. There was no intermixture on the part of the white population with the black population of Australia in the early days. The blacks of this country are nearly all dead now, with the exception of a few in Queensland. In the same way there has been no intermixture of the kanakas in Queensland with the white people of that State, Therefore, the position of the kanaka is not to be considered with the question of a white Australia. I desire once and for all to separate the two questions. The kanaka trade is under strict legislation, and to associate it with the question of a white Australia is to fail to do justice to the importance of the matter. </para>

                            <para>- It was paid under contract. This gentleman asserts that white men are not fit to do the work. We have before us statements made and resolutions passed on this question, by nearly all the municipal councils, agricultural societies, and chambers of commerce in Queensland. The Postmaster-General has been good enough to read many of these statements, although he is opposed to the view they represent. The Bishop of Carpentaria writes upon this subject in such a moderate way that it is impossible for any one to doubt his statements. </para>

                            <para>-It is something. If the kanakas in Queensland are not treated well, it is not the fault of the State Parliament. That Parliament has passed most restrictive legislation in regard to the trade; therefore, isolated cases of ill-treatment are beside the question. There are white men who are treated badly under our own laws, but we do not come here and announce, because of that, that the white people are going to the dogs. We must view all these matters as the world looks at them. Sometimes they are of good and bad report. I might mention in passing that there are 4,000 of these kanakas attending Sundayschools. </para>

                            <para>- I have not such a low opinion of the Bishop of Carpentaria as to believe that if he had a few shares it would affect his opinion. I may say that the tone of these interjections is not very high, and they only prove that in this Senate a very cursory and trumpery view of the whole question is being taken. The question is momentous. The abolition of kanaka labour will deprive thousands of farmers of the results' of hard industry under a sweltering sun, and we should not hurriedly pass a Bill that will have such an effect at the instance of any Government. I may tell honorable senators that I was returned as a supporter of the present Government in many respects, but I never dreamt that this Kanaka Bill would be brought in so early. What have the people of Queensland done that in the first session of the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, and within a few months of our meeting, such drastic legislation should be introduced, and they should be given only a couple of years to put their house in order? We know what may be the result when a Bill like this is put forward. Even wealthy men in every part of the world are very much beholden to banks. Big men as well as small men are beholden to them, and the more they are beholden to those institutions the more important it is to them that things should not be suddenly turned topsy-turvy. There are thousands of farmers who have gone into this industry at the instance and by the encouragement of the Queensland Government. Splendid mills have been erected in many districts of Queensland with a view to the breaking up of large sugar estates. The breaking up of those estates has come about, and there is no such unique position anywhere where sugar is grown as that which we find in Queensland at present, where there are so many small farmers engaged in the industry. Do I not delight in the establishment of small farmers anywhere ?I do not believe in cattle and sheep occupying country that can be more profitably occupied by farmers. In this case the Government of Queensland advanced large sums of money, built central mills, and encouraged the farmers in every possible way. </para>

                    <para>SenatorFRASER.- I shall refer to that a little later on. They have succeeded to a great extent. The small farmer can go to work at four o'clock in the morning, or on a moonlight night; he can choose his own time for working, and in a sweltering week perhaps he may not work at all. Working in this way, the small farmers can do much. </para>

Eight hundred miles is a tremendous distance. Just imagine it. It is more than four times as far as from here to Echuca, and it must be remembered that Cairns is that distance nearer the equator than Bundaberg. "I have been round the world three or four times, and I am sure there are places where one could" not live in the sweltering heat with a temperature of only 90 degrees. When I was building the railway line in South Australia, we had a temperature of 117 degrees in the shade at times. </para>

                        <para>I have arrived at the conclusion that it is the imperative duty of the Government, and perhaps more especially of myself, to whom rightly or wrongly much of the blame or credit of the existing state of things has been attributed, to review the present position and to state plainly what we think is the right policy to be adopted by the country at this time. The urgency of the case induces me to adopt the present somewhat unusual method of declaring that opinion. </para>

                            <para>- When I am buying goods, I do not very often ask where they have come from, and it is only by accident that sometimes I find out. At any rate I should like to help the native product if I can. The fact that the Queensland sugar industry has competed on equal terms with the world proves that it is a native industry able to hold its own against the world. It has been exporting to Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and elsewhere on even terms. Of course the duty on foreign importations will be of immense monetary advantage to the sugar-growers in New South Wales and the southern part of Queensland ; but the Constitution prohibits any differential treatment between one part of a State and another part. I spoke of this matter to some members of the Government, but, of course, I did not get a reply. I am perfectly convinced that if the Government had been able to apply a differential treatment to the sugar-growers in the. north of Queensland and those in the south and in New South Wales, they would have done so. But under the Constitution they had to make one condition for all. The sugar growers in the north, say near the equator, cannot possibly get on under the restrictions of this Bill. These men will be ruined, and disgrace will be brought upon the Parliament that passed the law. I have travelled Queensland since 1867. I hold interests in properties on the Flinders a long way north, and I know that on that coast it is impossible for a white man to live. </para>

                            <para>-I get them from the papers, and I make the statement with the full knowledge that my memory is not at fault. Will honorable senators risk the profitable employment of that vast army of men when they can allow matters to proceed for a few years, and time will unravel the problem ? I pray most fervently that the bonus system may be a success all over Queensland. As a man who has had some experience, I declare my honest conviction that it is not possible nor desirable for white men to be asked to work on the cane fields of Cairns. Will the. Senate run the risk of doing an incalculable injury to the first industry in that State ? </para>

                            <para>- In an agricultural sense the sugar industry is far and away the largest industry. The butter industry of Victoria was created by the grant of a bonus. If it were proposed to interfere with that industry there would be a howl. If it were proposed to interfere with any big industry of New South Wales or South Australia or Tasmania there would be a howl. The request of the planters is a reasonable one. Test the statements made by the Government. Do not be in a hurry to jump to conclusions which may prove to be wrong. Is it not right to satisfy me that my doubts are not well founded? When these representations come from the municipal councils of Queensland and all the various societies, when the Government and practically the Parliament of Queensland say the same thing, is it not fair to test the bonus principle before we pass this legislation ? This is not a white Australia business. I am with honorable senators for a white Australia. The kanaka does not interfere with the white Australia movement. Grant this modest request. It is a State right. The Senate has been created for the protection of State rights. When I was advocating the Constitution Bill on the hustings, I pointed out that the small States would not enter the Commonwealth unless they were allowed to return six or eight men to the Senate, and" I gave the reasons for my statement. One reason was that the Federal Parliament might propose to do the grossest injustice to a State, might introduce too drastic legislation, or might propose to spend £5,000,000 of money on the Federal House of Parliament. It is for senators to see that their States are not drastically, but justly, dealt with. I am not saying that the kanaka should not ultimately be excluded, but I am asking for time. </para>

                        <para>We saw plainly that there was one very prominent point in which we had failed in past legislation, and that we had by our legislation hurt an industry that might have been prosperous now. That was the sugar industry in the north. We saw that plainly. It was plain to any man who went north1. He had only to go to the towns to see the effect, not because there were starving black fellows there, but because he would find starving white men in all the towns, although he would see evident vestiges of the towns having been much larger in past years. That can be seen from Brisbane right up to Cooktown. Then, if he went into the interior a little, and visited the plantations; he would' find that what were formerly the scenes of industry now show a decaying industry, and an industry that is bound to go unless some means are adopted to keep it in existence. We had to face the position, and' we did face it, and we came to the- conclusion that the first thing to be done, the best remedy at the present time, was, under proper restrictions, to give them black labour again. </para>

I am pleading only -fora little justice ; for a few weeks delay. Surely that is reasonable. I entered the Senate as an honest supporter of the Government. I have always been independent of any Government, and always hope to be ; but I tell the Senate honestly that I did not expect this Government would propose to legislate upon this question so hurriedly. The people of Brisbane and Northern Queensland did not expect it. </para>

                            <para>- No. The statements made by municipal councils and other bodies show that they did not. I would give £1,000 to-morrow to have a plebiscite taken on this question in the State of Queensland, on the distinct understanding that the kanaka trade should be considered quite apart from the question of a white Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. I know what the feeling of Australia is in regard to a white Australia, and I approve of it, but the question of kanaka labour is a different matter. Even now I hope that some little deference will be paid to the opinions expressed by the Premier of Queensland. ' The Senate will probably bear with me while I read what the Premier of Queensland says in his petition - </para>

                        <para>It is under a grave sense of responsibility for the welfare of the State, whose interests I represent, that I take the unusual course of addressing you upon a question of legislation which is now engaging the attention of the Federal Parliament. The Pacific Island Labourers Bill having passed through all its stages in the Federal House of Representatives, has now been submitted to your Chamber, and though the appeal against the proposed legislation made by this Government, and supported by the sympathy of the great majority of members of the Queensland Parliament, by the whole of our agricultural and commercial associations, and by the principal press in the State, has failed to make any impression upon a majority of representatives committed to the abolition of the Pacific Island labour trade, I have reason to believe that there is a disposition on the port of a considerable number of the senators to give due consideration to so large a body of interested and expert opinion. It is under this impression that I take the liberty of addressing you, and in doing so it is not my purpose to present a full statement of the case for Queensland as against the proposed legislation. This has already been done in my letter on the subject to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, dated the 7th October ult. </para>
                        <para>The only considerations hitherto brought forward as selling  against t this claim for inquiry are, first, that the Federal Government are already in possession of sufficient information regarding the conditions of the sugar industry in Queensland to justify their introducing legislation in the direction proposed, and, second, that Queensland has already been heard in the matter, at the election of her representatives to the Commonwealth Parliament, the large majority of whom are pledged to the abolition of - Pacific Island labour. In reply to the first of these arguments, it is sufficient to state that the large and influential body of Queensland citizens who represent the best knowledge on the subject, and also the responsible Government of the State, who still claim to represent the majority of the people of Queensland, are not at all satisfied that the information p possessed by the Federal Government and Parliament is sufficient to enable them to take a correct view of the industrial conditions with which they are dealing, or of the probable results of the contemplated interference with these conditions, and they hold that this portion of the community, and the Government representing the whole community, have a claim to be satisfied that then State is not being legislated against, and, as they believe, penalized, through lack of such enlarged knowledge of the facts of the ease as would be acquired by means of the investigation asked for. It is surely worth considering whether it is well to refuse this satisfaction, even if the right to it is denied.- It is surely worth considering, as I have already represented to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, whether it ia wise at this early stage in the history of federation, to precipitate, without due inquiry, a policy which must necessarily alienate from the union a large number of those who were its most prominent advocates, especially when it is known that the concession of the desired commission, even if its findings , should prove adverse to Pacific Island labour, would be sufficient to do away with the present wide-spread and undisguised animosity which is felt here towards the Federal Government, and which, in the event of further inquiry being refused, is likely to outlive the generation that so recently welcomed the union with the most sanguine anticipations of the common benefit which was to result from the recognition by the combined States of the unity of their interests. </para>
                        <para>It should be clearly understood that such bitterness of feeling as prevails here does not spring from the mere fact that it is proposed to legislate against Pacific Island labour. Had this movement for the expulsion of "the kanaka" been the result of a sudden awakening of the public conscience to the sense of a moral wrong existing amongst us, the haste might have produced less exasperation even if the agitation were believed to be the result of a mistaken view of the case. </para>

                    <para>In this communication I have purposely confined myself to the question of the necessity for inquiry, as it is solely on that ground that our appeal to the Senate is made. The documents with which I am aware you have been supplied, together with the memorandum enclosed herewith, furnish you with the main facts of the case, but do not in any way supersede the necessity for special investigation. They do little more than show that a clear case for inquiry exists, and justify the demand that such inquiry be granted. They do not profess to have the authority which would attach to the report of a special commission, and it is the earnest desire of the Government of this State that information invested with such, authority should be in the hands of the Senate before they come to a decision on the present Pacific Island Labourers Bill. There rs no desire to dictate as to the constitution of the suggested commission, and I shall not venture further even in the way of suggestion than to state that I am satisfied that if a Royal commission consisting of two Supreme Court Judges and a gentleman with a practical knowledge of tropical agriculture were appointed for the purpose referred to, the people of this State, whatever might be the result of the investigation, would be unanimous in their recognition that the Federal Legislature are desirous to deal justly with the individual States even when interfering with their special industrial methods. I trust that the members of the Senate will perceive that it is a matter of vital importance to the stability of the Commonwealth that federal legislation be so conducted as to produce this impression upon the people of the individual' States, and that no more serious error in statesmanship could be committed, than such summary and arbitrary interference with a special industry as must necessarily sow dissension in the Commonwealth in the very first year of its existence. </para>
