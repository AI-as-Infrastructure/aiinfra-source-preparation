                        <para>- The question is whether it is desirable to do anything like that in this Bill, which practically is intended to deal with exactly the same class of persons as the Queensland Acts were designed to deal with. It is well not to have any conflict in our legislation, because, to a certain extent, the Queensland Acts for certain purposes remain in existence. We are starting on a new line, and surely the restraining of, men under other civilized powers from coming to Australia is a matter to be dealt, with in the Immigration Restriction Bill. I think that the general idea has been that what was wanting was to put a stop to the recruiting of this class, of labour from the islands which are under no civilized power, and have no Government to protect them. </para>

                        <para>- The fact that the jurisdiction of some of the Pacific islands has changed, and that the conditions are constantly changing, makes it desirable that we should have in this measure an expression wide enough to cover all the islands in the Pacific. The administration may be trusted not to overstep the powers conferred upon them by the Bill, but it is desirable that questions should not arise as to whether some of the islands where recruiting may take place are under the jurisdiction of a civilized power or not. As the jurisdiction of the islands is changing time after time, it is desirable that a wider definition should be used. </para>

                    <para>- If we are going to take in hand the definition of the words " Pacific Island Labourer," I should like to point out that the Postmaster-General has led us to understand that the definition contained in this Bill has been inserted with an express object. If it is a good object something may be said for it. When I interjected yesterday that the words " not in the jurisdiction of any other civilized power " were part of the definition, the Postmaster-General and other honorable senators appeared to have forgotten that fact. Is the definition in, the Bill, which differs from the definition in the Acts we are amending, being put in with any specific object, and is that object of sufficient importance to override the necessity which exists in most cases for observing uniformity of language when amending an Act 1 That is what I want to know. If we leave out the words " not in the jurisdiction of any other civilized power " we may have some of the islanders from Samoa or the Sandwich Islands, or some of the 350,000 natives in New Guinea coming into the Commonwealth, and they will not be hedged round with the restrictions which apply to Pacific Island labourers. If we leave out these words, all these later sections in the Pacific Island Labour Acts - which I understand the white men regard as of so much importance - will not apply to them. Therefore, unless there is some very good reason for altering the definition it appears to be most unstatesman-like that, when amending State Acts, we should depart from the definition contained in those Acts, when that definition is the sole subject matter thereof. </para>

When I am not helping the Government to do right,
                    am helping . them not to do wrong. If they will not take advantage of my hint and make the alteration which seems to me to be necessary, then, of course, the consequences must rest with them.

The Polynesian Labourers Act of 1880 refers to these islanders as " passengers," and contains this provision, which has not been altered in any subsequent Act - </para>

                    (New South Wales)- - The Postmaster-General has, no doubt, seen a great deal of the correspondence in connexion with this subject, which has appeared in the Brisbane press. I have seen from it that the Messrs. Young have persons on their Fairymead  plantation who have been married for fifteen or sixteen years, and who have reared families there. I take it that the children are British subjects, and are we going to deport the parents and leave the children here without them ? The Queensland Parliament is to blame for not definitely fixing the time at which the kanakas must return, instead of allowing them to go on renewing their agreements. ' 'I hope that we shall not be guilty of the savagery of sending these parents back to their islands, and leaving their children here as orphans. They are comparatively very few in number, and I do not see why they should not be allowed to remain. The percentage is about 21/2,or about five people in every 200. Are the other 195 afraid that the five are going to demoralize them? I must press the amendment to a division.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - The further I go into this matter the more difficult it becomes, and it is rendered all the more difficult by the fact that the statistics so far show that on the 31st March last there were 4,416 kanakas who had resided continuously in Queensland for over six years. While I think it is a black spot on its escutcheon that Queensland ever entered into this abominable traffic, still we have to act in a reasonable manner. I cannot conceive that it is intended to deport all those kanakas who have resided for the term of not one agreement, but two agreements, and who apparently have expressed an intention to remain. These men had ample opportunity, if they so desired, to return at the end of the first; agreement, and again at the end of the second agreement, but they did not do so. According to
                    they are the least objectionable of the dark-coloured races in Australia. In the Queensland Act, 47 Victoria, No. 12, it was recognised that those kanakas who had resided for five years an the colony and had an exemption should be allowed to remain. If that was fair then, I utterly fail to see how we can refuse a similar concession to those who have resided for an equal term since that time.
                    says that we may trust the officials to administer the Act honestly and humanely. I have had considerable experience in public life, and I do not know that I should be prepared in all cases to trust any officials with the administration of an important law of this sort.

                        <para>- Why do the majority of the kanakas remain ? It is the ambition of a kanaka when he returns to his island to take back a box filled with clothing and trumpery sold to him at a very high price by white or Chinese residents. Sometimes that box cannot be provided within the term, because their wages have been taken from them as penalties for some simple offence for which a white man would never be molested. They would rather remain in Queensland than return without their box. In the absence of a box many have had to remain who would have been deported long ago. For what purpose do honorable senators wish 4,000 odd kanakas to be kept here for ever ? To provide the planter with cheap labour and to deny fair wages and conditions to men of their own flesh and blood. If that is so, in the interests of Queensland, as well as in the interests of the islanders, it is better that they should go back and be treated humanely and educated to a certain extent by the good missionaries than that they should be allowed to remain for the purpose of making fortunes for men who have very little consideration for their welfare, physically or morally. </para>

Some honorable senators prate about humanity and Christianity, but when they are called upon to put their professions into practical form, they do nothing of the kind. There are honorable senators who look upon this business in the light of an interference with the rights of white men to obtain labour, and they are prepared to work in any direction that will attain their object. Are they honest when they say that they want to consider the question from a humanitarian and Christian point of view

                    (Tasmania).- On the grounds of justice and humanity, I" feel that I ought to vote for the amendment. Had not that been my opinion, I should have been driven to that conclusion by the remarks of Senators McGregor and Higgs. Even though we may have been doing wrong for years in permitting the immigration of kanakas, that is no reason why we should turn them out at a moment's notice. They have obtained certain rights by corning to Australia ; they have been . of use to us in our industries, and we have grown wealthy by their labour. By all means, let us cease permitting the importation of kanakas, but do not let us say to them that they must quit the country at once.
                    has pointed out that a great number of kanakas are depositors in the Savings Bank. The figures show that out of 9,000 kanakas considerably more than a third are thrifty, saving men. If, when they have saved a little money they care to go back to their islands with their boxes of toys, or their clothes, or tomahawks, or whatever they like* to buy, let them go; but if
                    of them like to stay and live under the conditions of higher civilization which we have taught to them, and want to be permanent labourers in Queensland, why prevent them ?
                    says - "Let them go back to be taught by the missionaries. " Does the honorable senator forget that there are 3,000 out of these 9,000 kanakas, in Queensland who are attending classes, conducted by missionaries and school masters there
                    Three thousand of them are pledged teetotallers, and does it not seem, therefore, that more than one-third of these are men whose example might be followed by the whites? I think that all these tilings go to show that although we desire to get rid of the kanakas, and do not want them to compete with the white workers and break down wages, we have no desire to do any injustice to them. It appears to me, however, that we shall inflict an injustice upon them if we do not carry this amendment. Do honorable senators really think that although this clause provides that we may deport the kanakas, Ministers are going, against the will of the black men, to charter a ship and send them away
                    I do not believe that they will do anything of the kind. Even if the clause remains unaltered, I still doubt whether they will have the power to do it.. I have been thinking over this matter in reference to. the definition of " Pacific Island labourer " in other Acts on this subject, but not in this measure - wrongfully, I think - which excludes those who are under the jurisdiction of any other civilized power. Supposing, for example, that these kanakas, were under the sovereignty of Germany, or that we were dealing with 9,000 Chinese under the Chinese Emperor. If we had the desire to deport them, does any one say we should have the power to- do so ? Is there no such thing as the comity of nations ? If we were to treat harshly men' belonging to a sovereign power, perhaps we would have to answer for our action.. The very fact, that kanakas have n©&gt; one- to protect them should lead us to be the first to defend their rights.

                        <para>- Yes, but they may become acclimatised. We know that the death rate has been enormous among the kanakas in Queensland, and it is admitted that the whole traffic has been cruel. It seems to me that it is very illogical to say that these people shall not have the option of coming in, and to say at the same time that those who have already come in under contract may stay if they desire to do so. We should keep them to their contract. They came here on the understanding that they would remain for a certain time, and then be deported. </para>

                        <para>- At all events it would have the effect of benefiting the planters, and of carrying out their desires. I hope the Senate will not vitiate the whole effect of the Bill by allowing half of the kanakas now in Queensland to remain there. Influence will be exercised on these men in order to keep them in the country. They may be fined and ill-used, and have their money taken from them so that they will not be able to leave Queensland. They will be kept here by every means possible, with the result that we shall have a hybrid population growing up, when the men who came here under contract should really have been deported at the end of their term. </para>

                    has urged with great vehemence the plea of justice. Justice will be done by carrying out the agreements. When two parties enter into an agreement, it is only right and proper that they should carry it out. In this instance, the planters or their agents have entered into agreements with the kanakas, one of the conditions of which is that the latter shall be sent back to their island homes.

                    tries to be fair upon all occasions, but on this occasion he has failed to give due weight to the matter of the re-engagement of the kanakas in Queensland. All the honorable senator has said about kanakas being engaged for a term is correct, with this exception, that after that term is terminated they have the right of reengagement for a further period.

                        <para>- That is so, but at the end of the second period, they may enter into a new agreement for a third period. I see that last year over 4,000 whose engagement had expired entered into new engagements for further periods, and they could not under the law of Queensland have been deported. I imagine that many of the 4,000 who re-engaged last year had previously re-engaged several times. How long they have resided in Queensland we do not know, but some of them may have been there for over ten years. In the case of men who have resided in Queensland for such a length of time, it does seem but the barest justice that we should deal with them in something like the same wa3r as we deal with aliens generally, and we should not desire to take the power to deport them with or without their will. Reviewing the whole of the circumstances of the traffic, and the conditions under which kanakas reside in Queensland, I hope the committee will do what is fair, and agree to the amendment. </para>

                        says that justice requires that a contract shall be carried out, but if the parties to the contract wish for a variation of its terms, is it an injustice to prevent it ? The honorable senator says that the kanakas came in of their own accord, and that they must, not go out of their own accord, and that is his idea of justice. Another honorable senator talked of the missionaries, and what they have done for the poor kanakas, and would do for them if they were sent back to their own islands. Many of us heard
                        who is the greatest authority, as a missionary, in regard to the kanakas, and he beseeched us with tears in his eyes not to send some of these poor men back, because in some cases it would mean their ruin. Their lands are gone, their wives, if they had any, are gone, in some cases they have lost their language, all home ties have been broken, and the best thing for them would be to leave them where they are, if they wish to remain. There are very few of them, I think at most 4,000, who have money in the bank, and we know that
                        of Fairymead; who is one of the largest employers of black labour, says that nothing will induce a boy to remain in Australia if he once takes it into his head to go back to his island. The great majority of them wish to go back. They are like children, and they like to sport themselves in fine feathers, and take little trinkets and presents for the friends they have left behind them. But those who have lost their friends do not want to go back, and why in the name of justice should we deport them from our shores to their detriment, when their remaining here would do us no injury? I do not believe that the handful of kanakas who would remain could do any injury to the Commonwealth. I shall support the amendment.

                    <para>Is it a crime for a mau to have a black skin ? Is it advisable, or is it possible, to have a white Australia ? Nature says it is impossible. There is no land under heaven with the variety of climate as found in Australia, where all labour is done by white-skinned men. If the leaders are persuaded that it is advisable to have a white Australia, should the beginning not be made at the most difficult place first ? There are in Melbourne nearly 1,000 American blacks. Let the Federal Government take these men from their positions as hotel-keepers, waiters, cooks, &amp;c, hire a couple of large ships, and deport them to America, and see how such action would result. America would send them back, accompanied by two or three of her best battleships. A message something like this would be given - "Gentlemen, - Put these men back into the positions from which you have taken them. Compensate them for every hour of time they have lost, or we will bombard Melbourne." And sooner than insult the Stars and Stripes, Australia would eat humble pie. Even if it was advisable, a white Australia is an impossibility. What are we to do with the native blacks, the Chinese, the Hindoos, the Syrians, the Cingalese? Many of the kanakas have been in the country for over twenty years, and are. they to be dealt with now as criminals ? They are as well-behaved as any labouring man in the community, and, as a rule, are trustworthy, will work faithfully in the absence of overseers, and will keep faith with one another. They have a sort of freemasonry among them, and may be trusted not to tell tales on one another. If any other nation but Britain had a protectorate over their country, Australia would not dare to brand as criminality the fact of a man being born in Polynesia. But does not the fact of Britain having established a protectorate over these islands confer any citizen rights on the natives of these islands ? I trow it does. If any nation made a claim to these islands Britain would go to war to establish her protectorate, and will Britain allow her people to be branded as felons because they have black skins ! I trow not. </para>

                    <para>Not so long ago, some part of Cairns awakened to the fact that it was quite a creditable thing to permit a horde of Japanese prostitutes to openly ply their shameful calling in a British town. Amongst " smart business men " and the like, who manage affairs, and do not stop to worry their heads over that which ranks under the denomination of public morals, a few persons, evidently imbued with some old-fashioned ideas still much prized by the race to which we belong, tried to assert inconvenient and quite unbusinesslike  principles. The local municipal body was approached by petition, and asked to suppress the Japanese brothels. The people of Cairns do not forget the excitement which this awakening and surprising movement caused in their midst, nor what remarkable factors operated to produce the division of opinion caused by the attack upon this particular "vested interest" of the north. . . My purpose, however, in these articles is to state what I honestly believe to be the truth regardless of persons, and the truth is that those who, from mere mercenary self-interest, resisted the effort to improve the public morality of Cairns, are a quite insignificant few. Yet, the fact remains that the petitioners failed, and the local council, on the casting vote of the chairman, decided to retain the Japanese prostitutes. Upon what ground ? Simply and solely on the ground that, having regard to the number of kanakas and other coloured aliens in the district, as a measure of public safety the Japanese women could not be spared ! </para>

                    <para>We are bound to look at all the surrounding circumstances of the case. The climate north of Townsville is essentially tropical, the scrubs are in impenetrable jungle, and, from the evidence placed before the commission, it is evident that it will cost an enormous amount of money to clear them, and render the land available for agricultural purposes. Further, immediately the scrub is cleared, malaria arises, seriously detrimental to the health of Europeans, and destructive to human life, as has already been proved in the construction of a line of railway going from Mourilyan plantation to Mourilyan harbor. It is the opinion of all who have had experience of the districts north of Townsville that the dense scrubs of the Johnstone, and the Barron, and the Tully, and the Russell cannot be cleared by European labour. </para>

Anyone could see this month several gangs of Hindoos coming in and going out on the north coast line. I say that these Hindoos are the most fifthy dirty race of men that I ever came across - the kanaka is a gentleman compared to them. They have no cleanliness, and the stench that arises from them, as you experience when you meet a gang of them in the street, is enough to turn you sick. I know that some employers, in their anxiety to get their cane in, employ them rather than wait until they can get some one else, because the}reckon that if they wait they may lose by keeping their cane standing in the ground. </para>

My opinion is that the European cannot do continuous manual labour in such a country. Some might be able to stand it for a short period with the result that they would have to return to a southern climate to recover their health, which it would take years to do. Take one hot day in Victoria, which is a temperate climate, and what complaints of the dreadful heat, yet many talk of Europeans becoming accustomed to the enduring of the sun's heat, 130 degrees to 150 degrees, as if it were nothing. </para>

                    <para>In the tropics there is no working before sunrise or after sunset. The red heat of the sun and light come and go together. It surprises me that no mention is made of the Brazilian case, to show how unsuitable the country that can produce coffee and sugar is for European settlement. About 18G8 a company advertised the wonderful capabilities of a district in Brazil, which grew coffee and sugar, for European settlement. Some hundreds of Englishmen with their families went there. Some years pass, and then there are accounts in the papers of the trials, privations, and deaths Of those who had been duped to emigrate to the same district from Wales. If the part of Australia north of 23£ degrees south latitude is to be permanently settled it can only be done by giving it up to those people who can work and rear families in tropical countries wholly governed by Europeans. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to enter into any discussion as to the way in which the employment of Polynesians differs from the employment, of the negro in the Southern States of America, but there they had a colour line, and we know what it led to. The Missouri compromise was hailed by a great number of people as a solution of the existing difficulties, and one which would enable peace to be preserved, but we know that, as a matter of fact, it did not solve any difficulty, and it precipitated the war. </para>

                        <para>- A Tariff is generally imposed with the understanding that it shall stand for some considerable time. Some honorable senators have drawn attention to the large amount of money which is involved in this preferential duty, and have expressed the opinion that it is making almost too large a sacrifice for this purpose. If that is so, can we, in reason, ask the people of Australia to extend that protection to the growers of cane by means of coloured labour for another five years after the expiry of the term proposed in this Bill? </para>

                        <para>- Practically. We are giving this protection to the employers of coloured labour, not because we want sugar to be grown by means of coloured labour, but because we recognise the difficulties of the planters in substituting one class of labour for the other. But it is going too far to ask the people of Australia to consent to a margin of import duty, which would mean giving this benefit to the growers of sugar by means of coloured labour for a further period of ten years. </para>

But at present it simply means that a heap of money is going to be put into the pockets of those who have not earned it, and are not entitled to it, and who have been able to compete on even terms with the sugar of the world. Is not that statement true? </para>

The Queensland sugar comes to Melbourne on precisely the same terms as does sugar from Mauritius, Java, and other parts of the world. If one goes to the wholesale houses - Messrs. James Service and Company or Messrs. William Peterson and Company - he will see upon the table all kinds of sugars.

If it is true that Queensland sugar has been able to compete with Java sugar grown by means of labour paid at the rate of 3d. per day and under no restrictive laws at all, it needs no bonus.

                        <para>- A protective duty never does good to the export trade. No one says it can do good. A protective duty, for instance, could not do any good to the wheat export trade. The bonus which the Government intend to pay will simply be for the benefit of the sugar-growers in the south of Queensland and in the north of New South Wales, whilst their policy will ruin the growers of Northern Queensland. I hold that the policy of the Government is devoid of wisdom and statesmanship, and will redound to the discredit of those who are responsible for it. Time will tell who is right in this matter. I have founded my opinions upon a long experience of the affairs of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That is not a relevant interjection. I am comparing the small manufacturers in the south with men who are riveted to the soil, and have been put there at the instance of a Government of a State. They have invested their money to the extent of six or seven millions in an industry which has been encouraged and built up at the instance of the Government. If any class should be encouraged and lauded, it is the men who are on the soil - the primary producers. </para>

                        <para>- It is nothing of the sort, because there will be kanakas north and south of the line at the same time, and when the period fixed comes to an end, the Government will be at liberty to deport the whole of them. The colour line adopted in America was a colour line pure and simple, because it was proposed that there should be no slaves at all north of the line. </para>

                <para>You urge that -if the labour traffic is wrong, the Bill is wrong. If the question had been whether such a traffic ought now to begin, this Government would have proposed legislation under which its inception would have been impracticable. But interests have grown up which you yourself are anxious to conserve. This Government recognises that a sudden ending alike of licences and of agreements would cause suffering to your own people, outweighing in its intensity the immediate advantage of the cessation. You cannot well argue that the justice of setting limits to a wrong necessitates, as a logical sequence, the further wrong of making the process unjust and cruel. It would certainly not have been humanity or statesmanship so to act ; and if this is a wrong traffic I am not impelled, either by reason or conscience, to transgress such principles of action in removing it. </para>
