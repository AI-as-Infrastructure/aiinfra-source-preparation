I presume that the Senate will provide that a roll shall be signed by each member. </para>

                        <para>- The business that has been done has been business absolutely necessary, such as the fixing of the next time of meeting.

                <para>
                    (New South Wales).It appears to me also that the course proposed by
                    is the better course under the circumstances. The consideration of the standing orders will give rise to a considerable amount of debate. There is a number of standing orders which I am  perfectly sure many honorable members will feel it incumbent upon them to vote against, at any rate to debate,' and debate at considerable length. So I do not think that we would be saving time or helping ourselves at all by taking this business, and, as
                    points out, it is an unusual thing for a Government to do more business than is absolutely formal and necessary before the Address in Reply is adopted. In this case, supposing any difficulty does arise it has been laid down by the Privy Council that you, sir, have the same powers as the chairman of a public meeting would have, and those powers would enable you, if honorable members were to misbehave so badly as to necessitate "their removal, to have them removed from the chamber. So I think, with such drastic power in your hands at the present time, it is hardly conceivable that there will be any difficulty arising in connexion with the carrying on of the business so far as dealing with the Address in Reply is concerned.- Of course, the ordinary rules of debate and the ordinary rules that guide public meetings in regard to amendments will be taken cognizance of here, so that I cannot conceive that there is any necessity to consider these standing orders at the present time. What necessity is there to pass a standing order, for instance, to the effect that a senator who has spoken to the main question shall not be allowed to. speak to an amendment on the main question? That, I believe, is in the standing orders submitted last week. Whether they have been revised since then, I do not know. There are other standing orders in regard to moving the adjournment of the Senate which are not likely to come up at all while we have this debate pending, and this debate no doubt will be given precedence to day after day, if it is going to last more than a day, until it is absolutely concluded, when we shall take up this ordinary business, which, I submit, will legitimately come forward at that particular time.

                    <para>- It appears to me that this is a question of not only convenience, but also constitutional usage. So far as convenience is concerned, I am disposed ;to agree with the senator who made the suggestion just now ; but, so far as constitutional usage is concerned, I have always understood that practically we ought to do no business at all until the Address in Reply has been agreed to. We are really not properly constituted for the purpose of doing other business until we have got a message from the Throne and sent a message in reply. From the point of view of convenience it does seem a little anomalous that we should do anything without settling some standing orders under which we may proceed. But the constitutional usage, I think, must take precedence of questions of convenience. After all, the standing orders are matters for ourselves, and we shall make such standing orders in the interim as are necessary to procure the proper, and, I think, the decorous, discharge of the business attendant on the Address in Reply. </para>

                    (New South Wales -Vice-President of Executive Council) in reply. - In taking the course I have done, I have followed what I think is admitted to be the unvarying constitutional usage. I quite assent to a good deal that has been said by
                    Symon as to the inconvenience of proceeding without standing orders, but, having regard to the nature of the debate which will take place, I think the inconvenience is likely to be more imaginary than real. I hope, and I see no reason to believe that the hope will not be realized, that there will be no practical inconvenience resulting from not having standing orders constituted in the ordinary way. But there is another reason why I have postponed this motion. On looking into these standing orders more critically than it had been possible for me to do before, I found that there are many of them which the Senate ought not to be asked to take for granted without debate, many of them giving very stringent powers. There are others of them which I think are new to honorable members, and there are some of them which seem to be a little contradictory in themselves. It appeared to me that it would be unwise and unfair to the Senate to ask them to adopt, under a general motion of this kind,- standing orders which are open to so much objection. I have gone through these standing orders very carefully, and I intend to strike out a number of them, to amend some of them, and to lay the amended draft on the table. That will be done to-morrow; and, when it is done, I propose to alter Notice of Motion No. 4, so as to make the adoption of the amended standing orders the subject of that notice. I think then there will be a code of standing orders which, while they will provide everything that is necessary, will not make any undue call upon the consideration or patience of the Senate. The standing orders will be laid on the table tomorrow, and will be distributed as soon as possible, so that by the time the motion is made which I intend to submit honorable members will be in possession of the standing orders, and they will know what alterations have been made. I hope to avoid discussion as much as possible in dealing with these provisional standing orders, because they will be referred to a standing orders committee, who will go into the matter very fully ; and there must be another discussion when the standing orders are brought up for final adoption. I am framing these standing orders, and including such standing orders only as will, I think, pass without discussion. Perhaps it is as well that the matter was raised now, because it has enabled me to make this explanation, which, I think, will satisfy the Senate that not only is there constitutional ground for the course which has been taken, but that it is a course which is really in the interests of the House itself.

                            <para>- Every ship in Germany is more or less subsidized by the Government, and the same system prevails in France and Japan, and other countries. The next most powerful company to be compared with the North German Lloyd Steamship Company is the British India Steamship Company, well known to the Queensland representatives. They own 122 steamers, representing 328,000 tons. All these German, French, and American ships go to British ports, and pay the same dues that a Britishship pays, while, if a British ship goes to a foreign port, she pays double dues. I' say, as a British subject, without the- slightest intention of offending a foreign subject or nation, that that is not fair in my opinion. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, the remedy is in our own hands ; but I say that that does not appear to me to be fair. The very ship that trades between Yokohama and Vancouver is, as I am informed, subsidized to the extent of the hands on board and the coal she consumes. Even that little nation Japan started a company in 1885, the Nippon Ushen Kiasha, which owns 68 steamers, with a total tonnage of 220,000 tons ; and in this morning's paper you will see telegraphic references to the strenuous efforts that Germany is making in regard to her shipping. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly; it is not the kind of charity that turneth the other cheek. Now, another matter referred to in the Governor-General's speech is that very difficult and disputable one of the Customs and Excise Bill. That is a measure that will create a great deal of heartburning, I have no doubt; but we have got to face it. We must have a revenue of at least ?8,500,000. The new expenditure of the Commonwealth is estimated at from ?350,000 to ?500,000. There are intercolonial duties yielding about a million of money that will be lost to the State Treasurers ; that in itself is a very large sum, and provision has also to be made for the surplus which New South Wales will have over and above what she has been accustomed to get. Under a Commonwealth Tariff, New South Wales undoubtedly will have a surplus revenue of from half to three-quarters of a million. The last statistics to which I have been able to refer give the revenue from Customs and Excise as ?1,600,000, and we in this State have ?2,200,000 or ?2,300,000. </para>

                            <para>- We all have deficits, and we cannot throw stones in that respect. At any rate, we mean to be fair to each other. New South Wales will have a surplus revenue from the Federal tariff of from ?500,000 to ?750,000. The new expenditure of close on ?500,000 and the surplus revenue of New South Wales will run into a large sum of money, probably about ?2,000,000, which will have to be derived from oversea goods, and it will therefore be compulsory that the Tariff should be a stiff one in order to raise that amount, considering that there is to be a free list. There must be a free list, and the probability is that it will be enlarged instead of being curtailed. </para>

                            <para>- I was not one of the candidates who spoke of direct taxation during the election campaign. Our direct taxation is heavy enough already, and we must raise our revenue from Customs and Excise, and other sources. At any rate, I say that there is a vast sum of money, amounting to about ?2,000,000, which has to be provided for, and it will compel the Federal Government to put on high duties. No other duties will raise the revenue, and let me remind the senators here present that if there is not sufficient revenue receivable by the Federal Treasurer to pay back to the State Treasurers the money to which they have been accustomed to look for, for the payment of interest on debentures and other loans, then there will be no possible means by which the State Treasurers can raise money, except by direct taxation. </para>

                            <para>- Nor in the other States. I am speaking more particularly of this State, of which I am a representative. Therefore we must have ?8,500,000 to enable the Federal Treasurer to pay back to the State Treasurers an amount sufficient to pay interest upon their loans. That is a matter which cannot be ignored. As I have said, Victoria's contribution in 1898-9 was ?2,225,222 from Customs and Excise; New South Wales' ?1,660,333, Queensland's ?1,569,015, South Australia's ?641,081, Western Australia's ?859,915, and Tasmania's ?447,036 ; making a total of ?7,402,602. Apart from that, the people of this State, as I have often said before, and the people of Australia generally, excepting perhaps in some parts of New South Wales, voted unanimously for the Commonwealth Bill. They did so in the full belief and confidence that the Federal Government would not create difficulties. Let me be either free-trader or protectionist, I say it would not be fair or honest for the Federal Government to break faith with a people who, in good faith, accepted the Commonwealth Bill believing they would be honorably treated. Therefore, I say that industries which have been encouraged by the various State Parliaments ought not to be injured. We ought not to destroy what Parliament has in its wisdom created. </para>

Another matter which is associated with our industries, is the question of bounties. I was hoping that the Government would have made some little reference to this subject. In this State bounties have been of much use. The butter business owes its origin to them. In my opinion, and in the opinion of the people of most of the States, the butter business but for bounties would not have been what it is to-day. It might have been years and years before it attained to its present position but for the bounties. </para>

                            <para>- And Ave get good jam too. I say that in the matter of the butter industry, bounties have certainly facilitated its growth. During the crisis which we had here and elsewhere, it was acknowledged that the butter business really saved this State, at any rate. It is a huge business, and a growing business. The old country takes ?15,000,000 worth of butter from all parts of the world every year. Up to the present we have only sent ?1,500,000 worth per annum, but there is no reason why we should not be able to send ?4,000,000 or ?5,000,000 worth of butter to London annually. To encourage it would be to spread prosperity throughout the whole land. I invite senators to visit the western district and Wangaratta. As soon as they put their feet on the soil where butter is produced they will at once acknowledge that prosperity follows butter. I assure you that has been so in the western district. Go to Colac or Camperdown, or travel to Wangaratta, and you will find wherever butter is produced land has risen in value and population has also increased. Instead of land being occupied as it was years ago by flocks of sheep, it is now covered by herds of cattle. Another matter to which I must refer while dealing with the question of bounties is that of coal. I remember the time, not many years ago, when it was asserted there was not a ton of coal to be found in Victoria. Through the passing of two short railway lines, one going to Jumbunna the other to Korumburra, we are now receiving 250,000 tons of coal per annum from Gippsland. A third of the coal consumed in Victoria is raised in Gippsland, two-thirds come from New South Wales. For twenty years it was asserted by high authority that coal did not exist here, but high authorities are not always correct. </para>

Now, in my humble opinion, it would be a good thing for the Federal Government, out of the savings which I hope it will make, to give a bonus of ?5,000 for the first 500 reapers and binders made in Australia. Farmers are paying ?50 and ?55 for machines when they can be made in the old country for a great deal less than half that amount. </para>

                            <para>- If the Government made them they would cost a lot more. In regard to this matter, I may say the day will come when the iron mines of New South Wales will astonish the world by their output, and while we are giving a bonus for one tiling in one State we might give a bonus in another, and so treat all fairly. The next item I wish to refer to is that of Posts and Telegraphs. I have read the statement drawn up by the Deputy Postmasters - General, and would commend it to those senators who wish to have some light reading. Their conclusions are, in my opinion, very absurd. I would recommend the Government to follow the example of Canada, by dividing the Commonwealth into ten or twelve or thirteen districts, and appointing an inspector for each - when there would be a spirit of emulation created amongst the officers of the department - instead of adopting the cut-and-dried ideas of officials, no matter how well intentioned they may be. No doubt it is a very difficult thing for the official mind to get out of the usual groove. In Canada the Post and Telegraph system is working very well. Large savings can be effected by-and-by in these departments by wise and good Government, and the public will be better served under the Commonwealth than it has been in the past. Our Postal department has often been condemned as badly managed, and frequent complaints are made by the public in letters to the press. I am afraid there has been some justification for them. The Telegraph department, instead of charging as at present, will no doubt charge according to mileage, dividing the continent into distances of 300, 400, or 500 miles. </para>

                            <para>- There has been a greater consumption of money in England than usual. Whatever the reason, money is cheaper in New South Wales, which presumes to be a free-trade State, than it is in London. I see no hope, therefore, of making savings at present, but that condition of affairs cannot last long. We are paying large sums to the London and Westminster Bank for collecting our coupons ; -we are paying ?250 per ?1,000,000 for that work. Money has been borrowed recently in Australia - I refer to the Treasury Bills of Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria - some ?500,000 in each State, and it has been borrowed cheaper than it could have been obtained at home. I hope the day is not far distant when all the borrowing required for the Commonwealth will be done in Australia, and done cheaper and better than it could be at home. The Treasurer could do the agency business instead of paying large sums for that work. If money happens to be cheaper in London, it will be invested through agents here instead of us going to London to borrow, so that it would be much better for the Commonwealth to obtain its loan moneys locally. A saving of half per cent, in the money borrowed for the whole Commonwealth (the total indebtedness is about ?190,000,000) would mean close on ?1,000,000 a year all told. When money becomes cheaper at home, that is the direction in which the Government ought to travel. . It should be possible for the renewals and conversions, at any rate, to be obtained at a much lower price. We have four and a half and five per cent, loans, while in some few cases a still higher price is paid, and if we can save half per cent, it will mean close on ?1,000,000 a year. There are some ?10,000,000 of our State loans maturing in London during the next seven years. </para>

                            <para>- The Bill is not before me just now. It is too early to give an expression of opinion. Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof. I hope it will be provided for, at any rate, because it is an industry that is indigenous to that part of the Commonwealth ; and there are millions of acres yet available for the extension of the business. Queensland is suffering, and make no mistake, its deficit will be a very large one, and the Federal Treasurer possibly will be called upon to help in that direction. It will be the duty of the Federal Treasurer to help any State that is in temporary financial difficulty. So far as Queensland is concerned, undoubtedly the difficulty will pass away, but the effects of the drought there will last for years, because the country is devoid of stock to breed up with. The sugar industry is one of the industries which are now keeping that State going. So far as the kanakas are concerned, I repeat here what I have said on the platforms. I do not think there is much danger of the whites of Queensland and the kanakas mixing together. The blacks of Australia and the whites of Australia never did mix together. </para>

                            <para>- I say so, too. I do not think there is very much danger of the blacks and whites mixing together, but if there is a danger of that occurring I would guard against it. I am in favour of industrial disputes being settled on fair lines. A patent law of course is a law which would be of great advantage to the Commonwealth generally. The question of old-age pensions is to be dealt with in the future. In this State we legislated on the subject in a very great hurry. We have a justification now for saying that the measure was passed too hastily. The Act is not working as was expected. I believe that the senators here and the Commonwealth Parliament will agree to grant old-age pensions when the Bill is brought forward. It is far better for the Federal Parliament to deal with this subject than the State Parliaments. If an applicant for an old-age pension here has spent ten years in one State and ten years in another State, or has spent five years in each of four States as the case may be, he is not eligible because, according to the law of Victoria, a man has to spend twenty years in the. State. It is ridiculous to say that because a man here has spent his time in the other States, and has given every guarantee of good citizenship, he is not as eligible for a pension as if he had spent the whole twenty years in this State. It is a question which should be dealt with by the Federal Parliament, and the experience we have gained in this State will be of great value to the Federal Government, because they can avoid many mistakes we have made here. In this State the applications were heard in secret, which was a great mistake, as imposition was carried on without the public knowing anything about it. </para>

                            <para>- I am thankful for the interjection. I am totally opposed to the Asiatics.' I would not consider them, but time, of course, must be given for men to put their houses in order. I quite agree with the statement made in the Governor-General's speech so far as Asiatics and Hindoos are concerned, that when the agreements expire they should not be renewed. From what I can learn, I do not think there is any necessity for it. There is only the matter of the railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie which I have not touched upon. I happen to have been a member of the firm that built a railway from Port Augusta to Government Gums some years ago. I spoke against this proposal during my campaign. This is not the time to speak at length on the question. Of course it is a proposal for a federal expenditure. Before the Federal Government agree to an expenditure of, say, ?3,000,000, they ought to have ample evidence that it is justified. I hope that the time for speechifying is gone, and that we are now face to face with hard work. I shall be very glad indeed when we have before us some of the Bills that the Government have promised. I shall give the Government all the support I can in hastening those measures through the Parliament. I than lc the Senate for the patient hearing I have received. </para>

In regard to the position of the committee it was understood that it was to be composed entirely without reference to parties or to the supporters of the Government. It has been the invariable practice, in some States, at any rate, to have the leader of the Opposition in the House of Assembly placed on the committee, the object being to insure a reply to the Address of a purely formal character. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator who followed him gave us a very temperate and reasoning speech, that afforded plenty of food for thought. It would be quite impossible for any senator to go through all the subjects mentioned in the address. There are, however, two or three matters which are of primary and paramount importance, so far as the interests of the Commonwealth are concerned. The most important part of the speech at the present time is that which deals with the Tariff; but there are other very important matters embodied in it which will give food for a great deal of thought. Honorable members have expressed themselves in favour of a white Australia. No doubt it will be very hard to find any man in the whole Commonwealth, occupying any prominent position, who would do otherwise than avow his belief in a white Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We want to see our own people remain for all time as the dominant residents of the whole of Australia. I do not think there is very much question with regard to legislation dealing with Asiatics. The matter which seems to be giving the greatest trouble is in relation to the way in which the kanaka question shall be dealt with. Many of us say it is impossible to have a white Australia unless every kanaka is banished from its borders, as well as the Asiatics and other coloured people. Now I say that unless it can be shown clearly and conclusively that the sugar industry cannot be conducted in Australia with white labour, the kanaka ought to go. But we are told - I am not pronouncing any opinions to its correctness - that the effect of employing kanaka labour is to provide a great deal of additional employment for white men. </para>

                            <para>- That has to be proved either one way or the other. If it can be shown that the white mau can do the work in the field as well as the kanaka, then that is a reply; and the kanaka should go. But if the kanaka is employed for the purposes of increasing the work of the white men, then there will have to be most stringent regulations in order that there may be no difficulty and trouble occurring in the future in regard to our white Australia. It is said the matter may be likened to this : that as it is necessary to employ horses and cattle, and we thereby provide much more labour for men, so it is necessary to employ the kanaka. If that be so, then I dare say you will find that the working men will want to keep him here. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps when we are talking about horses and asses I may give you my views upon them. A great deal of the debate will centre around the question of the proposals of the Government in regard to the fiscal policy. While this part of the speech is to a certain extent vague and moderate in its terms, nevertheless if members will take care to regard it carefully, the}' will find that there is a dominating principle underlying the views of the Government, as expressed by the Governor-General's speech, which is indicative of a strong protective feeling. Of course we know that honorable members composing the Government ore at heart protectionists, and I think there is hardly one of them who would care to deny that those are his opinions - that he is a thorough believer in the principles of protection, a,nd. it is only by force of circumstances that he is prepared to abandon those principles that he believes would be in the best interests of the country generally. We are told that he abandons those principles because there is a necessity to raise a certain amount of revenue, and that if they impose too heavy a duty they will probably interfere with the amount of revenue which they would otherwise collect. We see in this speech that the object is not only to secure a reasonably sufficient return of surplus revenue to each State, so as fairly to observe the intention of the Constitution, but to avoid the unnecessary destruction of sources of employment. No doubt we all agree that it is not desirable to destroy sources of employment unnecessarily. But the question is whether the ' adoption of a low - grade Tariff as against a high-grade Tariff will be the means of destroying industries that are already in existence in the country, and which are adaptable to the wants and requirements of the States generally. On this matter I think that honorable members who sit on this side of the chamber and entertain similar opinions to what I do join issue with the Government. We say there is no necessity for any special provision of this character. I know that in Victoria there is a strong and widespread feeling in favour of the system of protection. I believe that men who are advocating this system do so honestly, because they conceive that it will be the best policy in the interests of their own State, and therefore the best policy in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth.

That is one of the little bunker arguments you hear occasionally doled out to people from the hustings - that she built up her industries under protection. Do not people who take the trouble to read know that there was enough poverty, destitution, and wretchedness in England before she adopted this system of freedom of trade ? When she had a protectionist policy it dragged her people down to the lowest depths of degradation. </para>

                            <para>- So you will, and it is absurd to say that that is the cause of it. It is attempted to be shown that England's industries are on the decline. I contend that her industries are not on the decline. If honorable members will take the trouble to look at the statistics, and see what her position is to-day, they will find that it is not losing ground at all. I had an extract the. other day, from one of the British trade journals, in which it was pointed out that the year 1900 had been one of the best years that England had known so far as the labours of her working men were concerned. We heard 'to-day about the commerce of Germany and the commerce of Prance, and we were also told that the whole of it had been built up - how? - by draining money out of the pockets of the taxpayers of the country so as to subsidize a few lines of steam-ships in order that they may fight against the commerce of Great Britain, that stands absolutely on its own bottom. </para>

                            <para>- Her commerce has been built up to such a position that to-day Great Britain does the greatest carrying trade of any nation in the world. You may build up a system by your bounties ; you may subsidize all your steam-ship companies ; but the question is, are you not taking money out of the pockets of the people of your country unjustifiably ? Is it for the benefit or the advantage of the people of the country to pay these enormous subsidies to the steam-ship owners simply because they are trading between different parts of the world and attempting to develop commerce ? </para>

                            <para>- They are doing it in Germany, we are told. They are not doing it in Great Britain, and we know that Great Britain is still the carrying power of the world, small a country as she may be, and that her population has increased year by year by large numbers. True, a great many people leave the old country, but they necessarily do so, because of its limited area. They must go to populate other portions of the world. Do we not owe our position to the population that has come away from the old country to settle these States, and to push us along as they have done? But while I take the case of Great Britain, I can come closer home. I can reply to some of the suggestions made in the opening speech about destroying industries, by quoting the example of the State of New South Wales. There is New South Wales, with one of the freest Tariffs in the world - a Tariff which has not been in existence for a few months, but for years. </para>

                            <para>- I believe it has recovered from its state of anti-biliousness. It is all right again I believe. It is a free-trade newspaper, .whatever it may have been on federation. In the State of New South Wales we find that there were five of the men of the free-trade bunch returned, and that there was not a protectionist within 25,000 or 30,000 votes of the lowest number of votes polled by the representative of the freetrade party. There was the protectionist bunch of half-a-dozen with my honorable and learned friend opposite at its head. He obtained his position not because he was a protectionist, but because of his own personality, and the belief of the people, and a well justified belief, that he was a man that the country would be pleased to see in Parliament by virtue of his education and position and his character and conduct generally. We were told a little time ago that all our industries in New South Wales would be destroyed. I have taken the trouble to look up the statistics, and I find that in the year 1895, that is the. year before the free-trade Tariff came into operation, New South Wales had 43,000 odd persons employed in her manufacturing industries, and that in 1899 the number had increased to 55,000 persons, that is, by 12,000 souls. We had this advantage in the State of New South Wales, that we had a larger number of males employed in our manufacturing industries than had Victoria, while we admit that Victoria doubled the number of female hands employed in her factories. I have taken the trouble to go a little further. I find, according to the latest statistics, that New South Wales has still further improved her position, that she has now upwards of 60,000 souls employed in her manufacturing establishments, as against 50,000 souls employed in the previous year, and that while we had 2,912 manufacturing industries then, we have 3,075 manufacturing industries now. And remember that these are all taken on the one basis in both Victoria and New South Wales. We find now that they are practically on a level. But we want to go even further. In. a country like this ought we not to look to our primary industries in our early stages, and to see what are the natural industries to the country. The industries that are natural to Victoria employ upwards of 21,000 persons, and the industries natural to New South Wales upwards of 29,000 persons. But where they come into competition with imported goods there are 34,000 employed in Victoria as against 22,000 employed in New South Wales. We will say, for the sake of argument, that the employment of these 12,000 additional men is due to the protective policy of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- That is the old cry, but how much wool is used in the country ? The wool is sent away to the old country to be manufactured, and look at the time it takes to be manufactured. There is an industry in which a man gets no benefit at all from this policy. You can go round the whole of the industries in that way. Take the farmer. What benefit does he get? He produces wheat, and he soon overtakes the local supply. Before he can do that, by means of a duty we manage to give him a little money, but at the same time we take that money out of the pockets of the bulk of the people in order that he may get a little benefit. The wheat production has overtaken the wheat consumption, and now the price of wheat here is regulated by the price of wheat in Mark Lane. Take any industry you- like in the country, and you will find that a protectionist policy will not benefit the people of the country at large. I maintain that it is undoubtedly a fiction when you say that by putting duties on different articles that can be produced in the country, by Virtue of the existence of those duties you are making your country more prosperous and better than it was before. If you like to take a plant from the tropics you can grow it at the South Pole so long as you give it plenty of heat ; but the moment you take the heat away it will die. So it is with some of these protected industries. I do not say it is so with all of them, but it is so with any industry which really is dependent on the principle of protection. Take the Tariff away, and your industry fades away and dies just as a plant dies which is taken out of a hot house. Of course I am not going to say I cannot understand how a man can be a protectionist, because I know that honorable members have looked at these questions. Men have given as full consideration to that side, I have no doubt, as they have to the other side, and they have come honestly to a conclusion; but I contend that it is a false conclusion, and it is not one which ought to weigh with the people of the country. I maintain that, so far as the people are concerned, while we cannot have an ideal free-trade Tariff the bulk of the people of Australia have supported men who are in favour of a revenue Tariff, and not men who are in favour of a high protective Tariff. With the exception of the State of Victoria I believe if a referendum was taken it would be found that the vast majority would be in favour of a purely revenue Tariff. </para>

                            <para>- There was a minority that were returned as protectionists. Even to-day in the State of Victoria there are one or two avowed free-traders who managed to get through. I would remind the honorable member that the State was divided into 26 particular districts. They returned several protectionist representatives to the Legislature, but that was no indication of how the State as a whole spoke on the matter. The Senate was elected by the whole of the people of New South Wales, and unquestionably if a referendum could be got the whole State would speak unmistakably in favour of free-trade. </para>

The country people gradually gravitate towards the city, and they have the. opportunity of changing: opinions with the citizens if those opinions are not in accordance with the best interests of the whole country. Taking the State of New South Wales, she has proportionately a larger population than the protective State of Victoria. Victoria has a far greater number of people centred in one or two places than the State of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to find that so many honorable members have come down to this principle that free -trade between the States is good. A large number will also tell you they are prepared to give a preferential Tariff with regard to British goods. Sixty-five per cent, of the importations into these States consist of British goods. If you give them preferential treatment, how are 3'ou going to raise the required revenue? We are glad to recognise that we are going to have intercolonial free-trade, because we know it is a step in the right direction, and I hope honorable members will see to it that they assist in pushing this business forward. We should back up the Government in putting their Tariff proposals before the country as early as possible. Once we have the matter settled, I hope it will remain settled for many years to come, whether it be a high Tariff or a low Tariff, because we know that nothing disturbs trade so much as uncertainty with regard to the fiscal position of the States. This matter is the real foundation upon which we are going to build up the success or the failure of the Commonwealth. We want a good solid foundation, and we do not want by-and-by to have to pull down our superstructure in order to put in a new foundation. When the Tariff is settled I hope it will remain for many years to come. It may take some time to do that, but we on this side of the Senate will do all in our power to bring it to a successful issue as early as possible. </para>

                            <para>- And allow members of the State Parliament to set their House in order as time goes by. I regard the settlement of this question as one of the vital matters in the interests of the Commonwealth. Once in our own home we will feel that we can legislate upon other matters in a much more satisfactory way than we can while we are in this uncertain position. We may be here for some years, or only a few years. It depends on the attitude of our Parliament itself, whether the time be long or short, and I hope it will be made a strong point by the people to urge their representatives in both Chambers to push the matter forward. Again, the Government have suggested various ways of spending large sums of money in the Governor-General's speech. For instance, the acquisition of the Northern Territory, the railway to Western Australia, and the question of old-age pensions. I do not suppose there is one who would not be glad to see the different States brought together by the iron bands of a railway line, but we have to consider the cost, and how are we going to meet it. Therefore, we have to be particularly careful what we do. I am told that a railway to Western Australia will cost ?5,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- If we are to build a railway at the cost of two or three millions we have not only to pay the expense of running it and maintaining it, but the interest on the money we borrow. Of course, I am told it is a national undertaking. I have always noticed that anything that will not pay, in the way of large public works, is put forward as a national undertaking. At any rate, I have noticed that in New South Wales, and I dare say it is so in the other States. We have to multiply the amount of interest on the loans at least by four, in order that we may return three-fourths to the States. Now we come to the question of old-age pensions. Victoria and New South. Wales both have their systems in force, and they will be able to give us a. great deal of knowledge when we come to deal with the question. According to Coghlan, we should require ?1,800,000 annually to pay old-age pensions to the people of the whole Commonwealth on the same basis as that in operation in New South Wales. The pension in New South Wales is10s. per week, and that is not a. very extravagant amount. If we are to spend money in this way we shall have to raise an additional ?7,000,000. We are practically precluded from direct taxation. That belongs to the States. </para>

                            (New South Wales).I do not like exactly that this initial debate should conclude without some small expression of opinion in addition to those which have, already fallen from the lips of the senators who have spoken. I own that my remarks will be brief, and I should have preferred to have made them a little later on rather than follow on the same side as
                            I must own to a feeling of very considerable dissatisfaction with the speech which was delivered by the Governor-General here last week. I must say that the speech is so positively nebulous, so entirely crowded with indication, so utterly composed of promises, that I cannot regard it as a satisfactory speech by which to open the proceedings of this Parliament.

No mau, no matter how enthusiastic he may be on the subject of a proper provision for the aged at the hands of the State, not as a charity, but as a State right - the right to live, the right to eat, and the right to be clothed - no man within the four corners of the Commonwealth of Australia can be more enthusiastic on this subject than I humbly believe myself to be. </para>

Of course, if it was an indication that this Chamber could be overridden or ignored while a double vote of the other House could settle the fate of a public servant, I should only regard it, as the honorable and learned gentleman himself says, as a ridiculous statement. It struck me as tending to discredit the power and authority of this Chamber, which, I take it, represents quite as satisfactorily the wishes of the people as the other Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- I have an amendment which I propose to submit later on, and one amendment at a time is sufficient to handle. I express the hope, and I am sure the common sense of the Chamber and the country will be with me, that in making future appointments the Government will as far as possible draw on the available material from the public services of the States, and that only on extraordinary occasions will they go beyond the public services and take recruits from outside. Now just a word on a subject upon which I addressed a question to the representative of the Government. It is as to an agreement said to have been made between the Federal Government and the Government of the State of Victoria. It is stated that there is a proposal to allow members of the State Parliament to have the use of certain rooms in this building. I shall say nothing more than that I conceive such an arrangement would not only be inconvenient but would create an amount of friction which would develop to a dangerous extent, and if the Government have any such intention I hope they will reconsider it. It would be far better for us to leave this building altogether and take refuge in the Exhibition building than to be parties to such an agreement. I have just one other minor matter upon which to touch, and that is as to the necessity for a federal electoral law. The speech makes some reference to it, but it does not give it that prominent position to which it is entitled. Probably honorable members coming from States possessing more common-sense electoral laws than those of New South Wales may not have had brought before them the urgent necessity for such a law; but in New South Wales, if it were possible for bungling to develop into a fine art, we can claim to have achieved it. I can hardly imagine that the ingenuity of man could have devised anything entitled to be called a law which contains such a maximum of inconvenience with a minimum of advantage. For that reason I trust the Government will at an early date provide an electoral law, the essential principle of which will be a common-sense method of working - a law under which electors shall have as little inconvenience as possible, and which will secure the largest percentage of votes at the ballot-box. </para>

The duty on sugar was certainly left on, not because we believed in it, but because the party having brought in a policy which provided for a gradual reduction of the sugar duty, had to face the position that federation would be an accomplished fact in a year or two, that the Federal Parliament would be dealing with the sugar duty, and that it would be unfair to our sugar-growers were the duty to be taken away if it had to be imposed again in a short time, the whole of it going to another colony. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; the people best qualified to speak have done so. The representatives of Queensland in the Federal Parliament are all strong anti-coloured labour men. It is important to know what is the opinion of those who are most affected by it. I believe in the State Parliament of Queensland every representative of the sugar districts is a white labour man. </para>

                            <para>- Well, I have been misinformed, or, probably, I have misunderstood my informant. At any rate, the members who come here from Queensland to represent the State, and who should know most about it, advocate this proposal. The employment of the kanaka is defended, I think, solely on the ground that the keeping of a few kanakas at work gives employment to a much larger number of white men. ? </para>

                            <para>- Whether it is nonsense or not, the white men affected have voted for the abolition of the kanaka. If they are willing to run the risk of having their business and their income struck away, surely those who are not personally affected can go with them. I want, in dealing with the question as to whether or not the kanaka is necessary, to point out this fact that, of late years, according to figures obtained from the Queensland statistical branch, there has been a rapid expansion of the area under sugar cane, without any increase in the number of "kanakas. In the*' year 1885 there were 59,000 acres under cane, and nearly 11,000 Pacific Islanders employed. In the year 1900, there were .1 OS, 000 acres under cane, and 9,000 Pacific Islanders employed. That practically means that the Pacific Islanders have decreased, and that the area under cane has doubled. Honorable members, I suppose, are aware of this fact, that the kanaka is only employed in the field, that he cannot work about the mills. I give the area under cane because that is the scene of his operations. If, in 1885, 11,000 Pacific Islanders were necessary - I do not contend that they were - for the cultivation of 59,000 acres under cane, and we have only the same number of kanakas now, and twice the area under cane, it is quite' evident that there are 50,000 acres being cultivated without the use of kanakas. That appears to me to be absolutely unnecessary. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member interjects that they have brought in any amount of machinery, but what to do ? The machinery does not cut the cane or work the fields either to any extent. The kanaka is limited entirely to work in the field. I repeat if the 11,000 kanakas were required for the cultivation of 59,000 acres, of cane in 1S85, there has been an area of' from 50,000 to 60,000 acres which has been cultivated since that year without the employment of kanakas. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that there, was subsequent legislation, and that perhaps some of its provisions were evaded. But even making allowance for a leakage of that kind, it is quite evident that a very large amount of land in Queensland has;, been brought under cultivation without the aid of kanaka labour. Senator Fraser spoke of some thousands of acres being suitable: for cane cultivation, all of which he said he hoped to see brought under cultivation.</para>

It is surely possible for the white labour, having already cultivated 50,000 acres, to cultivate the remaining 50,000 acres. I propose to submit a definite proposition to the House, and it is one the moderation of which I think will commend itself to honorable members whether they believe in the necessity of the kanaka or not.

                        <para>I propose, sir, to place an amendment in your hands which will provide for a gradual abolition of the coloured labour within the Commonwealth and for the immediate stoppage of its importation. That appears to me to be moderate in the extreme. It extends to vested interests a reasonable warning as to what is to take place, and it gives them, as I shall show in a minute, four and a half years in which to make other arrangements. Existing legislation in Queensland permits of a three years' -agreement between the employer and the kanaka, and the kanaka has the option of renewing his agreement if he likes. As the agreements have a three years' currency, we may assume that the average of them is eighteen months; that is, some of them are nearly completed, and some of them are only just made. Allowing only one term of renewal for the kanakas already there, it will give an average of four and a half years if my proposal is adopted before the kanakas entirely disappear. That, I submit, is a reasonable time and a reasonable warning to give to those who have imported them, and who are employing them.</para>

                        <para>I cannot think, in view of the figures I have, that the kanaka is at all necessary to the continued success of the sugar industry. But I go further than that, and say that if it did jeopardize that industry, there are other interests at stake which far overshadow it, and that it would be far better for us to be without the sugar industry if, in order to maintain it, we had to leave our ports open to the indiscriminate introduction of coloured labour. It is not merely a question as to whether or not these coloured races may intermix with our own. There is an equally serious matter, and it is that the introduction of inferior labour would, in my opinion, tend to degrade labour throughout the Commonwealth. It is for these reasons that I submit this amendment. I had hoped that the Government, in dealing with this matter, would, at least, have felt inclined to go as far as my amendment. I submit it not with any desire—an d I do not suppose it would do so—t o hamper the honorable and learned member in charge of Government business, but really because I cannot allow the Address in Reply to go without taking this step as giving me a practical means of putting forward the views I held.</para>

We feel that everything almost that is good that is ours to-day has been the gift of the motherland. When we look at the other countries of the world which enter upon colonizing work, we find that they generally colonize with the object of increasing the advantage to the mother, and seldom do that justice to the -daughter or son that we see done in the Australian colonies. On the other hand, we have received from Great Britain responsible government. We have received from Great Britain the right to make our own laws. We have received from her the right to impose duties even upon her own goods, leaving us absolutely free to develop ourselves in the way we think best in the interests of the people that are settled in Australia. Consequently, we welcome the Duke and Duchess of York as representatives of the community not only from which we have sprung, but from which we have received almost everything that is good, and almost all the political institutions under which we stand to-night.</para>

                            <para>I know that as soon as a colony arrives at a stage when it is practicable and reasonable for it to undertake the responsibility of self-government, Great .Britain has always been willing and ready to hand that responsibility over to the colony. I have nob the slightest hesitation in saying that Great Britain is the one country that does that which has made us so prosperous, that we have much to thank her for. I believe the people of Australia do thank her deeply and sincerely for the Constitution under which we now intend to live, and that the 103'alty they have shown to the motherland is not only lip-lbyalty but a loyalty which is the outcome of the affection which is bred and born out of the good actions we have received from the motherland in days gone by. A lesson we have learned from Great Britain, no doubt, is that we should not always endeavour to develop a young community or any portions of our dominion in the interest of a section of the people. We have learned the true spirit of federation. We have learned that the older portions of the Commonwealth can well afford, as Great Britain has done, to allow the smaller portions their just due, and allow them to develop themselves in the way which is desired. If we keep in our minds the object-lesson that has been taught that we should not allow our individual interests to stand in the way of national development, I believe that the future of this Commonwealth will be a great one. But if we allow, in the settlement of the site on which the federal capital is to be built, those provincial instincts which are so strong— I am sorry bo say between two of the colonies, in any event—t o have effect on our actions, I think it will be a poor day for the Commonwealth. We know, find we have heard that Now South Wales and Victoria have not been ready and willing to trust the Commonwealth Parliament to do that which they think is right; not because they thought that the Commonwealth Parliament would not do that which was right in the interests of the community, but because they believed that the interests of the community might be antagonistic to one or other of- those colonies. I hope that the senators and the members of the other House who come from States unaffected by these influences will see that the prejudices of New South Wales and Victoria are absolutely swept upon one side, and that we shall have a site when it is settled upon that will not be too remote, and that the city will not be built in the interests of either New South Wales or Victoria, but will be built and established in the interests of the Commonwealth and the people of Australia generally. We note, and I have no doubt with pleasure, that the Government intend to do that which is absolutely necessary. They intend to introduce a Bill to provide for the working of the Court of Appeal. I t is my hope that when this Bill is introduced we shall find that it is consistent with the Constitution, and that no action will be taken which has either a direct or an indirect tendency to weaken the power of appeal to the Privy Council.</para>

                            <para>The senator suggests that it is a personal consideration. I have no intention of considering whether he or anybody else has or has not the power to appeal to any court. The question is - i s it right that we should have the privilege of appeal to the Privy Council, or is it not? The reason why I think it is right is because it seems to me that it is eminently desirable that there should be a uniformity of law and decision throughout the British-speaking countries.</para>

                            <para>I am afraid that the interjections of the senator show that he knows little or nothing about that on which he is interjecting, because a Judge, whether he is a Judge of a court or a member of the Privy Council, has the same principles of law for his guidance ; his training is the same ; his ability to discriminate is the same. It is easy for the Judges at home to form the best possible opinion from a local point of view. After all the Judges on the Privy Council do not decide the facts of a case. The facts of a case are decided by the Judge or the jury who hear it in Australia, and it is only a consideration of legal principles that ever reaches the Privy Council. Is it not manifest to the honorable member whether he understands the .principles of law or whether he does not, that it is eminently desirable that in communities bound closely together, as the Commonwealth -of Australia is with the motherland, there should be no conflicting decision. The only way to avoid a conflicting decision is to have one final Court of Appeal, because if we have a final Court of Appeal in Australia, a final Court of Appeal in Canada, and a final Court of Appeal in the motherland, we shall probably find in days to come that they come to different decisions* on different legal principles, and although we belong to the one Empire, although we are really one people, the law will have one construction in the old country, and another construction -in Canada, and still another construction in Australia. There are those who are connected with trade and business, leaving the  lawyers entirely out of the question, who will see that from a business point of view, audi a condition of affairs will be disastrous, and therefore it is my sincere hope that no action the Government takes will ever tend in the direction of lessening the power of the Privy Council as a final Court of Appeal.</para>

                            <para>Suggestions have been made and debated and written upon by lawyers in this and other Houses, and I think now is the fitting time for one who is a lawyer to express the opinion he holds on the question. In a debate of this kind we are discussing the general issue. "We deal with everything that is of interest to us. A motion may be introduced to-morrow into the House of Representatives, having as its object the amendment of the Constitution, and X say I hope nothing of that kind will be done, but that the conditions as they exist at present will be strenuously maintained by the existing or any successive Government. I take the responsibility of seconding the amendment moved by Senator Milieu, and I do so because it is my firm conviction that an industry that is incapable of being developed except by means of influences and elements which must ultimately tend to national degradation is not an industry which we should desire to see in the Commonwealth of Australia. It is our desire that the population of Australia in the days to come shall be second to none in the civilized world, and how can that be if we continue to import people whose presence must degrade the community? They degrade not only from a national point of view, but also from a commercial point of view, because every one who has seen the result of black labour must know that the amount of money set in circulation through the medium of the industry is practically nothing. The benefit the community as a whole reaps from an industry is almost proportionate with the amount of labour employed and the remuneration paid, and if you introduce a class of labour which works on a pauper basis, a class of labour which creates no commercial prosperity, you produce a condition which will not bring about the state of things you desire. The value of an industry to this or any other country is the amount of money it sets in circulation in the community; and if we are going to have black labour in the Commonwealth, and Chinese cooks</para>

                            <para>The honorable member may know something about barmaids; I know something about kanakas and Chinamen. I know the effect they have on the community, and I feel confident that, from a national point of view, their presence is not desirable. Therefore, the object that a politician should have in view is to see that our industries are developed in the interests of the community, that they employ the class of labour that produces prosperity, and not the class of labour which tends towards pauperism. I feel confident that the presence of these people cannot but have a disastrous effect upon the community in which we live. It will be bad from a national point of view and from a commercial point of view, and I therefore feel certain that we should be wise in closely restricting the introduction of Asiatics into the Commonwealth of Australia.</para>

                            <para>With or without contract. I would go so far as to say that we should adopt a method which, though theoretically it might not, yet practically would, prohibit the introduction of these persons altogether. If it is desirable to restrict upon national grounds the importation of Chinamen and blackfellows, surely it is desirable to exclude them altogether. If we do not want many, because they do harm to the country, is it not desirable that we should keep out absolutely the elements that we believe to be a national degradation? Consequently, I say that, as far our power will allow us, the Commonwealth Parliament should prohibit the importation of black and yellow labour, and also put a stop to the conditions that exist, not only in the State of Queensland, but also in the State of Western Australia, where persons are imported for the express purpose of working the industries cheaper than they can be worked by white labour. I have no faith in the protestations of the sugar-grower, who tells us that he employs black men because the climate is too hot for white men. I have seen white men working under the same conditions, and I believe, from my experience and observation, that the reason the black man is employed in the north of Western Australia and in Queensland is that his labour is cheaper, and he gives more profit to the sugar-grower.</para>

                            <para>I do not know that the white man particularly desires any work if he can do without it, but still it is work that I have seen the white man do willingly and readily. I have seen them on the Tweed and in the southern parts of Queensland doing this work which they tell us is unfit for the white man to do. I am prepared to go the full length in this matter, and I hope the amendment will be carried, because I feel confident it is consistent with the welfare of the Commonwealth, and will not inflict any great hardship upon the sugar industry of Queensland. I t will do some harm to the sugar - grower, because it will take some of his profit. I t will put some of the profits into the pockets of the working people. The sugar industry is not maintained to enable the Sugar Refining Company or the sugar-grower to make large profits. The object of the industry is to create national prosperity, and the way to do that is to see that it is carried on under reasonable and healthy conditions. I was going to say a few words about the transcontinental railway, but another opportunity will offer. I believe the States of Western Australia and South Australia aie both going into the matter, and both of them will have the facts to place before the Federal Parliament. Therefore, I will say nothing more than that I believe the transcontinental railway will be found to be justifiable. I believe it will be a great benefit to the Commonwealth of Australia. I believe if there was any trouble in the shape of war, it would be the duty of the Commonwealth to protect Western Australia, and without the transcontinental railway that could not be done. Is the Commonwealth going to ignore the national duty which it has to perform in this direction ? Are we not going to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds for the purpose of protecting certain localities. Are we not going to maintain numerous forts in different places ? Then why should Western Australia be refused effective protection simply because it will cost a certain sum of money ? I f we can show when the proper time comes that the transcontinental railway from the eastern States to Western Australia will come within a reasonable degree of paying expenses, I think it will be the duty of Parliament to carry out the implied promise that was given to Western Australia by many of its politicians. I heard representatives of South Australia interject, when this • matter was being discussed, apparently in disapproval of the construction of the railway, but I would point out to them that South Australia, when urging the west to enter into this confederation and complete the union of Australia, held out the construction of this railway as an inducement. I t was held out by the leaders of the federal movement throughout Australia.</para>

                            <para>The leading federalists of the east went so far as to say that the railway would be constructed. If it was merely a play upon words, if it was merely an inducement and a bait to bring that colony into the confederation, I say it does not very much redound to the credit of the politicians of the eastern colonies. Senator Keating, in discussing the question of the Tariff, spoke rather disparagingly of free-traders who were now assenting to the imposition of duties, and he was apparently unable to see any distinction between a protectionist who imposed duties and .a free-trader. Is the protectionist not also kneeling down before the exigencies of the case; is he not in this very speech telling us that though this Government is a protectionist Government, yet we must first consider the finances of the Commonwealth ?</para>

                            <para>I call myself a freetrader, and yet I say that the financial conditions of the Commonwealth are such that I must consent to the imposition of duties. The difference between the two is that a, free-trader will only impose such duties as are rendered absolutely necessary, and the protectionist, on the other hand, imposes duties to prevent the collapse of existing industries. "Victoria, we have been told, has built up industries which, if subjected to the competition of the world, could not stand under a revenue Tariff. I say that that is a monument to the fallacy of protection. When a child arrives at the age of manhood and commercial strength it should be able to stand up and face the world. Surely the stage of childhood, has passed in "Victoria; surely the days have gone by when Victoria should consider herself commercially a child. She should be able now to compete ou fair terms with the nations of the world ? What is it that has brought about the conditions that we have seen aggravated in this State" beyond any other State? Surely it is that it has created the existing inflated conditions. "Victoria went in for borrowing, it created a condition which was not on a sound foundation, and which would not stand the pressure of commercial troubles. All the States suffered, but which State, may I put it, almost totally collapsed ? The State of Victoria.</para>

                            <para>She did not cease bolstering up industries instead of allowing the people to go into healthy avenues of labour. She did not cease to give bounties to industries which were going on in her sister colonies without them. She made it impossible for her to go into the markets of the world. She cried out for more territory in which to sell her goods, and therefore she seized on the straw of federation that saved her. What is the meaning of all this ? It means that protection in Victoria did what it does everywhere else. It built up a condition which would not enable her industries to face the markets of the world. She could only sell in Victoria because she was not producing on a sound, healthy basis. New South Wales is producing on a basis that would enable her to face any market in the world within reasonable distance.</para>

                            <para>—Le t me state the position of Western  Australia. Admitting, for the sake of argument, that protection is necessary for Victoria, is it necessary for Western Australia 1 Now, some people will say—"I t is provincial to take this view of the question ; you should consider Australia's necessity as a whole." But the way to get at the aggregate political opinions of the community is for every senator to voice the views of the people he represents, and say what is best for the State from which he comes. Then we get to know something like what is best for the community as a whole. Western  Australian industries are— first coal, then minerals generally, timber, farming and pastoral pursuits, and gold. Can any honorable members suggest to me that any one of these industries would receive the slightest advantage from a policy of protection. We have the coal industry, and we will in future have intercolonial free-trade.</para>

                            <para>I am not urging that because it is done in New South Wales it is right. Some seem to think my suggestion is that that which comes from New South Wales, or is suggested by it, is everything that it ought to be. I make no such proposition. I say, rather, that our coal industry is thrown into competition with the eastern States, our only competitors. Our minerals require no protection. Our timber is an export trade almost entirely; our farming and pastoral industries are thrown into competition with our only competitors,' the eastern States, and our gold industry requires no protection. Therefore, I ask, is there any industry in Western  Australia which could possibly be benefited by the imposition of duties which would tend, some people say, to create a more prosperous condition in the eastern States.</para>

                            <para>I am afraid you do not follow me. I think these industries cannot be assisted by a system of protection, and in a few years we shall be face to face with intercolonial free-trade and protection against the outer world. Therefore, I say it becomes my duty, even though I thought protection necessary for Victoria, to vote for free-trade, because it is not necessary and not consistent with the interests of the State from which I come. That is not provincial, because if I were to fight for what is good for Victoria and ignore Western Australian interests, we could not possibly get the result of national opinion in that way. I think, therefore, it is, not as it appears at first sight provincial, for me to say, because it is inconsistent that we should have a system of protection for Western  Australia that would be sufficient to justify me in my contention that for the Commonwealth of Australia I should fight for that which, as nearly as possible, approaches a free-trade Tariff. The suggestions made by Senator Fraser were answered by Senator Millen. I was going to point out that the butter industry, by which Victoria has been saved</para>

                            <para>I would not be justified in taking up further time, but I would suggest there are various lessons we might learn from the post, and even the oldest legislator is not above taking a lesson from tho past. ' I , as one of the youngest, am quite prepared to do so. If we fight the errors of the past we will fight tho system which has brought about the condition in Victoria to which I have referred and the collapse from which Western Australia and the other colonies saved her to a large extent. Another lesson wo can learn from tho past is, that the soundness of the community depends absolutely upon its people and upon the intellectual, physical, and moral calibre of its citizens. If that is so, surely it is manifest that we ought strenuously to oppose all those elements which will tend to the in troduction in the Commonwealth of any class of individual or persons whose presence here will have a disastrous effect upon tho nation. We should also, I think, develop our resources and industries in the interests of the people, and we should, as far as possible, see that no pauper labour is introduced into this country. If it is it merely means that we give a few individuals larger profits and pauperize the community in proportion.</para>

                            <para>I do not think the planters require any compensation, and I do not think Senator McGregor seriously considers they will. I feel confident that the sugar industry .will exist long after the black man has disappeared from the canefield. I feel confident it will exist under conditions which, although they will give less to the individuals who are manufacturing sugar, will give the community more. Though I thought it would mean' ruin to the sugar industry, still I should vote for the abolition of the Asiatic and South Sea labour, and as I am of opinion that an industry can live and prosper under reasonable and fair conditions, I feel that there is absolutely no danger at all in supporting and voting for the amendment that has been moved by' Senator Millen.</para>

                    <para>On the motion for the adjournment, I would like to ask the leader of the Senate if he can make arrangements for members to obtain proof sheets of the debate at an early hour each morning. The custom has been followed in Queensland, and has been found very convenient.</para>

                    <para>I am afraid it will be impossible to have proof sheets of our debates ready for us in the morning in the conditions under which Hansard works. As a general rule, Hansard appears at the end of - the week; when that is done, it is thought that things are going on very well. In order to bring out a proof every morning, it would require an immensely increased staff and increased expense. Under existing conditions, I am afraid I cannot promise the honorable member what he asks.</para>
