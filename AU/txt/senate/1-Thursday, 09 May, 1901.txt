" That commission had been duly signed before the sad event which has plunged the whole empire into mourning, and the King, my dear father, fully sharing Her late Majesty's wishes, decided to give effect to them, although His Majesty stated, on the occasion of his opening his first Parliament, that a separation from his son at such a time could not be otherwise than deeply painful to him. " His Majesty- has been pleased to consent to this separation, moved by his sense of the loyalty and devotion which prompted the generous aid afforded by all the colonies in the South African war, both in its earlier and more recent, stages, and of the splendid bravery of the colonial troops. It is also His Majesty's wish to acknowledge the readiness with which the ships of the special Australasian Squadron were placed at his disposal for service in China, and the valuable assistance rendered there by the naval contingents of the several colonies. " His Majesty further desired in this way to testify to his heartfelt gratitude for the warm sympathy extended by every part of his dominions to himself and his family in the irreparable loss they have sustained by the death of his beloved mother. " His Majesty has watched with the deepest interest the social and material progress made by his people in Australia, and has seen with thankfulness and heartfelt satisfaction the completion of that political union of which this Parliament is the embodiment. " The King is satisfied that the wisdom and patriotism which have characterized the exercise of the wide powers of self government hitherto enjoyed by the colonies will continue to be displayed in the exercise of the still wider powers with which the united Commonwealth has been endowed. His Majesty feels assured that the enjoyment of these powers will, if possible, enhance that loyalty and devotion to his throne and empire of which the people of Australia have already given such signal proofs. " It is His Majesty's earnest prayer that this union so happily achieved may, under God's blessing, prove an instrument for still further promoting the welfare and advancement] of his subjects in Australia and for the strengthening and consolidation of his empire. " Gentlemen of the Senate and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives : " It affords me much pleasure to convey to you this message from His Majesty. I now, in his name and on his behalf, declare this Parliament open." </para>

          <para>- I would remind the Senate that the time has arrived for electing a President, and, as I understand that there is not likely to be a unanimous choice in the first instance, I think it would be well if we were to lay down at once a method of procedure by which in the end the will of the majority might prevail. As honorable members are aware, the House of Commons' practice would guide a body of this kind in the absence of express direction by ourselves. I think it will be evident that, in the event of there being more than two candidates, the putting of several motions successively would very likely result in the election of a President who would not' be the choice of the majority of the House. The experience, I think, of all of us who have had much to do with deliberative bodies is that, in these circumstances, there is only one way of ascertaining the choice of the majority, and that is by the system of what is called exhaustive ballot. I propose therefore that, inasmuch as under the circumstances which are likely to arise, it is necessary to have some other procedure than that of the House of Commons, the Senate should lay down for itself a form of procedure to be adopted during this election of President. I put my proposal in the form . of a motion, which I ask the consent of the Senate to submit without notice. It is as follows : - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>That if no more than two candidates are proposed, the House of Commons,' practice be adopted ; that if more than two candidates are proposed, the Senate proceed to ballot ; that all candidates except the two highest on the first ballot drop out ; that if on the first ballot any candidate has an absolute majority of the votes given, he shall be declared elected President ; but if no candidate has such absolute majority, a second ballot be then taken, and that the candidate then obtaining the highest number of votes be declared elected President. </para>

          <para>- In seconding the amendment I desire to say that the proposition appears to me to be an extraordinary one. The honorable gentleman who brought forward the motion seems to forget altogether that we are here in our representative capacity to appoint the first President of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, and that our constituents are just as much interested in how we vote upon this question as they are in how we vote on any other subject. For that reason, I decidedly object to any attempt to throw the veil of secrecy over the proceedings of the Senate. The motion appears to me to be entirely opposed to the traditions of Parliament. Why should there be secret voting? Do honorable members object to the public knowing for whom they vote? I think it is the right of the people who sent us here to have that information given to them. ' There is no need for me to prolong this discussion. My mind is made up ; and I am decidedly opposed to anything in the way of secrecy. </para>

            <para>- No advantage in what ? What does the honorable member mean by that remark? There is nothing clandestine about it, but it is a double system of voting. You are having open voting, in so for as the proposers and seconders are concerned, and you are having - what you do not have when you choose a committee by ballot - voting by ballot as to all others who support any particular candidate. I think we ought to look upon this as a precedent. If we are to do this now, then we must be prepared to do it for all time. Usually the choice is made 'at a meeting before the formal sitting of the legislative body, and then the members come prepared to support practically unanimously a particular choice. It is unfortunate that that was not done in this instance. There may have been difficulties in the way I admit, but I think it would have been well if some such arrangement had been possible in this particular instance, and nobody could have called it a caucus or anything of that kind, because we should have assembled informally as a Senate, and with the view of deciding this question right out of hand, and then come here for the purpose of recording our votes. I do not know whether there is any precedent for anything of this kind. We are establishing one. I think it will be an unfortunate one, and that it would be . very much better for us to adhere to the system of open voting which has always prevailed than to adopt a compound system which has no precedent to justify it. </para>
