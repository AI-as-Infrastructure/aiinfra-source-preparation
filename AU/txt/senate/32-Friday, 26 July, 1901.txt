                        <para>- We have heard a great deal about Thursday Island, and Western Australian senators are anxious to show the weakness of, Fremantle. But we have heard from, I -think, Major-General Edwards - who was engaged to report on the position of . Australia from a strategic point of view - that Tasmania is one of the most vulnerable and easily assailable positions in the whole of the Australian States, and that if there should come about a war in which Great Britain was engaged, and Australia were in any way - assailed, possibly the harbors of Tasmania would be the theatres of a great deal of naval fighting. The communication we have had between Tasmania and the mainland in the past has not been altogether satisfactory. I do not wish to enter into details, because they are only wearisome. I will merely generalize by saying 'that for many years the communication was practically restricted to one particular company. Some ten years ago the people of Tasmania hailed with delight the advent of another company, which was going to break up the monopoly. To a great extent the monopoly was broken, and for some years we had rival steam-ship companies plying between Tasmania and the mainland, and vying with one another in the - endeavour to provide cheaper and quicker communication. After some few years had elapsed, however, we found that even those two companies felt it desirable, in their own interests, to combine, and then, to all intents and purposes, while they displayed the outward semblance of competition, there was a monopoly as before. The present communication is not so rapid as it might be. It is not, perhaps, bo cheap as it might be,, and the facilities and comforts extended to those who avail themselves of the communication are not so great as people would desire. So far as the question of defence is concerned, we know as an absolute fact that in Australian waters there are plying boats belonging to foreign nations. These boats are coming here primarily with the object of entering into competition with steam-ships which belong to British companies, and which are plying for trade in Australian waters. We further know that these foreign boats actually carry as ballast, and always ready for the slightest emergency, arms and ammunition, which enable them to be converted at the shortest possible notice into cruisers or armed merchantmen, should the nations to which they belong require their assistance at any particular time. \[ should like to see existing between Tasmania and the mainland a fast line of steam-ships which would be capable, in cases of emergency, of being converted into cruisers or armed merchantmen to assist in the protection of the coasts, if such protection from hostile invasion were ever necessary. As far as our postal communication is concerned it has not been altogether satisfactory in the past. As I jointed out on a previous occasion, we stand amongst the States as the most remote from the old world centres. We are the last to receive our communications from the old world, and upon us devolves the necessity of first despatching our replies. When we consider this, we must consider it desirable that the communication between these States - which must necessarily be for all time the centre of the political activity in the union - and Tasmania should be as rapid and efficient as possible. This should be so, .not only in the interests of the Postal department, but in the interests of_ those who are endeavouring to secure the advantages of the amalgamation of the various Postal departments of the States. The railways of the various States have not yet been taken over by the Commonwealth, but it is quite conceivable that they may be at no very distant date, and I would point out the disadvantage which would attach to Tasmania unless the connecting link between the mainland and that State were owned, or, to a great extent, controlled by the Government. What would be the advantage to Tasmania if the Commonwealth acquired the railways of that State, and also the control or ownership of the railways of the mainland States if there were no connecting link between the two systems of railways. There would be nothing that would enable the people of Tasmania to participate as fully as I claim they are entitled to participate in any amalgamation of railway control, because we should have as a connecting link between the two railway systems a line of communication that would be in the hands of what I may call a foreign power - not foreign in the sense of being a power outside our own union, but foreign to the Commonwealth Government itself. I claim as part of the benefits that we are entitled to participate in, that the perfecting of the means of communication between the mainland States' and Tasmania should be taken in hand by the Commonwealth Government. Now, unless a .motion of this character is carried, and effect is given to it, and the Commonwealth Government either acquires the absolute ownership of a line of communication between the mainland and Tasmania, or exercises an effective control over the existing line of communication, I have no hesitation in saying that the State I represent can never hope to participate to the extent that each State should participate in the practical benefits that we all consider should accrue from the union. Further, I maintain that the duty of placing us in the position which I claim we should occupy devolves upon the Commonwealth Government. For some years past the people of Tasmania have been alive to the fact that the communication with the mainland States has not been so good as it should be, and that by reason of that fact they have suffered to a great extent. The Government of Tasmania have been approached several times during the last few years to take up the matter, and I know that they have been inclined to give serious consideration to it. They were, as a matter of fact, approached on the subject no longer ago than eight or nine months. If the people of Tasmania have suffered from the lack of communication referred to, I have no hesitation in saying that the people of Australia have also suffered to a great extent from the same cause. I have been in the State of Victoria and also in New South Wales frequently, and I have met numbers of professional, commercial, and other people, very few of whom have not, at some time oi' other, been in Tasmania, but I regret to say that I have found a lesser percentage than ordinary of people who have visited Tasmania among the members of the Federal Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am not putting this motion on the same ground at all. I do not for a moment say that a pledge has been given to Tasmania, but Ave all hoped that with the establishment of federal union would come closer communication for commercial, 'postal, and defence purposes, and for the proper amalgamation of the railway systems of the various States, and I think we were justly entitled under the circumstances to expect it. All I ask under this motion is, not that the Commonwealth Government shall be committed to any particular scheme, or that it shall take over the control of any existing line of steam-ships, or establish a line of steamers to compete with the existing service, but that a Royal commission shall make full inquiry into the whole of the circumstances, and present a report to Parliament as to the advisability or otherwise of doing something in the direction indicated, the best method, and the probable cost. We have heard that in regard to the transcontinental railway inquiries are being made by some constituted authority. </para>

At any rate, inquiries are being made, and I presume that the Federal Parliament, whether it has appointed this authority to investigate or not, will pay due regard to the result of their inquiries before any action is taken. All I ask is that we should be placed in the same position, so far as the requirements of Tasmania are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- If it were necessary to transport troops to Tasmania, there would be plenty of ships available for the purpose, and no advantage could be gained by having a daily or weekly or tri-weekly service of armed cruisers running between here and that State. The advantage sought to be gained by enlisting the services of ships suitable for use as cruisers in case of war is that they may be a protection against a chance cruiser, and perhaps be able to prey upon the enemy's commerce at places on the ocean a week or two from any particular base. There would be no object in having an' armed passenger ship running between here and Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- I know that on one occasion in Queensland two Royal commissions were appointed at about the same time, and they consisted exclusively of Members of Parliament, who were paid fees and all expenses. I do not wish to lay down a hard and fast rule that Royal commissions ought never to be appointed, but the practice of appointing Royal commissions to get information which can be got as well without the appointment of a Royal commission is a practice that is to be deprecated. While I sympathize with the senators from Tasmania in their desire to remove what they think is an impediment to commerce, and to bring us closer together, I cannot see any necessity whatever for the appointment of a Royal commission, and I think it would be entirely inadvisable. I must therefore oppose the motion. </para>

                    <para>- I most heartily sympathize with the spirit of this motion. Federation is not accomplished in its true sense unless we have community of feeling amongst all the members of the Federation, and unless the federal sentiment is in the hearts of the people. I think there is nothing which destroys the federal sentiment so much as isolation. Though Tasmania is one of the smallest and least populous States of the Union, it is just as much entitled to consideration as any of the other States, and should have extended to it the rights and privileges extended to the greatest and most populous States in the Union. </para>

                        <para>- They cater to a great extent for the aspirations pf the people, and in Tasmania, with the exception of one or two issues which have been brought under the notice of this Parliament, the papers show that there is not very much interest taken by the people there in the doings of the Federal Parliament. I think that also applies to Western Australia, and the only reason that I can assign for it is the isolation we at present labour under. It is the duty of every member of th Federal Parliament to see that the best communication possible is provided between the various States. In Canada one of the first things done was to build a railway, for a distance, I think, of about 3,000 miles, from one side of Canada to the other - -from Quebec to Vancouver- rio order to facilitate communication and trade, and to provide a better system of defence, as well as to diffuse more federal feeling throughout the whole of that great Dominion. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, private enterprise has made the old country what it is now, the leading carrier of the world, and private enter-, prise has made the States of Australia what they are now - the pride of the Empire. I am a firm believer in private enterprise, and no believer in propping up industries or anything else unnaturally. I take it that the most important matter after all is the question, of defence. This is a matter with which I have had something to do, and I may, therefore, offer a few remarks upon it. I say at once that Tasmania has always been looked upon as the danger spot of Australia. Any enemy obtaining the Derwent, or to a lesser extent tie Tamar, as a base, would be placed in a very powerful position for a serious attack upon the mainland. </para>

                        <para>- I was told that at Georgetown the depth was not sufficient. The information I have upon the subject I obtained when I was Minister for Defence in Victoria, when General Edwards visited Australia. I know that was the opinion of the commission which then sat, and which had upon it an officer of the Royal Navy, sent out specially to deal with the matter. Whether the Derwent or the Tamar would be the more dangerous spot for an enemy to occupy - and the Tamar is a shorter distance from the mainland - they are both danger spots. That brings me to another point. I 'do not think that Tasmania, notwithstanding her comparatively small population, and her comparative small income, for a number of years past has done her fair share in connexion with defence. It is no secret that the defences of Tasmania have not been in a satisfactory condition for a long time. We must bear in mind that at the time when the Federal Council arrived at the. decision to fortify, at the cost of the colonies, Albany, Thursday Island, and to a lesser extent, Port Darwin, as being danger spots - Open doors that should be defended in the interests of Australia as a. whole - Tasmania refused to pay the paltry sum of a few hundred pounds, which wa3 her share of the expenditure, unless the other States stepped in and paid their proportion towards defending the Derwent and the Tamar. </para>

                <para>Senator Sir FREDERICK SARGOOD.The honorable and learned senator and I have had this matter out before in the Council of Defence at Hobart, so we both know all about it. The defences of Thursday Island and Albany were then three-parts finished. Defence works must begin somewhere. But I am sorry to say Tasmania absolutely refused to pay, and I do not know that up to the present day she has paid, the £780 which was her proportion of the charge for the defence of Thursday Island and Albany. Tasmania then claimed that nothing should be asked from her until the defence of the Derwent was finished. We all agree that some steps are necessary to be taken, and I wish ' to point out that it is not so difficult a matter to obtain vessels for defence as the honorable and learned member who proposed the motion seems to think. I may tell the Senate what I did when I was Minister of Defence in Victoria. Recognising the danger of an attack being made on Tasmania - because at that time there were complications, and .it looked very much as though Great Britain would be involved in war with Russia - I entered into.au arrangement with the Union Steam-ship Company in regard to six of their largest boats trading to New Zealand. I also telegraphed home and obtained six 6-in. breech-loading guns, mounted on naval carriages, with 200 rounds per gun. The guns were stored at Williamstown ready to be mounted on any one of those vessels. I 'made arrangements whereby at a few hours' notice the vessels could go under the crane, and have the guns placed on their decks ready for use. I also arranged with a naval drill instructor to accompany the vessels on the trip to Sydney and back, in order to train the men in gunnery. All this was done at the cost of a few thousand pounds, taking the guns into account. The ships had to be stiffened in order to stand the concussion of the guns, and that cost, I think, about £700 per vessel. I carried out exactly the same thing in the waters of Victoria, with regard to the dredgers and steam-tugs belonging to the Harbor Trust. Each of them was stiffened at a cost of £500 to carry a gun, and they are quite ready to do So to-day. I only mention these matters in order to show that there is no need for large expenditure. Guns can be kept in Hobart or Melbourne or any other place that is convenient, ready at a few hours' notice in the event .or chance of war. If, in the meantime, you take the trouble to drill the men on the vessels you have a perfect defence at a few hours' notice, and at quite a very small cost. I do not think there is any necessity to do more, and I should imagine that there would be no difficulty whatever in the Federal Minister for Defence, without any committee or Act of Parliament, making such arrangements, as part and parcel of the defences of the Commonwealth, with the Union or some other steam-ship company having sufficiently large boats. I need hardly say that since 188't the class of boats has very much improved. The honorable and learned senator wishes to obtain quickness of transit and improvement of the vessels, but the most important matter is the question of defence, not only in the interests of Tasmania, but in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                        <para>- Tasmania, of course, never can be connected by railway with the mainland. It appears to me that a general scheme will have to be thought of, and though what will be the limits and direction of such a scheme is, 1 must admit, a very important matter, it is included within the scope of' the motion. I hardly think we ought to go to' the expense of a Royal commission, not because I have quite so bad an opinion of Royal commissions as one honorable senator has, but because I think the inquiry desired, might very easily be made by a select committee. I hope the mover of the motion will consent to an amendment to that effect. </para>

                        <para>- If, in the interests of that wilderness of sand, it is desired to spend £5,000,000 for a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States - if our friends in South Australia desire that the Northern Territory should be taken over, and the Commonwealth thereby landed in a permanent deficit of about £81,000 per year - if in time to come 'we are going to alter the railway gauges, and have a uniform gauge for the purposes of defence at a cost of £1,500,000 - then do honorable senators not think Tasmania ought also to have some consideration ? This will all be part of a general scheme,- which will have to be considered in regard to the facilities each State has for obtaining the advantages of the federal union. As the carrying of the motion will benefit Tasmania very greatly, I quite admit that it is an important point to consider what portion of the extra expense the State affected ought to pay. It may be that it would be quite fair for Tasmania to extend her railway from Launceston down to Georgetown, a distance of 40 miles. That is a railway which would not pay at first, but it certainly would pay if worked in connexion with the running of large steamers. If the Government of Tasmania extend the railway to Georgetown, and build at the latter place a jetty, where, we are told, there is ample deep water, large oceangoing steamers could go alongside the jetty ; and I do not hesitate to say that a steamer could take passengers away from Australia after dinner, and land them in Launceston in time for breakfast. Part of the cost of this work might be borne by the Commonwealth . and another part by the State. I submit the amendment in the hope that the Senate will consent to the appointment of a select committee. </para>

                <para>SenatorMACFARLANE (Tasmania).My feeling is that a Royal commission is hardly necessary, and that a select committee would secure all we desire. It is undoubted that communication with Tasmania might be improved, but I should be very sorry to think that the improvement would be brought about by State-owned steam-ships, or anything approaching such a scheme. I shall be very glad, indeed, if anything can be done to promote better communication with Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and gunboats of a useful character. I therefore think that as a means of giving Parliament some information on the subject, this committee would be- a good thing. The committee will make inquiries as to the best means of carrying out these proposals. It has been said that Western Australia should not have taken upon itself the making of inquiry as to the advisableness of constructing the transcontinental railway. I admit that it would, perhaps, have been better left to th Commonwealth Government. So far as that inquiry has gone, however, the reports to hand justify the statements which have been made here, that the investigations will show that there is territory in Western- Australia-' which is going to- be valuable to the Commonwealth- in- the future. The inquiry now asked -for may remove the cobwebs that exist in the minds- of some honorable senators as to the usefulness of Tasmania as a component part of the Commonwealth. The Western Australian inquiry has shown that land in: the interior of the continent is not the waterless tract of country it was supposed to be. Subterranean lakes have been found- at Eyre, the' waters of which will be available and will be - used in the future- to transform the- country there. These lakes lie almost in' the track of the transcontinental line. I think the Senate will do well to- allow the inquiry asked for, as it may tend to bring, to light useful information- in regard to the defences of the Commonwealth, and lead to an increase of trade. </para>

                        <para>- The sailing vessels which have carried the commerce of the world for thousands of years, have done excellent service. They are disappearing, however, gradually, but very surely, before the advance of the steam-ship, and so it is with every department of commerce and science. The old is giving place to the new. Private enterprise is giving away in many lines to public enterprise. After all, public enterprise is merely the extension of the joint stock company principle. We very rarely meet an individual capitalist now-a-days. We have combines, joint stock companies perhaps, with their hundreds of shareholders. Then we have' combines of a number of joint stock companies joining hands and forming one great trust. This is only an extension of that idea. All the people of the Commonwealth join in a combine and carry on business on their own account. This is the reason why I think it could be achieved much more advantageously in this fashion, and that is why I say that if the Commonwealth is going to help Tasmania by establishing State-owned and controlled lines of steam-ships between the two portions of the Commonwealth- </para>

                        <para>- There is the traffic which exists at the present moment. I would like the honorable senator to consider that with the more liberal policy which I hope the Tasmanian Government will adopt there will be an increase of population, there will be an increase of production, and, with cheap fares between the mainland and Tasmania, there will be a rush of tourists every year. No doubt honorable senators from Tasmania look upon the prospect which I am endeavouring to paint with great pleasure, but I hope that other people besides themselves will benefit by its realization. No doubt they look upon it from the point of view that it will increase the trade of Tasmania, that it will raise land values, and all that sort of thing. </para>

                        <para>- That is all I desire to do. That is all that is seemly, and while I am addressing you, sir, you should be allowed to hear what I am saying, if you think it worth hearing. I submit that we have a standing order, which specifically sets out a certain course of action. When there are orders of the day on the paper, the standing orders under which we are acting do not permit an interference with those orders of the day, in the interests of motions earlier upon the paper. If it is competent for any honorable senator to suspend the operation of this standing order, when on earth are the orders of the day to be reached? The orders of the day can never be reached if this standing order is to be wafted out of existence at the pleasure of any honorable senator who desires to get on with a motion which he may have put upon the notice-paper weeks and months after the House has deliberately set down certain business for transaction as an order of the day. There must be some time for dealing with orders of the day, and if I or any other honorable senator can come along and load the paper with notices of motion in . advance of the orders of the day, those orders of the day can . never be reached. If a motion is made to suspend the standing orders to admit of the continuation of discussion upon motions to the exclusion of orders of the day, I for one shall object. I think that this rule, which, I take it, is a most inconvenient one- </para>

                    (Tasmania), in reply. -I shall not occupy the Senate any time in replying, but having accepted the motion in its amended form, I wish simply to indicate to the Senate that my desire in bringing forward this motion was that a proper system of inquiry should be adopted, and that the whole of the facts should- be ascertained, and placed before the Senate in a proper form. I entirely 'disagree with the suggestion which came from the Postmaster-General, that the necessary inquiry could have been made by a private individual. I wish also to distinctly repudiate the attitude that has been attributed to me so warmly by
                    I deny most distinctly that any conduct of mine since I have been a senator can be properly construed into an attitude of distrust of the potentialities of my own State. I regard this not purely as a State matter, and not of slight significance and importance. I think I am doing the proper thing in bringing before this branch of the Legislature a question of the importance which this matter is to the whole of the Commonwealth. I am not bringing it forward merely in the interests of my own State, because I think that it is in the interests of the whole of the States that have come into the union that consideration should be given to the means of communication between Australia and what
                    has so . aptly described as the ocean State of the Union. Tasmania is the one State which, though not perhaps so remote from the governing centre of the Commonwealth as other States, is separated from the others by that insuperable barrier - from a railway point of view - the ocean. I have listened with a great deal of pleasure to the sympathy expressed by honorable senators with the terms of the motion in its ' amended form, and I am pleased to know -that that sympathy will take a practical shape.

                        <para>- I contend that the words " other than State insurance " do not leave to the Commonwealth an original power of providing for insurance as a Commonwealth ; that the section says that the Commonwealth shall have no power to deal with . insurance at all that answers to the generic description of " State or national insurance." What is excluded is any class of insurance hereto-, fore carried on as State insurance. If that is the meaning, it. occurs to me from a consideration of what were the views of the framers of the Constitution- </para>

                        <para>- Clearly. We have the framers of the Constitution coming together and saying-" We are going to establish a central Government. We are going to give it jurisdiction in all external affairs, in all intercolonial affairs, and in all matters which are of mutual concern." They gave it jurisdiction in regard to' matters such as marriage and divorce laws in which uniformity is desirable. Then they said, " We will also give it jurisdiction over banking and insurance." It occurs to me that they thought it was desirable that there should be some Government control over systems of insurance, and also over systems of banking. They found that the private institutions had their ramifications throughout the States, having branches in the different States. They, therefore, said - " We cannot leave the government of insurance and banking generally in the power of the States." Why? Because by so doing either of two objections would arise ; either the State law would have to become operative outside of its own boundaries where there is a branch in another State, which would be unfederal ; or the State law would have to . apply to a branch of an institution that had its principal . office in one of the other States, which would also be unfederal. Therefore, they said that - "Any class of insurance or banking that has this objectionable feature we will take under our control." And then we can suppose some member of the Convention getting up and saying - " There are classes of insurance that . do not contain the objectionable feature of having brandies outside the boundary of the State." Those are State insurances, and State only. The Convention, I take it, saw that . at once, and said - "Very good, we do not want to meddle in these matters at all, except where it is necessary to do so to prevent one -State making -laws binding upon another. Therefore the class of insurance entirely confined within the boundaries of the State we exclude." That is borne out by the section - </para>

                        <para>- No. The meaning of the section is this- Show me any system of insurance that involves two or more States, and whether that system answers to the description of national or private insurance, we assume control of it. The first part of the sub-section says we are to have control of all insurance other than that carried on by a State. Why ? Because when it is carried on by the States' Governments it does not go outside the boundaries of 'the -States. But if it is carried on by the States, and goes beyond the boundaries of the State, the latter part of the sub-section comes in and gives the jurisdiction to us. </para>

                        <para>- Precisely, that is it. The intention of the framers of the Act was not to confer on the Commonwealth original , jurisdiction to create Commonwealth banking or Commonwealth insurance, but the intention was to differentiate in the control of the existing systems throughout the States. It was to mark the limits of this control,, not to confer on the Commonwealth original jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>- I will put it another way. Before federation there were in some of the colonies two systems of insurance and two systems of banking carried on, or it is conceivable that there may have been - namely, the system that would spring entirely from the Government and be under Government control, and the system of private institutions that were under the ordinary laws of the States. Now, we are going into federation, and the first thing that occurs to the framers of the Constitution is, that it is unfederal to have one State making laws in reference to banking or insurances that are to be operative outside its own boundary, and they therefore say " We will give that jurisdiction, that controlling jurisdiction, in such cases to the Federal Government." Then it occurred to the framers that it was not necessary to transfer this controlling jurisdiction to the Federal ' Government, where the operations of the banking or insurance system did not go outside the boundaries of a particular State, and they said - "We will exclude banking or insurance carried on by a State Government itself, because where it is carried on by the Government itself, it has no branch outside the State." </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. We have control (a) over all private banks and insurance companies throughout Australia. Why? Because their ramifications may extend outside of any State, and we must have uniformity. (b) Over another system of banking or insurance, that carried on by the State, if it involves two or more States, under the qualification of the latter part of the section. It appears, then, to stand out quite clearly that what was intended by the section was not the conferring of original jurisdiction upon the Commonwealth, but the differentiating of the control that it should take. That this is so I think is very obvious, whatever may be the strict grammatical construction of the section, and it is certainly not in accordance with the intention of the Constitution that we should set up a system of banking or insurance ourselves. </para>

                        <para>-I am quite with the honorable senator as to the difficulty. I found upon looking through the debates, as I have done since we last discussed the question, that every one of the speakers directed his arguments, not at all to the advisability of having Commonwealth insurance or banking, but to the question of how much control the Commonwealth  should take over existing systems. I think that is clearly what was intended by the Convention, and is to be seen in the reading of the words used in the section to give effect to it. Because, if we are going to say that the words "other than State insurance" have some other meaning, we ought to be able to substitute the word " colony" for the word "State"; and the section would then read "insurance other than colony insurance," which would be meaningless. Suppose an honorable senator took up a book by Herbert Spencer on "Sociology," or an Act of Parliament, and saw in it a reference to insurance "other than State insurance," would he have the slightest hesitation in coming to the conclusion that "State," as used there, has the ordinary dictionary meaning, and referred to the character or quality of the insurance ? </para>

                        <para>- Now, the question is, will the honorable and learned senator give the word a different meaning because he finds it used in this Act ? I am quite aware that many difficulties may arise in connoting the word " State" as "colony"; but connoting the word as I do, notwithstanding the difficulty of construction, I think it will be seen that the balance of probability is in favour of the view I have taken of what was in the mind of the framers at the time, though there is ambiguity of expression in the use of the words " insurance other than State insurance." My connotation of " State " is " national " as opposed to " individual." </para>

                        <para>- More work that the employé is paid for. I am sure. that the party which my honorable friend and his able colleagues in this Senate so- well represented do not wish for recompense without a return. What they want is work, and they are willing to work if they are paid for it. Therefore, they have to take their share in supplying all that is necessary to keep that state of things- moving by which they live and thrive. In my opinion we should have some system whereby all the interested parties would participate in the burthen that necessarily falls upon some one by reason of these accidents. Therefore, I think there can be little doubt as to the truth of the propositions I have put. Then the question arises - how are we to give effect to this abstract motion ? The first thing that occurs to any one is this - in proportion as you diminish the anxiety of the employer by such an insurance fund, in proportion as you give greater assurance to the employe of being compensated whatever occurs, you lessen the vigilance of the one and the carefulness of the other. </para>
