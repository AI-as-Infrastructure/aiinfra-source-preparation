The time of Ministers is so much occupied in the House that we have been obliged to arrange for a meeting of the Cabinet and Executive this morning, at which my attendance will be necessary, and, therefore, it will be impossible for both Ministers to be here. It was thus impracticable to fix the Customs Bill for to-day, or otherwise I should have asked the House to go on with it. I am glad to know from the expression of opinion that has just taken place that we shall have no difficulty in doing what is proposed. </para>

                        <para>- (New South Wales - Vice-President of the Executive Council.) - The Government are in favour of the principle of this measure, and I am glad to hear that the honorable senator does not propose to go further than the second reading stage to-day, because, while we are in favour of the principle, there are very many grave considerations as to the method in which it is to be carried out, and as to the necessity of adapting the law to the new conditions in which we find ourselves. The honorable senator's Bill is almost a verbatim copy of the New South Wales Act, which has worked very well. Whether or not it is applicable to our new conditions - whether or not, for' instance, the method of summoning witnesses, the power to examine witnesses, and other matters, . are such as we desire - will have to be carefully considered in committee ; and I do not bind myself or the Government in any way, in assenting to the principle, to assent -to the method in which it is proposed to carry out these provisions. The honorable senator has made some reference to the standing orders, and I think it is well that we should be perfectly clear that nothing has been done in the Senate or in Parliament which has in any way abridged the rights we have under the Constitution. Section 49 of the Constitution says that - </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The powers and privileges and immunities of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, and of the members of the committee of each House shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared by the Parliament shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees at the establishment of the Commonwealth. </para>
                        <para>The phrase " shall be declared by the Parliament," I take it, refers to declaration by statute. There cannot be any other way in which Parliament will declare except by statute. Therefore, until Parliament passes a law defining our 'powers and privileges they must be the same as those of the House of Commons at the time of the passing of .the Constitution Act. In regard to the examining of witnesses there is a statute in force authorizing the examination of witnesses before committees of the House of Commons, so that we at the present time 'are- not without powers in that respect: We have all the machinery of the House of Commons if we choose to adapt it to our procedure. At the same time, it is quite necessary and right that we should define our own powers in a way specially suited to our own local purposes. Having referred to the section of the Constitution Act I should also like to refer to the standing order which I think the honorable senator had in his mind, namely, No. 418. It can in no way whatever detract from the privileges which we have under the Constitution, nor. can it override a statute. -. It does not .purport to take away even our right to examine witnesses. Standing Order 418 says - </para>

                    <para>- This is a motion which I think would commend itself generally to honorable senators if it were not for the use of the word "forthwith." The proposal that the Government should purchase the cable forthwith seems to me very objectionable indeed, as it would prevent our exercising that economy in the purchase which ought to be exercised. It has been pointed out that this cable has . been laid down for some years, and is likely to have deteriorated very much. By. the terms of the contracts, under what the company is working the cable it appears that they would expect the whole of their expenditure to be repaid to them. That in itself is objectionable in the case of a cable which has been laid down for so many years. I venture, therefore, to suggest an amendment upon this motion which will meet the case as it presents itself to my mind. My object, in the first instance, is that the existing cable, if acquired, shall be acquired only upon reasonable terms, and with respect to the first provision in my proposed amendment, there is an alternative suggested if we cannot acquire the existing cable on reasonable terms. Prom the copies of the contract which have been circulated to honorable senators, it is by no means clear that the Commonwealth cannot lay down a cable of its own. The provision of the contract affecting the matter, reads in this way - </para>

                        <para>- Of course, the honorable senator may do that. Although it may appear somewhat extraordinary to senators who have been used to a different course of procedure, it might seem just as extraordinary to other senators to have to adopt a procedure different to this. These standing orders, as every one knows, have been adopted hurriedly, and we all know "that it is the wish of the Senate that in agreeing to permanent standing orders some of the provisions of these should be altered, but so long as they exist it is my duty to administer them. </para>

New Guinea might become a part of the Commonwealth, and in that case I take it the principle which the Senate might affirm to-day, would be applicable. What I desire is that the motion should be amended in such a way as to simply affirm the principle of the desirability of the ownership and control of the telegraphic communication between Tasmania and the mainland being in the hands of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know that it is quite the same, but it is from my experience in connexion with that matter that I am now speaking. In that case, the State became purchasers of the line at a great disadvantage, under public pressure, and in the end paid £1,119,000 for the line which cost only £700,000. I have no wish to oppose the motion, but my idea would be, after having ventilated the subject, not to think of purchasing the cable, unless the company come to the Commonwealth, and offer to sell at a reasonable price. If the cable is new, it is worth purchasing at its market value, but the agreement has now only eight years to run, and, no doubt, at the end of that time the cable may be acquired by the Commonwealth upon fair terms. </para>

                    <para>- I. should have been very well satisfied to get half the interest which they got. They got a .very good result. They put out the profits they were making at compound interest, and were drawing the profits from the Government of Tasmania in the meantime. Of course the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company may have learned wisdom from the operations of that railway company. I knew that there was one cable laid in addition to the original cable, but it appears now from this document, that a cable was laid in 1900 - and this is certainly information to me- in place of the one laid in 1885, so that, instead of the cables, being old, both are new. </para>

                    <para>In reply to your letter of the 9th inst., I have the honour to refer to the following statements made by the honorable members of the Senate relative to the Tasmanian cable, which I consider were, to some extent, misleading : - </para>
                    <para>Referring to the first statement, I beg to point out that cost of working, maintenance, and contribution to amortization fund has to be deducted from the income. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators will remember that in speaking on this subject I specially pointed out that the £9,800 per annum was income and not net profit. The second alleged misstatement was the Postmaster-General's, and I have already referred to that. Then - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>To the second statement, honorable senators evidently were not aware that in 1885 the company laid a second cable without additional subsidy, and that in 1898 a new cable was laid in place of the one laid in 1869; and in 1900 (last year) a new cable was laid in place of the one laid in 1885, so that instead of the cables being old both are new. </para>
                    <para>To the third statement, I have to point out that', in accordance with article 5 of the 1889 agreement, the Tasmanian Government exercised the right of control of tariff by fixing the present rates, viz., for ordinary1s. for twenty words (inclusive of address and signature), or three fifths of a penny per word ; press messages, 2s. for the first 100 and1s. for each additional 50 words, or six-twenty-fifths of a penny per word.. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I think you must admit that this isa very low tariff for 180 miles of cable, also that the full rate - 2s. for twenty words - from any part of Tasmania to any part of Victoria, compares most favorably with any other cable tariff in the world. </para>
                <para>For an example, take the rate charged between England and France - twopence per word - and the length of cable only about twentymiles. </para>

                        <para>- I know the question of old-age pensions was dealt with by many persons in a furtive kind of way, but do not know that it was ever made until then, and certainly not in New South Wales, a decisive question upon which to challenge the support of the public for a return to Parliament. Subsequently, empowered by the Government of New South Wales by commission under the Great Seal, I visited England and the Continent of Europe to obtain the latest information available, and I compiled a report, which will be found in the Library of the Parliament, showing the steps that had been taken by every continental Government, either in the form of legislation actually accomplished, or of legislative proposals submitted for the consideration of the different Parliaments, and every scheme that had been devised by the wisdom or unwisdom of the leaders of Continental Europe. I do not purpose at this stage to occupy time in going through what has been done on the Continent of Europe. It is sufficient to repeat the fact, which I suppose is known to every member of the Senate, that there is the strongest possible movement amongst the civilized peoples of the world in favour of measures providing for the old aged by a more enlightened and humanitarian system than that of work-houses, poor-houses, or asylums. There is also a desire to do something more definite than the mere distribution of outdoor relief. I may remark in passing, that though in the old country old-age pensions have not yet been established, the fact remains that the whole course of relief distribution in the old land is in the direction of outdoor relief rather than of indoor relief : that outdoor relief is supplanting, to a very remarkable extent, the indoor provisions of the work-houses. It may be said that it is not the duty of the State to deal with these matters, and that they should be left to private enterprise. That view of the question is so frequently put forward, that I venture to say a word or two upon it. There is a duty of the State towards its members. In Australia we have found a system growing up in all, or nearly all, the States of regarding the support of old people at the cost of the State, as a Government charity. In </para>

                <para>To see that none of its members starve, is as much the duty of the Government of the State, as it is the duty of the head of the family. This duty is recognised and acted upon in respect of helpless infancy, and it follows as a necessary corollary that it is equally the duty of the State to provide for the helplessness of old age and infirmity. </para>
                <para>Ito is, then, plainly apparent that the method of dealing with those members of the community who are, by infirmity or advanced years, no longer able to sustain themselves, is fundamentally wrong- </para>

                        <para>- I forget, the source from which I made the extract, but I think it was from an official document. It was not taken directly from Paine's Life and Works. There have been proposals, such as those of Charles Boothe, the well-known humanitarian, that every person upon reaching a certain age shall be the subject of an old-age pension. I do not think that the world has gone far enough to joyfully assent to the granting of old-age pensions to millionaires and people whose circumstances do not necessitate any outside assistance. However excellent it may be as a theoretical proposition, it is not within the range of practical politics, and I am not an advocate of that sort of thing. The age at which pensions should commence is of much less importance than is the question of necessity. Many a man at 65 -years of age is better able to earn a living than is another man at 55 years. </para>

                        <para>- There is something more than the matter of education involved. A child has to be clothed and supported until he or she can earn a living. That duty falls upon the parents. We have evidence in the discussions in the press and in official documents of on apparent falling off in the rate of the natural increase of population, and that is a very serious matter. It is more beneficial to the community that we should have large families with no old-age provision, than that we . should have small families with old-age pensions. A healthy and a growing population, able to develop the resources of the country, is of more value to the community as a whole than the fact that a certain number of persons have made provision for their old age at their own expense. Is it needful that I should advocate this view, seeing that the two great States of the Commonwealth and the colony of New Zealand have all taken steps in the direction of granting free pensions to the aged? The same thing applies, for instance, in Denmark, although the Danish system does not give so much an example of old-age pensions as an example of an elaborate system of out-door relief, as is abundantly shown in my report. Even apart from the theoretical question of 'contribution for old-age pensions, I have shown the difficulties that arise - that those who most need assistance in their old age are those who, in early life, are least able to make provision. There also is the question of the growth of these great funds. Take the case of Germany. A gigantic fund has accumulated there. At the time my report was written it had reached £75,000,000 after four years' operation. The other day the French Government put forward a scheme of old-age pensions, on a contributory basis I admit, and it is officially announced that the fund is to total £496,000,000, a sum approximating to the size of the British national debt. </para>

                        <para>- Because we want, I take it, as a Commonwealth, to do something more than assent to partial efforts. Why did we ever form a Commonwealth, would be a fair answer to the honorable senator's question why should we interfere with two States in their legislation. We have interfered with the legislation of every State for the sake of having one great system, instead of a number of detached efforts. We have sought to achieve uniformity in respect of matters of large public consequence, and the provision of old-age pensions is undoubtedly a question of large public consequence, and it is one of the subjects with which this Parliament is specially authorized to deal. It is too late now to talk of going back to State affairs in a matter of this kind. Much better would it be to amalgamate the two existing systems, and adding the rest of the Commonwealth to that system, make a homogeneous whole, instead of allowing the population of one portion of the Commonwealth to have advantages denied to the rest. While "Victoria has made this movement, while New South Wales has made a similar movement, the fact remains that, by reason of these movements being separate, a great number of persons in the community are debarred the right of getting an old-age pension, simply because they have not lived long enough in one of the two States. We want residence in the Commonwealth, and not residence in one portion of the </para>

                        <para>- On the last occasion when this Bill was before the Senate, I moved the adjournment of the debate, because it was not then desired to go into committee, and knowing that several honorable senators wished to address themselves to the question, I desired to give them an opportunity of doing so. This afternoon I propose to offer a few criticisms with respect to the measure. Let me say at the outset that, viewing the Bill as a whole, I think it is a very fair one, though there are departures in it which are unusual, and not known generally to persons who have not studied State measures of this character. For a considerable time past there has been a cry for reform of the public service, the methods we -have adopted in the States in the past not having given universal satisfaction, and the time has arrived for lis to consider whether, in view of the fact that we have a Commonwealth Public Service Bill before us, we may not wisely depart from those principles which have governed the State services, to the advantage of the Commonwealth. The Bill provides for one commissioner, instead of the three to -which I and other honorable senators have been accustomed. I do not desire to offer any serious objection to that provision, but there are some dangers in respect to it. It will work well - provided we get the right man. It seems to me that we are placing tremendous powers in the hands of the Public Sen-ice Commissioner. When I have viewed the duties of the commissioner and other officers under this Bill, I have asked myself - Where does the Minister come in in respect to these matters? It seems to me that there is no responsibility so far as the Minister is concerned. I think that is unwise, and that larger powers should be given to the Minister. When we come to consider the difficulties in connexion with the removal or suspension of the commissioner, we find that he is made an autocrat. Again, there is a provision for six inspectors. There has been a cry for economy all round, and it seems to me that, at the outset, these inspectors are' not necessary, and for the time being it-would be -better if inspectors were not appointed. </para>

                            <para>- It might be dangerous, but the Government in this matter are holding out hope to those persons in their employ of obtaining a. permanent footing in the public service. I am open to correction, but if I remember aright, when the Bill was before another place the attention of the Minister in charge of. it was directed to this particular matter, and lie said that these employes would be considered. I want to know in what way they are to be considered. If they are not to be considered in the way I propose, the result will be that they will have no permanent footing. Month after month, and year after year the Government will retain and will be desirous of retaining their services. I apprehend that unless their services were valuable they would not be retained, and I say that some chance should be given to employes of this character. Take, for instance, temporary line repairers in connexion with the Postmaster-General's department. There ave men who have been engaged in that position in the service for a considerable time, and they should receive some consideration. We must bear in mind that the rule applies to all departments of the public service. There is a certain amount of skill required, and these men being able to perform the work expeditiously, are better than men coming on new to the work put .before them. That is a matter to which I shall, draw attention in committee, if no honorable senator does so, in order to elicit the ideas of the Postmaster-General on the subject. I next desire to draw attention to two clauses upon which a large amount of discussion is likely to take place- - the clauses dealing with the clerical division and the provision made for the payment, of the minimum wage. With regard to sub-clause (3) of clause 21 dealing with the clerical division, I want to point out to the Postmaster-General what I consider to be an anomaly there, and also to show him that, under some circumstances at present existing, it will inflict hardship . upon a number of deserving officers. It says - </para>

                            <para>- lam speaking now with regard to appointments of persons where there may be transfers. I will give an illustration which will clearly show what I mean. For instance, a letter-carrier who receives £120 per annum qualifies and is appointed to the clerical division. He is then compelled to remain for four years without any increase of salary, whereas, if he had not qualified for appointment to the clerical division, he would be receiving annual increments until his maximum of £150 per annum was reached. He is thus penalized for trying to better himself and the service. </para>

                            <para>- We are told first that a woman has not got the same responsibility as a man, and secondly, that there is no need to legislate in this direction, because the majority of the women get married, and through that and other causes drop out of the public service. That is not the case in respect to a very large majority. Honorable senators, if they like to inquire, will find out that, for quite a number of years, women have been and will be employed, and while, perhaps, in one way I am prepared to admit that a woman has the same responsibility as a man, yet there are plenty of women in the public service and elsewhere who have as much responsibility as any married man with a family in the State. In the public service there are women who have to bring up brothers and sisters, who may have been orphaned at an early age. There are some of them who keep their families, others their fathers and mothers who are past work. The same rule applies all round, and that is a factor which I think should weigh in the argument. At the same time I am reminded by the interjection that we are not making comparisons in regard to the other sex. We are dealing with the relative value of services of men and women to the Commonwealth. I contend that there are women who are doing work as well as, if not better than, many male officers. </para>

These views I have held for a considerable period, and I am prepared to advocate them on this occasion. Besides the clauses dealing with life assurance, we have clauses dealing with leave of absence and holidays. I am glad that the Government have been generous in this respect. Undoubtedly the Government ought to be a model employer. This portion of the Bill meets with my warmest admiration, and I trust that it will be passed. </para>

                        <para>- I think this Bill is certainly the most important one we' have yet had to consider, and I wish to take the opportunity afforded at the second reading stage to offer a few remarks as to its general scope and object. In the Bill we consider the creation of the executive by which the various departments are to be administered. From that point of view, considering the number of public servants who will be employed, it is a measure of the greatest importance. The administration of the laws we enact is only second in importance to the laws themselves. The more social legislation we enact the more departments we shall absorb. The larger those departments become the more numerous will be the civil service. Therefore, a Civil Service Bill is not only one of very great importance, but one of increasing importance as the administration of the Commonwealth goes on. Another very important question on which it has. an immediate bearing is the cost of the administration of the departments. That matter, to my mind, should be very seriously considered by the Senate. There has been a great deal of criticism as to the extra expenses of the Commonwealth outside of the departments we administer. That is a mutter of very great importance, for it is a question of £300,000 or £400,000. What I consider is a matter of greater importance, and one which will involve larger figures, is the question whether the Commonwealth can administer the transferred departments as economically, or, as was stated before federation, more economically, than the various States did. The manner in which the public service is to be controlled has a very great bearing on the cost of- administration. The framers of this Bill have had the advantage of the experience and the experiments of not only the States in Australia, but of other countries. The objects of the Bill are good. The Government have made a very intelligent endeavour to create a Bill in which the chief principle is promotion by merit. And they have endeavoured to hedge that principle round in such a way as to decrease as much as possible the evils of political influence, if not the evils of social influence, which, I think, is even worse than political influence. The object of the framers of this Bill is to diffuse into the civil service, by statute, some of the energy and enterprise that are shown in private businesses. If it is difficult in the various States to administer the civil service on those lines - to endeavour .to promote by merit - it is very much more difficult for the Commonwealth Government to bring into effect a Bill which will deal equitably with tall sections of the civil service, in all places and in all climates, and to provide at the same time that the individual rights of each member of the service are properly conserved. The system of promotion by merit will certainly attract to the civil service people of intelligence and energy. The system of advancement by seniority which has been in force in Victoria certainly has not tended to attract such people. If we want the important departments of the Commonwealth to be properly administered, we must be prepared to pay good salaries, to see that the officers have their individual rights conserved, and that promotion is by merit, so that those who prove that they are fitted for higher positions will be able to attain to them. While the Government have carefully placed in the Bill safeguards against the exercise of political influence, and have conserved at the same time legislative control, I cannot see that they have made any effort to abolish social influence, which I consider to be as dangerous as, if not more dangerous than, political influence. I believe that for one promotion that will take place through political influence, twenty will take place through social influence. Approaches will be made by influential people, not to the Government, but to the heads of the departments, asking that their friends shall be pushed forward in the service. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but many people who have passed those examinations cannot get their promotions. The Bill has not adequately grappled with social influence ; and in some of the amendments which I have circulated, I have endeavoured to provide that there shall be an appeal court, so that officers who think that they are entitled .to promotion, and who have been passed over in favour of others, or officers who think they are entitled to be transferred from one place to another, shall be able to appeal to a properly constituted tribunal, which will take evidence and send it on to the commissioner, who will be able to decide whether or not the particular transfer or promotion should take place. In regard to the question of transfers, my experience in Western Australia has been that the civil servants have been treated very cruelly. They have, in many cases, been shifted, because they have attempted to form associations, to places like Eucla, where they are practically buried alive. They are moved to such outlying stations - </para>

                            <para>- It simply consists of the telegraph, offices, one store, and one hotel. "Where two or three are gathered together " - you will always find an hotel ; but that does not create a desirable centre of enjoyment for an intelligent human being. The object of the Bill is, as far as possible, to construct the civil service on the lines of an incorporated company. The Governor - General - which means practically the Executive - occupies the position of the board of directors : the commissioner is the general manager, and the seven permanent heads are the managers of the various departments of the company. The powers given to the commissioner are exceedingly large. He is the chief adviser of the Governor-General in Council, and with the exception of certain powers definitely given under clauses 21, 27, and 38, the Governor-General does nothing without a report from the commissioner. The commissioner recommends to the Governor-General the disposal, not only of offices, but of officers, and the transfer of officers from one department to another. He makes recommendations with regard to the retirement of officers. That is an. important proposal, because there is always a great danger in a public service of over-manning departments. I believe that when the bookkeeping period is ended, it will be found that many of the departments are over-manned, and will have to be reduced. It is provided in this Bill that if any department is over-manned, surplus officers must be transferred to other departments, but in the event of no other departments requiring extra assistance, the extra men are to be dismissed. With regard to salaries, the remuneration of the administrative division is to be fixed by the Appropriation Act : the salaries of the professional division are to be fixed by regulation - that is, by the Ministry : the salaries of the general division are likewise to be fixed by regulation j and the salaries of the clerical division are set out in schedule 3. So that really the only salaries we have to consider in this Bill ave those of the clerical division. There is one clause that ought to be carefully considered - namely, that which involves the question of a medical examination. I admit that this is a most difficult matter. It is one that I have thought over a good deal, yet I cannot frame any amendment with regard to it. The Bill states that every candidate for a position in the service must undergo a medical examination, in order to show that he is sound and of good health. This means that we shut out from the avenues of clerical employment all those who are physically weak, or unfit for physical employment. It is, no doubt, advisable from a utilitarian point of view to do that, but at the same time it seems to me to be exceedingly' cruel. Suppose private employers of labour did the same. </para>

                            <para>- Even supposing they are as good, that is a reason why they should be paid as well as men. All we ask is that this Bill shall establish the principle of payment according to merit, and that women shall be paid according to the value of services rendered. 1 know that women have been accustomed to be paid less than men, but that is not a fair, honorable, or democratic way of treating them. I am certain that the women themselves are quite agreeable to be paid in accordance with the value of their services. The general intention of this Bill is very good. . It has been considerably improved in its passage through another place, and I believe that it will be still further improved by the Senate. I believe that it will be an exceedingly good measure by the time it gets through all its stages in Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I do not see how it could stop promotion when these persons would necessarily be in the initial grade of the service, and their chance of promotion would only come when their seniors in the service had gone up higher. There is a little matter to which I would direct the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bill, because I propose to move an amendment in due course in reference to it, and that is the question of fines. I think the fines ought to go to the guarantee fund of the service. I do not think they should go into the consolidated revenue. The fines, which are a loss to the members of the service upon whom they have been imposed, should go to augment the guarantee fund, and to reduce the annual payments required from the members of the service generally. It is a detail, but one I think worthy of attention. Reference has been made to clause 50, dealing with appeals. I am strongly in favour of the appointment of a Court of Appeal, so that the appeal which is designated in the Bill may have some genuine value. There is another matter I would like the Postmaster-General to take a note of, because it has some special reference to his department, and that is with reference to the charging of rent to post and telegraph masters. I understand that no rent is charged to such persons in respect of the premises occupied by them, in either South Australia, Western Australia, or Tasmania. Perhaps the Postmaster - General will say if that is so ? </para>

                            <para>- I point out that the operation of this rule in New South Wales is frequently a cause of hardship. Some enthusiastic local member has secured the erection of an expensive post and telegraph office, with large accommodation for the post and telegraph master. The man in charge is possibly a bachelor ; the premises are of no use to him except, perhaps, to sleep in ; he gets his meals at the hotel across the road, and yet he is charged a fairly large rent for premises which are of no value to himself, and which are of no value to any one in the community except, possibly, that they may bring some political advantage to the member who engineered their erection. These officers sleep on the premises very much in the character of caretakers, and also for the purpose of transacting their business. We do not charge the ordinary public servant a rent for the desk or space he occupies in a public building during the day, and why should a post and telegraph master, who is compelled to sleep on the premises as caretaker, and for the purpose of receiving and despatching mails and telegrams at all sorts of odd hours, be obliged to_ pa}' for that which, in many eases, is of no value to him? He ought to be charged a fair and reasonable amount, but there should be a maximum provided in the clause, and with that I should be quite satisfied if all are treated alike. Clause 67 contains no provision for granting short leave of absence in consequence of illness. Apparently it would be necessary to set the Minister in motion. We may find that after all the Ministerial head is useful. If he had nothing else to do he might be utilized for the purpose of granting short leave of absence through sickness. Some amendment of clause 67 is necessary in order that there should be no risk of cumbrous machinery to secure that temporary leave, which, unfortunately, so frequently is necessary ; nor should that leave be counted, sis I fear might be the case as the clause is drawn, in the annual leave of absence. I do not think that short periods of such leave should operate against a man who is absent owing to the minor maladies which affect us. 1 wish to speak now in reference to letter carriers. It is unreasonable that there should be, as there is in New South Wales, a very considerable number of letter carriers who also have to do the work of letter sorters who receive the miserable pittance of £26 a year. Ten shillings a week for a man who has to undertake the responsible duties of letter sorting and letter delivering, who has to be early at his work, earlier than most of us would like to be at work, and who has, through stress of weather- </para>

                            <para>.- We have had it abundantly shown that the carrying of Bills which involve questions of large public policy, and are unhappily laden with a mass, of small detail, must needs be slow, and all I desire is that we should make the work as perfect as it can be made. Going back to the question of the inspectors, which is a very vital one, these gentlemen will have very little to do after the first grading is accomplished, but they will have a great deal to do in the, first grading, and it will be most absurd if the work should fall, as indicated, to the views of one man appointed as inspector to each State. It is provided in sub-clause (1) of clause 5 that, by will of the commissioner, an inspector can have all his authority. Imagine what that authority will be when he is far away from head-quarters, and there is no possibility of that authority being overlooked by the commissioner. These inspectors will be charged with an amount of responsibility which we can scarcely foresee, and I imagine that no Ministry could have a much more onerous and difficult task than the selection of suitable men for the position - men -whose duties will involve the interests of the public, though the interests of the public must not be permitted to outweigh justice between man and man, and between a State and its servants, without which the Act, instead of being a public blessing, will earn the execrations of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. The duties of the inspectors are not clearly defined. They are left in the most cheerfully vague manner, and it seems whenever an inspector likes he is authorized to go and harry a department, and absolutely belittle its head in the eyes. of the subordinates. </para>

                            <para>.- No ; but there should be some better definition of what aninspector's duties are. If we let the inspectors loose it will wholly depend upon the character of the man we- have whether we have ill results or not ; because, owing to the extent of the Commonwealth, and the fact that his operations will be so entirely without oversight, he will have opportunities of doing the greatest possible amount of mischief that a public servant perhaps was ever permitted to do. It is provided that he may hear and inquire into all matters and things, affecting or relating to the work of a department. That might be taken to cover almost anything. It would certainly permit him to play the eavesdropper, and to do what has been done in certain cases under Public Service Acts - to closet himself with underlings of the department, and seek information about their superiors. That has happened before now in the world's history. I need not designate the particular spot where it has* happened, but suffice to say that it has happened. If we can guard against - that sort of thing it is our duty to do so. </para>

                            <para>.- My point is that he can do any and all of these things without reference to the head of the department charged with its proper working. And that is one of the initial objections to the Bill. You cannot have discipline without control. You cannot have discipline by the head unless he has control of those under him, and under the Bill he will not have control. He will be as great a cypher in the management of his department as the Minister will be in the administration of the department created by the Bill. Then we find that even heads of departments are entirely ignored in the classification of their subordinates. This is all left to individual inspectors. Unless there is some control exercised over the inspectors, one inspector will take one view at one end of the Commonwealth, and another inspector a different view at the further district of the Commonwealth,1 and instead of securing uniformity we shall secure the very reverse. There are a great many matters of a similar character upon which I could speak if need be at great length, but that is not necessary, because I take it that a Bill .which has passed the other House has had its character and its principles sufficiently indorsed to make it practically useless to attempt conflict with the principle here unless there be some very pronounced reason. There is no pronounced reason. This comes to us as a Bill for revision rather than as a. measure for party conflict. I have referred to some of the matters to which I take exception, and have done so by way of indicating that in committee I shall be prepared to move or to support amendments moved by others, with a view to securing a real]}' valuable working measure, and not one which seems to offer the greatest possible scope- for favoritism and jobbery, because, though you may do away with political patronage, you do not- necessarily do away with personal patronage, and it has over- and over again been said that the drawing-room and clubhouse possess a larger patronage than a hall of legislature. I trust that we I shall secure, as a result of our deliberations, a measure which will be in the public interest, and also in the interest of fair dealing between man and man and between the State and those in its employ. </para>

                        <para>- I propose only to make a "few remarks, considering the hour of the afternoon. I highly approve of the institution of entrance examinations and medical examinations. We represent the community at large, and however much we may feel privately for those in a bad. state of health, it is not fan- to put them in the public service, where we should expect the work of men and women in robust health. As regards the Public Service Commissioner and the six inspectors, I trust that in committee we shall consider whether we ought not to adopt a Public Service Board composed, perhaps, of three commissioners. I notice that in clause 50 there is an appeal only to one commissioner. Remembering what human nature is, it is absurd to suppose that one commissioner can properly be an appeal court for such a large service as the Commonwealth service will ultimately be. </para>

                            <para>- They may be useful also. My impression is that this is a good Bill, and well deserving of the support of the Senate. I hope it will be carefully dealt with in committee. </para>
