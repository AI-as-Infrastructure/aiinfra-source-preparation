          <para>- I desire to put on record my protest, not only against the general character of this Bill, but also, and more particularly, against the way in which it was introduced here and carried through its various stages. In effect it is a postal tariff, and it ought to have been accompanied with all the information that is necessary for its due consideration. That information ought to have been in the hands of honorable senators sufficiently long to enable them to grasp all its details. The Bill should not have been proceeded with until the public of Australia had had a reasonable opportunity offered them of understanding how its details would affect not only the finances of the States, but the various and complicated business interests. I hope, however, that the other House will be afforded fuller details before the Bill is debated, as it is one of great financial importance. It ought to be an understood thing that an important measure affecting the finances of the States generally, and even affecting important business interests, should not be rushed on either House, and should not be passed until the whole of Australia has had an opportunity of carefully considering all the details and of expressing public opinion thereon. </para>

          <para>- Exactly, they are to get a minimum wage on account of mental ability. If we refuse admission to the clerical division to people who are not physically strong, it will mean that no such person will be able to earn his living. If the banks and other large institutions followed the example of the Government, they also would prescribe that unless a person was physically strong they would not employ him. If the avenues of mental employment are closed to such persons, they will have to starve. I do not mean that persons suffering from consumption, and diseases of that description which would be injurious to their fellow workers, should be allowed to enter the service, but there are physical ailments which would by no means incapacitate a man from doing clerical work. We employ 8,000 civil servants, and if the Commonwealth takes over other services, we may employ double that number. It would be very cruel if people on account of physical infirmities were not allowed to enter the service. It would be carrying out the Darwinian theory of the " survival of the fittest," and those who were not physically strong would bo left to starve. </para>

            <para>- We are touching, in. this clause, on one of the most painful problems that have to be considered, and that is, what is to be done with persons who are afflicted with such bad health as to be disqualified for ordinary occupations. In the interests of the public service, I think that they ought to be debarred from entrance to it. Very painful cases have sometimes come under my notice in administering a department. What, for instance, is to be done with an officer of a department who develops consumption? He cannot be turned out upon the streets. He may be entitled to no pension or gratuity, and he refuses to resign. He cannot be permitted to continue to work in a room crowded with other persons, and in one or two such instances what I have had to do has been to give such men practically permanent sick leave. The service must be protected against cases like that. </para>

          <para>- This appears to me to be a merciful provision. If we strike out "may " and put in " shall," it will mean that the officer to whom the commissioner will not give another six months' probation must be dismissed. Under the clause as it stands, if, after a probation of six months, the commissioner comes to the conclusion that an officer is not giving satisfaction he has the option of giving him a further six months' probation, but if the alteration proposed is agreed to, and he must either annul or confirm the appointment at the end of six months, he will annul it. </para>

          <para>- There is evidently a real danger to be apprehended. Even under the Victorian Act these evasions have taken place. This sub-clause is certainly more elastic than the section in that Act, which provides that the appointment shall be for a period of six months absolute, and goes on to say that at the end of that period the Governor in Council may not extend it, but confirm it, and if it is not confirmed he ceases to be in the service. That section has been evaded to a considerable extent in this State. </para>

          <para>- The committee should pause before it accepts the suggestion of the Postmaster-General. The effect of such an amendment would be to disqualify a man not for a short time, but for ever. Supposing that owing to the exigencies of the finances the commissioner had to retrench, and that he discharged any probationers. They would be disqualified to re-enter the public service at anytime, not because they were incapable, but simply because, owing to the exigencies of the Treasury at a certain time, they were not appointed. </para>

            <para>- The object of the probationary period is to find out whether the probationer is a man who should be admitted. As the clause reads now, if at the end of six months the commissioner is not satisfied with the officer, he may allow another six months to see how he shapes, and at the end of that time he has to decide whether the officer has shown himself fit to be admitted. The committee is now asked to provide that if the commissioner then annuls the appointment, the man is not to be eligible for re-admission at once, but may be eligible for re-admission at the end of twelve months. Only two reasons, it seems to me, can be advanced for making that distinction. One is that during the period of twelve months he may so improve that he may become fit for another trial, but I think that is entirely unlikely. </para>

          <para>- The Postmaster-General does not quite grasp the case. In the public service we have an ebb and flow of work. There are times when there may be a sudden increase of work, and then it may be very desirable to take on for a limited period men who have been out of the service for a year. If the commissioner has not power to re-engage those men for a limited time, he may have to take for a limited period men who have had far less experience. The amendment gives a little elasticity which the service requires, and at the same time is just and fair, not only to the service, but to the probationers. </para>

            <para>- We are not dealing with that. What I say is, that at the end of twelve months the probationer will have had two chances to pass the examination, whilst other candidates will have had no chance at all. If this amendment is agreed to it will mean that many a young fellow will say - " Oh, I don't care about the examination, because if I can't pass it now, I shall have another chance in twelve months." Hence he will waste his time. He will be like Mahomet's coffin, hanging between Heaven and earth. If he fails to pass in twelve months he should lose his chance. </para>

            <para>- I regard this as a very wise provision. We want to fill up the ranks of the service in the clerical division with young fellows. It is preferable if they are destined to enter the service that they should take up the profession soon after they leave school. As a rule a young man does not stay at school until he is 21 years of age, and we do not want to leave the door open for the service to be entered by those who have tried some other walk in life and failed. Moreover, the salary for a man who enters the service in the clerical division is at the beginning only £40 a year. How is a man with a wife and eight children to keep himself and his family on £40 per annum ? He has to be three years in the service before getting the minimum wage of £110. The object of inserting this clause is to secure for the service useful young men who have only recently left school and are just starting life. </para>

            <para>- I am not a slave to the idea of working up. We should leave the door open to the appointment of men of the best capacity we can find at all times. I have seen extraordinary anomalies in connexion with the public service. I remember a case in Queensland where a man who had been a draftsman in the Lands office, but who was retrenched, was appointed within a few months to be chief clerk in the Police department. What on earth could that man know about police work ? That is an instance of the stupidity of this iron-bound rule. Would it not have been much better to appoint some solicitor's managing clerk who was Veil acquainted with police business and criminal procedure? I remember another case where a school teacher in Queensland was appointed clerk of patents. He knew nothing whatever about patents. He was afterwards appointed Under-Secretary for Agriculture. I am certain that a young man could have been obtained in Queensland much more fitted for that position -than this ex-school teacher could possibly be. He was a scholarly man, and no doubt a good teacher, but could not have had sufficient knowledge of the kind that would qualify him for the position of UnderSecretary for Agriculture. We ought to extend the age limit. I think 35 would be a fair limit. We should, to use a phrase of the Right Honorable George Reid's, "let air into the public service," and not make a close preserve of it. as seems to be the idea of some honorable senators. Let the friction of competition work within the departments, and I believe that we shall have an improved Commonwealth service instead of one of the pattern so often complained of at present. </para>

The evils of admitting men of mature age would be as bad under this amendment as under any of the other amendments proposed. I think 21 years is a fair limit, and it would do no harm even if the minimum limit of age were lowered.

        <para>That the words "not being of a temporary or casual character," lines 3 and 4, be omitted. </para>
        <para>The clause provides that persons in the railway or other service of a State shall be eligible to be transferred to a position in a corresponding division in the Commonwealth service, but it bars the transfer of all those whose employment is of a temporary or casual character. It has been frequently stated in the chamber by Senators Sargood, Dobson, and Playford that in some States there are a number of officers whose employment, in the language of their State Acts, has been of a temporary character, Although some of these men have been employed for ten or twenty years. For instance, the employment of the " pro and tem " men in South Australia would certainly be held to be of a temporary or casual character. If this privilege is to be allowed to those who have the distinction of being permanent officers, it should also be extended to those who are under the disability of being known as " pro and tem " officers. After all, it does not bind the Commonwealth to take over any men. It is left with the commissioner to decide whether the services of any men shall be Accepted. It gives the men the right to apply for an appointment, and if their application be approved they can be appointed to a position in the corresponding division in the Commonwealth service. I think that the Government might very well accept my amendment. </para>

        <para>SenatorDRAKE. - To make them eligible is practically to hold out hope to such men that they can get into the Federal service. If the State has been employing these men for five, ten, or fifteen years, and they are to be continued in employment, out of charity, surely it is the State which should find them work? What the clause contemplates is that there might be in the Railway department of a State an officer occupying a high position whose services might be very much desired by the Federal Government, and it is considered that he should not be debarred from entering our service. But its object is not to throw the service of the Commonwealth open to a number of men who are getting near 60 years of age, who are not permanently employed and whose services perhaps are not particularly required by the States. I think that there should be some limitation of this kind made. </para>

          <para>- We have now reached a very important clause, dealing with a subject which has not been touched upon in the discussions upon preceding clauses. It gives to the Minister the power to put on temporary assistance in his department whenever he thinks it is necessary. The clause brings up the whole question of temporary appointments. Temporary assistance is necessary sometimes in order to carry on the business of the departments, but the appointment of temporary officers should be surrounded by safeguards, and it should not be within the power of the Minister to make them even for a nominally short time. The amendments which I have circulated require that temporary appointments shall be made on the recommendation of a responsible officer, and not at the mere dictum of the Minister. I intend to move, first of all, that the words - "in the opinion of" be omitted. Then I propose to insert after the word " department,"the words - " upon the report of the permanent head or the chief officer of such department, is of opinion that." The clause will then read - </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator surely forgets what transpired in Victoria before the Public Service Act was passed. I have known cases in which appointments have been made in the teeth of the permanent officer. I am providing that the Minister shall not act without having the advice of his responsible officer. I mention the permanent head, because we are in a position different from that of the States. There is now a permanent officer over the whole department, and what was formerly called the " permanent head " in the States, becomes the chief officer. The chief officer of a department cannot communicate with the Minister except through the permanent head. My object is that the Minister shall not, on his own motion, be allowed to make temporary appointments. ' Take, for instance, the Victorian railways. A recent report has shown that, within the last five years, the temporary officers have increased from 712 to 2,630. </para>

            <para>- I am speaking of what I know, and I think I know a great deal more of the departments than the honorable senator. I am anxious to prevent this abuse of temporary appointments, which is not fair to those permanently employed. I know of one department in which there are eight officers who have been temporarily employed for an average of over four years, and one of them has been on the temporary staff for seven years. If we wish to have a healthy system we must take some steps to place the employment of temporary officers on a proper footing. If my amendment does not carry out that object, I shall be glad to accept one that will. In my opinion, the clause as it stands at present is very dangerous, and leaves too much power in the hands of the Minister. I therefore move - </para>

I do not go as far as many honorable senators in thinking it advisable to place all power in the hands of the Minister, but in this matter of temporary employment I think Ministers may be trusted. </para>

          <para>- It is to be regretted that this item should have been brought forward in a Supply Bill of this character, although, I presume, it could not be avoided. The item is certainly worthy of serious consideration. This is the first occasion upon which it has come before the Commonwealth Parliament. It is an expenditure to which the States' have been committed by State legislation, and the Federal Parliament is to be committed to it, to some extent, without any consideration as to whether we are doing justice to the Empire, or justice to Australia. The hurried manner in which this Bill must be dealt with this afternoon precludes any general discussion. It would be better if some temporary arrangement could be made so that we might deal with the item on the Estimates. We should then have time to thoroughly discuss it, and to obtain full information upon the subject. </para>

          <para>- I think it is well that this question has been raised. I would ask honorable senators to consider whether it is not desirable that the squadron, instead of remaining in Sydney Harbor from years' end to years' end, should sail round the coast of Australia and make calls at different ports. For instance, Victoria contributes something like £29,000 or £30,000 per annum towards the cost of the squadron, and it is only once a a year - during the Cup festivities - that the exigencies of the State are considered to require its presence in the Bay. No doubt the colonies made a splendid bargain when they agreed to contribute to the maintenance of the auxiliary squadron. </para>

            <para>- We cannot have a navy of our own. We are better as we are under the protection of the old flag. Having entered into this bargain, we should derive as much benefit from it as possible. I am sure that if some of the vessels of the squadron called at the principal ports of the Commonwealth two or three times a year, instead of remaining in Sydney Harbor all the year round, it would be a good thing. It would be far better for us to pay the cost of the coal required to enable these vessels to go from port to port, and to exercise their men in rough seas, than to allow them to lie idle in Port Jackson. </para>

          <para>Provided always that the claim made by the Imperial Government, under this head, does not exceed the annual payment of £91,000. £126,000 is the annual cost of the squadron subject to modification from time to time. The accounts show that for this year the amount is £106,000, but it is necessary, I am told, to ask for less than the actual amount in order to leave full opportunity for discussion on another occasion. The amount of £126,000 may be subject to some adjustment, but it is estimated that that 'will be the contribution of the Commonwealth under that article of the agreement. AVith regard to the warships being moved about from place to place, when the-agreement was entered into, New Zealand and one other State made the stipulation that one vessel should periodically visit its waters. With that exception the movements of the squadron have been left, and wisely left, to the control of the Admiral. We must all recognise that we do not pay this sum in order to have the opportunity of seeing the ships occasionally, and perhaps deriving some advantage from their calling in at different ports. We pay the money as a protection to Australia, and for that reason it is recognised that the movements of the fleet shall be under the control of the Admiral, </para>

But if we wish to do justice to the Empire, and to take up the position in the world which other nations think we are going to take, from our action in reference to the war in South Africa ; we shall have to see, no matter what it may cost, that every boy and youth in the Commonwealth is possessed of a rifle, and the necessary ammunition to enable him to join a rifle-club and learn how to shoot. My idea of retrenchment is to give every boy and man a rifle and ammunition. I desire no floating batteries, no land batteries, and no gunships. I wish to see that the very element of the great colonial defence is formed, and. hot dashed to. the ground by silly notions of retrenchment. </para>

            <para>- I assume that members of another Chamber will be visiting these federal capita] sites at some time during the next month or two. They may decide to visit them while members of the Senate are engaged in discussing the Tariff. If it is necessary that members should visit these sites before coming to a decision as to where the federal capital should be, I should like to know when it is proposed that members of the Senate shall visit them. I think that a good time would be during the interval between now and our next meeting. </para>

            <para>- If it is too hot we wish to find out the disabilities of the proposed sites as well as their advantages. If we postpone the proposed visit indefinitely we may land ourselves in such a position that our work here will prevent our making the visit at all, and we shall not be able to come to a proper conclusion. I think a week during our recess might be spent in this way, and that would be preferable to postponing the visit indefinitely. Some honorable senators seem to think that the time is coming when the Senate will have very little to do. When we first came here I was inclined to think that our Chairman of Committees would not have much to do, but I see very little prospect of that time arriving for some years. We have legislation in front of us that will keep us going for months. I should like to know if the Postmaster-General is in a position to say when he thinks the proposed visit might be made. </para>

I think it is quite relevant to that to discuss whether we should during the recess visit these sites, but it is hardly relevant to discuss whether we shall remain in Melbourne for the next twenty years, or have a new capital of our own.

            <para>. - In rising to move the adjournment of the Senate for a longer period than usual, I wish to mention that, having in view the desirability of obtaining as long a holiday as possible without any detriment to the public business, it is considered advisable for the Senate to adjourn at its rising until the 22nd January next. I understand that another place will adjourn for a much shorter period, but there is a considerable amount of business to be dealt with by that Chamber, which will not be ready to come before us until perhaps a fortnight after it re-assembles. There is one unfinished Bill before the Senate, but having consulted a number of honorable senators, I have come to the conclusion that we should adjourn until the date that I have named. As this will be the first time that we have adjourned for a similar purpose, I trust that I may be permitted, on behalf of the Government, to wish you, sir, and honorable members of the Senate, a very happy Christmas. I Hope we shall meet again in January in good health and spirits ready to proceed with the work of the session. I move - </para>

I have also been requested by several members of the party to which I belong - and I am sure I join with them in their desire - to express the wish that you, sir, may enjoy a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I hope that honorable senators will meet again on the 22nd of next month in good health and good temper, prepared to proceed with the business of the country. </para>
