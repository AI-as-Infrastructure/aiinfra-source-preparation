                    in bis question, has offered an opinion that the proposed procedure will obtain the best possible working results from the Parliament. I am not going to ask the honorable senator to alter his question ; but I wish to give notice to honorable senators generally that in future they ought to observe the standing order.

                    <para>- On Thursday last, when speaking relative to the, in time, possible importation of worn silver coin to be withdrawn by the Commonwealth mint, I said that something like £70,000 of worn silver coin was sent from Australasia annually to the Imperial Mint. I find that I made a mistake. I ought to have said that for the twenty-eight years ending December, 1899, the imports of silver coin to Australasia averaged £70,000 a year more than the exports - really imports £88,000 or£89,000 per annum as against worn silver exported, averaging £18,000 a year. Needless to say, as our population is greatly in excess of what it was 28 or 30 years since, the figures must be expected to show a substantial annual increase ; still I was surprised to see by the Imperial Mint returns for the year 1900 that the exports of silver coin for Australasia totalled £297,000 - surely quite exceptional. </para>

                    must see that what he has said does not really apply. I explained that the person \f hose goods may be on top of the cargo 1 may not ' pass his entries, and may consequently block all the rest of the importers. The honorable and learned senator must himself see that this will practically stop the unloading.

                        <para>- The wharfowner will not permit them to be landed, and stored on his wharf for seven days. He will say, "I am not going to allow these goods to remain on my wharf." Then there will be trouble. People who are desirous of obtaining their goods, will not be able to get them. It is easy enough in Melbourne, where the goods can be landed and stored in a. Government shed without any expense to the consignee ; but the case is different in Port Adelaide. If the clause is allowed to stand as it is a most -serious injury will be done to the trade of' Port Adelaide, because the ship will have to be sent from the wharf back to the buoy, and will have to be tied up at the expense of the owner, whose men will not be able to do any work. Honorable senators must see that, for the reasons stated by the Adelaide Chamber of Commerce, it is desirable that the clause should be amended as I suggest. I hope that the committee will not place the people of Port Adelaide under the 12 az disadvantage- this clause would impose upon them. </para>

                    (Tasmania).Prom a practical experience of -upwards of 30 years as a ship agent,- 1 have never found any difficulty placed in the way of consignees getting possession of their .goods, because airy particular consignee has not been in a hurry to get his entries passed. The practice in unloading sailing ships has been that where ;woods are come across, for which the entries have not been passed, they are taken up and put on deck, and when the other goods -required have been taken out they are put back until entries have been passed for them. It very often happens that goods for which entries have not been passed are taken out of the ship and placed in the King's warehouses. We have had the seven days' period allowed in Tasmania, and I have seen ho delay in consequence. The full seven days is seldom required, and there is no trouble about it.
                </para>
                <para>
                    (South Australia). - In answer to that, I can quote a case where a dry goods merchant has been extremely anxious to obtain his goods as quickly as possible. He has passed his entries as soon as the ship has been sighted, and has urged upon the captain to facilitate the landing of the goods. The captain has started to discharge, and after working* for half an hour, he has come upon goods for which entries have not been passed, with the result that the unloading has been stopped at once, and the dry goods merchant has been compelled to wait the full 4S hours, until the owner of the other goods has been forced to pass his entries. In the case of steamers, the time allowed at Port Adelaide is -24 hours, and the Collector of Customs often gives a permit to land goods at once. People, knowing that the time is limited, have everything ready to pass -their entries, and there is no difficulty. Why should one man be permitted to delay the unloading of a ship for a number of days while he is trying to dispose of the goods he has on board ? I may perhaps better explain the difficulty by an illustration. If I had a number of cases of spirits to land, and I was not anxious to get them immediately, as soon as I heard of the arrival of the ship I would look around to see if I could dispose of these goods. Under this provision I should have seven days in which to do it, with the result that for that time I would delay passing my entries." It has been said that in some cases goods are landed and stored, but at whose expense ? In the case I have instanced, I would say that it should not be done at my expense, because I would insist that I had seven days in which to pass entries.

                    in this matter, because the advice given to me is that we should ask that the seven days' period be increased to fourteen days. I can clearly see that there is something special in the case of Port Adelaide, and under the circumstances it would be a fair tiling if the Vice-President of the Executive Council would consent to have this clause recommitted. Something in the meantime might be suggested that would enable the special case of Port Adelaide to be met, without inflicting a new departure of a severe character upon the other ports of Australia.

                    <para>- It would be rather difficult to arrange in the clause for various periods for different ports, but as there is such a difference in the practice, the clause might be amended in such a way as to allow the periods to be fixed " as prescribed " for different ports. That would leave the matter in the hands of the Minister, after consulting .the collectors of customs at the various ports, to prescribe the most suitable time for each, within which entries should be passed. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think it is necessary to say so. It will be quite open to make different regulations for different ports in other matters. There is no use in loading up the clause with the suggestion that there may be differences,when perhaps, it may be found that there is no necessity to have any differences. On the other hand, if it is necessary, and if it is possible constitutionally to make different rules for different ports, it can be done by the wording I suggest. </para>

                    (South Australia.) - I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. At the same time, I would like to have an assurance that the regulations can be so framed as to suit the different conditions. It is extremely difficult to make one suit of clothes fit every person, and I can see very clearly that under federation, where the States conduct their trade under various conditions, it will be almost impossible to have one regulation to guide them. If the words " as may be prescribed " will give all the elasticity which is essential to the successful conduct of the business, I am quite prepared to accept them, and at a later stage, if necessary, we shall have another opportunity to discuss the matter. I hope that
                    will inform his colleagues that it is the desire of the Senate that the regulations shall be so framed as practically to meet the working conditions of the various ports.

                    <para>- The penalty of £100 is very drastic for the offence contemplated in the clause. In the case of a ship, hundreds of such entries may have to be passed, and the non-passing of any one entry may lead to a heavy penalty. I do not propose any amendment, but I ask honorable members to bear this clause in mind when we come to the provision that the minimum penalty shall not be less than one-twentieth of the maximum. I shall ask honorable members to strike that provision out, or to allow the minimum to be reduced. </para>

These transhipped goods are intended to be taken out of the port, and do not pay duty ; and if they are not sent direct to the ship, a. call might be made on some coaster, and a portion of the cargo left there for the purpose of being smuggled. The clause is an exceedingly involved one; and it is difficult to understand the latter* part of it. </para>

                        <para>- If the bill of lading provides for any different method, I presume that the contract will have to be carried out. But there will be no real difficulty about the matter. A certain time in most of these cases is allowed to the consignee to take out his goods. It may be necessary for the ship-owner and master to put the goods out of the ship before that period has arrived. Under those circumstances, the owner or master still remains liable. This is not an unusual provision. </para>

                    <para>- This clause shows how necessary it is in the interest of the ship-owner that the time of landing the goods shall be limited as much as possible. In South Australia entries have to be made within 24 hours. Steamers come to a port and leave it again within twelve hours, when they have not many tons of cargo to land, and are able to get a permit to land it from the Collector of Customs. The goods are put into a shed for the 24 hours, and then the consignee must take his goods, or they are at his risk. Under that system a steamship would be released of liability in less than 24 hours, whereas in the other case to which I referred, the liability would, under the clause, remain for seven days. If goods are landed to suit the convenience of the ship-owner, it should be at his expense. </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator has been on the wrong track, because this particular clause has nothing to do with the time within which people may pass entries. This has to do with the case in which a man has neglected to pass any entry at all, and goods are landed from a ship under the collector's permit. The ship wants to clear, and the goods are placed in some secure spot selected by the collector. The question then arises - at whose risk are they to remain? It appears to me that they should remain at the risk of the persons at whose risk they would have been, supposing that they had never been landed from the ship. That is- exactly what the clause provides, and that is the proper course to pursue. Under these circumstances, I shall have to vote against the proposed amendment. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - There is no doubt a great deal in what the honorable senator has said as to the meaning and effect of the clause. But is it reasonable to provide that if these goods have had to be landed in consequence of the neglect of the consignee to pass his entries, and in order to facilitate the business of the ship, which, after all, only conveys the goods from port to port, the ship-owner shall be the person responsible in the event of anything happening to the goods after they are landed
                    I say the consignee should be responsible, the man through whose neglect it has been necessary to land the goods, and place them in the warehouse.

                    <para>- There is another point to which attention has not been directed. It not infrequently happens that goods are landed under a special permit from the collector for the convenience of the ship. Not long since a ship having a large consignment of goods for my firm called at Perth, and by special permit of the collector a considerable portion of those goods was landed at Perth, and subsequently brought on to Melbourne. Honorable senators will agree that, in such a case it is right that the ship should be responsible, and not the consignee. This is an exceptional transaction, and the clause appears to me to provide the only way in which it can be dealt with. </para>

The liability that is cast upon the master is part of the contract he has made with the persons shipping the goods.Any one who has read a bill of lading must know that the ship-owner is amply protected, and he would have no further responsibility under this clause than is cast upon him by his contract with the shipper of the goods.

He is not bound to pass his entry for six days, but the ship-owner may say to him - " You are bound to take your goods within 24 hours, and, therefore, we shall land them at your risk." In the clause, however, we say that the goods -

                    <para>- I propose to substitute the word "three" for the word "four" in line 1, so that there shall be three classes of licensed warehouses, and then to omit Class I'll. It will be observed that the first class includes warehouses belonging to people who follow the business of warehousing, and take in goods for all kinds of importers. The second class includes private bonds that belong to importers who are in a considerable way of business. The fourth class includes a warehouse in which, by authority, goods that are to undergo some manufacturing operation may be placed, and the- manufacturing process carried on with a view to- avoiding waste. Then we have something which is to be called a" machinery warehouse, but whether it is to be a private or a general warehouse, or- both, we do not know. This provision appears to me to put on the importers considerable and unnecessary hardship. If an importer has a bonded warehouse of his own, why should he not be allowed to put into it a piece of machinery which he imports ? </para>

I cannot see any occasion for multiplying warehouses in the way indicated, and I therefore urge that the limitation- I have suggested be adopted.

                    <para>- I am not particular as to the language of the clause, but I can tell the committee where the idea of it came from. It came from South Australia, whence so many good ideas emanate. I do not remember the actual wording of the section in the South Australian Act, but I can give honorable senators an instance in which, while I was Treasurer, I adopted such a practice as would be permitted under this clause. I have no doubt that I did it under legal authority. A man in South Australia wanted to manufacture starch. Starch is made from a good many articles, one of the principal of which is rice. In South Australia we had a duty of so much a pound on rice, lt was not a protective, but a re venue duty. This gentleman wanted to use inferior rice which he imported from various parts of the world, and, as Treasurer, I granted permission to him to import such rice duty free, on the understanding that it was dealt with in a bonded warehouse, under the control of a Customs official, and was used only for the purposes of making starch. That was encouraging an industry precisely in the same way as one could be encouraged under this clause. The Treasurer should be able to do that in certain cases. We may want to impose a duty on articles used for ordinary purposes of consumption, but may desire that those articles shall come in free if they are to be used for manufacturing purposes. Under this clause that could be done. It is therefore necessary to have some such provision, and discretion must be given to some one. It appears to me that the giving of the discretion as here proposed is right and proper. </para>

If he thinks that any premises will afford opportunities for fraud, he can, without giving any reason at all, refuse a licence for them. He can, therefore, absolutely protect the department without the insertion of these words. Before he will grant a licence for a warehouse the person applying for it will no doubt have to satisfy him that the premises for which he asks a licence are suitable for the kind of licence he applies for. The clause would perhaps be more comprehensive without these words than with them. The Minister could grant a licence subject to such conditions as he might think fit. </para>

Whatever the class of goods may be of which an account has to be taken, certain details will be required. Whether the duty is to be paid by weight or by measurement, various details will require to be considered ; but I contend that it would be better to say that the account to be taken shall be " as prescribed." I am certain that, whether the words I suggest are inserted or not, the officers will be directed as to the particulars that are required. I have no desire to press the amendment.

                        <para>- I do not think we could leave it to the collector ; it would be a bad thing to give him any more authority than is necessary. He might allow it in one case and not in. another where it might just as fairly be allowed. Honorable senators will see that in regard to some goods, such as spirituous liquors, upon which the duty must always be high, there will always be a temptation to evade the payment of the duty where possible, and if we permitted repacking in such cases we should risk the loss of a large quantity of goods. That is the reason why in all cases the authority to pack and repack and bottle is restricted, and the work is to be done under authority only. It is exactly the same principle as that of allowing goods to be imported in certain sized packages only. At first sight that seems to be a very grave interference with the liberty of the subject, but it has always been recognised that if dutiable articles are allowed to be imported in smaller packages than the sizes specified smuggling is facilitated, and the detection of smuggling made more difficult. This is really a. regulation of that kind. We must take it that the regulation will be reasonable, and that there will be no more interference than is necessary. </para>

                    <para>. - Where dutiable articles are allowed to be warehoused for manufacturing purposes, and a portion of them is used in the manufacture of goods, then the duty which is prescribed represents the proportion of the article which has been used for manufacturing purposes. Supposing, for example, that a certain amount of caustic soda is necessary for the manufacture of soap, and that it is a dutiable article ; it is allowed to go into the factory, and when the soap comes out for home consumption the regulations prescribe the amount of duty which shall be paid on the caustic soda it contains. That, I think, is the explanation of the clause. </para>

                    <para>- I understand exactly what the clause aims at, and although the language is possibly a little involved, still it is evident what it means. Supposing that a man is manufacturing an article, we allow him, under certain rules and conditions, to store in his warehouse any dutiable raw material which he requires to use in the manufacturing process. We do not want to charge any duty in respect of any portion of the dutiable article which he may export in the manufactured goods. But we want him to pay the duty on the dutiable article which was used in the manufactured goods entered for home consumption and sold to the merchants. As I read the clause, it expresses that meaning, though perhaps not so clearly as it might do. I think it will accomplish that object. Under no circumstances will the regulations be able to impose a duty higher than that which is prescribed in the Tariff. </para>

                    <para>- This clause is to enable the collector to interfere where he thinks there is fraudulent dealing with goods. The storing of goods in a private warehouse is a privilege granted by the Crown, and the clause simply leaves it to the discretion of the collector to withdraw that privilege, if he considers there are sufficient grounds for doing so. If there be reason to believe that goods are being dealt with in such a way as to cause loss of revenue, there must be this power of control. </para>

The officer who gauges arid- treasures' is practically the locker, and his expenses are paid ' by the Warehousemen' in the heavy licence-fee. It is only the' owner of the goods who is interested in 'having the articles re-gauged or re-weighed"; and the clause seems like an attempt on the part of the Government to make him pay double fees. A request for ' re-gauging or re-weighing would be made in order to enable a warehouseman to act honestly by the Government, and it is very clear that this double charge ought not to be imposed. </para>
                <para>
                    -- This clause is really for the benefit of ' the owner of the goods. Goods which have been in a warehouse for some time may have become lessened in weight or in value, and if the duty had to be paid on the goods as they had went into the warehouse, a grave injustice might be done to the owner, for whose benefit the fresh measurements or weights are taken. A special officer has to be called in to do the work; and it is only right that the owner should pay the cost, seeing that it is quite sufficient for the Government to have the work done once. If the clause be amended in the way suggested, it would be left iri the power of the Government to either grant or refuse the request of the owner, and the next clause deals with one set of circumstances under which this request may be made. That clause provides that warehoused' goods which are subject to
                    duty, arid which have deteriorated in value, may be re-valued on the application of the owner, and that the duty shall be paid according to the result if' the' collector is satisfied that the deterioration has been accidentally caused. The deterioration may be in value, or by loss of weight, and it is only reasonable that the party who wants the re-guaging or remeasuring should pay the expense. . If the amendment bts carried it would be much against the interests of the owners of- goods.

                    (South Australia). - lam given to understand that the locker at Port Adelaide does the weighing. It is possible that in a great port like Melbourne there may be- a subdivision of duties. It is only fair that a warehouse-keeper who asks that goods should be re-gauged or re-weighed, should not have to pay again if the work is done by a locker whose services he has already paid for.

                    Sargood is - assuming that I can show that the locker in Port Adelaide is the man who does the re-gauging or re-weighing - quite in sympathy with my contention. I would, therefore, ask

                    approves of the principle of the amendment ; but he is in error in supposing that that principle is already carried out in the clauses he has read.Clause30 does not refer to goods on which the duty has been paid, but refers to goods for exportation beyond the seas, under which circumstances there is no payment of duty, and the goods remain under Customs control until finally exported. My amendment covers a case of loss in which duty has actually been paid on the goods.

                        <para>-I am willing to accept the principle up to the point that, wherever an accident happens while the goods are actually under Customs control, there should be a reimbursement of the duty; and that is provided for in the Bill. If the duty has been paid and anything happens when goods for home consumption are being delivered by lighter from the warehouse to a wharf, then, delivery not having been completed, the owner of the goods is entitled to a reimbursement of the duty under the clauses I have quoted. But if the goods have been actually delivered on the wharf or in some other way, and they are being sent to somewhere far inland, surely the honorable senator does not ask that in case of accident the Government are to be held responsible fora reimbursmentof the duty until the goods actually reach the place of final delivery!When once the Customs officials deliver the goods for home consumption they ought to be able to wash their hands of the matter, otherwise there would be a great deal of difficulty with claims made in respect of the subsequent destruction of the goods. The English section does not go a single step further than the clauses to which I have directed attention. </para>

                <para>SenatorLt.-Col. NEILD. - It would never happen that goods for home consumption would be sent in a lighter to the wharf . When the Customs officers part with the goods at the door of the bond, there is an end to their control.However, I do not think that the question is worth fighting. If goods imported for home consumption are lost in transit in the Commonwealth, the duty would be only a small portion of the loss, unless the goods happened to be spirits or something of that kind ; and so long as goods are water borne all risk can be covered by marine insurance, which would entail no more trouble on the owner of the goods, while the expense would be infinitesimal. </para>

I should think that delivery of goods for conveyance byrail,say, to Bourke, would be complete when they had been handed over to the railway people, and delivery of goods for conveyance by sea to a port in Queensland when they had been placed on board the steamer. It is to meet the internal only that, in accordance with the English practice, I ask the committee to accept the amendment.

                    has given to that word a meaning that is limited practically to a single act. In other words, "delivery" according to him seems to represent something instantaneous. Clause 30 says that goods shall be subject to the control of the Customs department from the time of importation to the time of delivery. We have to give to the word " delivery " in. that clause an instantaneous effect. We have to regard it as a single act. It would allow no opportunity for loss. But it is evident from reading the English Act that " delivery " can mean something else. It seems to me to distinctly imply a process spread over a certain amount of time. The English Act says -

Supposing that 100 tons, of sugar lying in a bonded warehouse at the water's side- have had ;£500 cash paid in duty upon , them. it may take one, two, three, or fo.ur days perhaps to deliver that sugar in lighters to the warehouse. When one-half of the sugar has been .delivered there may be .an accident . on the river. Some, vessel may collide with the lighter and half the sugar mav be- lost. Is it not a fair thing that the Customs department should refund to the owner of the.sugar the amount represented by. the sugar that has been lost ' at the .very door of the warehouse1? That is a thing that might easily happen, and in a great country like Australia it is a fair and proper thing that we should have a reasonable clause in our Customs Act so as to secure that the revenue derived from goods refers only to goods that are consumed; and not to goods that do not go into consumption.

                        <para>- Supposing goods are left in a warehouse until the value of the dues and the duties is 'equal to the value of the goods, what would be the .position of the Customs then, and where are they going to get their duties from ? That should show that they have an interest in these warehouses. Although the Customs are here dealing with private individuals, the warehouses are in a sense public, and under public control, and there seems to me no reason why the Customs officials should not aid iri the collection of the dues for these warehouses, it is a common provision which honorable senators will find in all these Customs statutes. </para>

                    (New South Wales).Senator O'Connor pointed out the double charges that are running through this matter, and advanced that as a reason why this clause should remain as it is. But the double charges only run for six months, and we, have a provision in the Bill under which the Government may have to wait for three years before they get their duty. If the owner of the warehouse is prepared to wait for three years for his rent, why should he not be allowed to do so? It should be entirely a matter of private arrangement between the owner of the goods and the owner of the warehouse in which they are bonded.

                    <para>- The reason for the clause .is that the warehouses are licensed, and pay a rent to the Crown, and, to a certain extent, it is the manifest duty of the Government to protect the owners of them. It is not as if this clause entailed needless interference on the part of the Government, because the power given is permissive and not mandatory, and under certain conditions it is desirable that the Government should be able to move in the matter. The clause seems to me to be a reasonable one. </para>

                    <para>- I think there is a great deal of force in the contention of honorable senators in regard to the recovery of these warehouse clues. The owner of a warehouse should recover his .money as any ordinary person would have to do. I could quite understand this proposal where goods were bonded in a King's warehouse.It would be reasonable in such a case that the collector should have power to sell goods for the purpose of defraying the warehouse charges; but it is not reasonable to give an ordinary individual owning a warehouse this extremely summary way of collecting his money. </para>

I am troubled to know how they are to find the owner under this clause if he cannot be discovered when required under clause96, when a notice is to be served on him for his own benefit.

                    can enlighten the committee on the subject.

                        <para>- Surely my honorable friend does not say that the term " combustible or inflammable goods " means only goods that will burn. What is clearly intended are such goods as benzine, naphtha, fireworks, petroleum, kerosene, gasolene, and matches.Why should there not be a power in the Customs-house officer to see that care is taken in the storing of such goods? If there must be a power placed in his hands it cannot be limited by putting a definition by the Bill, because there may be a combination of goods which it may not be possible to foresee in any system of regulations . It is so much to the interest of the Custom-house itself, as well as to that of the owners of goods and the keepers of these stores,that everything should be worked amicably, and to the mutual convenience of all parties that it must not be presumed that the Customs-house officials will take upon themselves unnecessarily the power of throwing out goods, or making any unreasonable conditions. They will exercise these stringent powers only when they are essential. It must be admitted that there ought to be a power of this kind, to be used when the occasion arises. </para>

                    <para>- Clause 121 certainly gives a very great security for the carrying out of the law, because it is required that a certificate shall be given to the Collector of Customs of any goods subject to the control of the Customs. This certificate is to be produced in proof of the due landing of the goods exported. The collector may refuse to allow any other goods to be exported by any person who has failed to produce a certificate concerning, any previous goods exported by him. The clause now under discussion makes the person who has exported the goods give a certificate that they have been dealt with according to the entry, and in default he is not allowed to export any other goods. It puts a block upon his dealings with the Customs-house, and makes him careful to see that the entry is carried out. That is to say, if the goods are to be exported to a certain place, he takes good care that they go there. That is the purpose the clause has in view. I am not quite certain that clause 121 is sufficient. It seems to me to be necessary that the Customs should have some provision with regard to the goods themselves. Clause 121 is all very well after the goods have gone, because it provides that a certificate shall be given. But that certificate can only be made effectual as a remedy if the person who has given a wrong certificate wishes to export more goods. In this clause it is provided that a certificate shall be given that the goods are landed at the place for which they are entered. Therefore the person who exports goods will take good care to know what is going to be done with them. I do not see any hardship in the owner of goods having to give a security of this kind. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council thoroughly understands this matter. He speaks of it as being a simple affair. As a matter of fact the clause is really a copy of a very old section of a very old Act. An exporter may send goods to New Zealand ; all he does is to pass the drawback entries absolutely correctly. The goods then go on board a ship, and the exporter loses all control over them. Whether the ship reaches its destination, or whether the goods are re-landed in Victoria, he has no power whatever over them. The Bill asks the exporter to give a certificate to the effect that the goods shall be landed at the place to which they are entered. To ask him to do that is to ask an impossibility. What happened when this provision was in force in Victoria? There was then a considerable trade between Victoria and New Zealand. The Customs department required a certain form to be signed by the merchant in Victoria and then a declaration had to be made by the customer in New Zealand that he had received the goods. It was carried out for a few months, after which the New Zealand buyers simply rebelled. They said they would not bother to sign these declarations, and that the Victorian Customs must look after their own interests. Our friends in New South Wales very wisely stepped in, and, not requiring this absurd declaration, took the trade from Victoria. A similar thing will happen again if this provision is to be enforced. First of all it is impossible for the seller to sign such a declaration honestly, and, secondly, he cannot carry it out. It is nonsense to punish him for what he cannot do. </para>

                        <para>- This provision is on the statute-book in all the States except Tasmania, where an amendment was adopted a little while ago putting the duty of giving the certificate on the master of the ship. But the master's certificate may be of little value to the Customs officials in the event of his never coming back again. I really do not see that there will be very much advantage in adopting the Tasmanian system. On the other hand, I freely admit, after the statement of experienced gentlemen like Senators Macfarlane and Sargood, that there is a good deal of difficulty in carrying out the provision, which has been to some extent a dead letter. As the same effect can practically be obtained under clause 121, and as the amount of benefit which is derived from having this clause upon the statute-book does not appear to be worth talking about, I shall consent to the amendment. </para>

                    <para>- It is necessary now for us to remember the practice that ships clearing for Europe generally adopt. When our uniform Tariff comes into existence, and we have one Custom's law instead of six, there will, I presume, be a number of clearances instead of one. The English Act gives in detail the method of clearing any ship, and then it provides in section 129 - </para>

                    <para>- The honorable senator is quite right in thinking that it will be necessary to have a clearance at every port. That is provided for in the Bill. The long elaborate section of the English Act is not really necessary. The honorable senator will see that the clause as it is will apply. If a ship going from one port to another - say, from Perth to Adelaide - does any business at Adelaide, it must be entered with the Customs there, and then the ship must get another clearance if she is going out again. If there is no dealing with the Customs-house at all, and the vessel simply lands passengers, her clearance outwards may not be necessary, but wherever it is necessary to get a certificate of clearance, these particulars must be given. </para>

                    <para>- What is meant by the word " manifest " ? There is no definition of the term in the Bill. I know that it means a detailed, statement of the cargo carried, and that it does not include stores. But according to this clause the master of a ship would be precluded from taking stores on board,' because they would not be referred to in the manifest. I think, therefore, that stores should be specially mentioned in the clause. </para>

There is no doubt it would not be included in the ship's manifest, and it is a very important item. If this clause were interpreted strictly as it stands, I should be sorry to be a master of any ship, because he might innocently, and in a hundred-and-one ways, render himself liable to a penalty of £50. </para>

                        <para>- It was pointed out very clearly on clause 112 that it was not a reasonable thing to expect a merchant, who had disposed of his goods, to give a security of this character, and that is one reason why the clause was amended. Having amended clause 112, clause 121 is unnecessary, as well as undesirable. When a merchant has exported his goods and has lost absolute control of them, how can he be afterwards held responsible for the due landing of the goods in any other part of the world ? It is quite unreasonable to require a certificate of this kind, and how much more unreasonable is the latter part of the clause, which says that the collector may refuse to allow any other goods, subject to the control of the Customs, to- be exported by any person who fails within a reasonable time to produce such certificate of the landing of any such goods previously exported by him ? Is that a reasonable provision to put into any Customs Bill, and is there any necessity for it in order to protect the Customs revenue ? We have already recognised the fact that, once goods are exported, the man who exports them cannot by any possibility be responsible for the due landing of them in any portion- of the world, and now under this clause we are going to enact that the collector may require from' him a certificate of the due landing of the goods. We recognise that' the exporter cannot be responsible, and then we go on to say that if he does not give a certificate on a matter which cannot be within his knowledge, he is not to be allowed in future to export any goods which are 'under Customs control. </para>

                    <para>- The committee will see from the form of the clause that it is really a reserve power. It is not to be enforced in' every case. It is not part of the ordinary routine on the outward shipment of goods ; it is simply a reserve power, and the question is whether it ought to be given. It is to be assumed that the powers given in the Bil! will be- exercised reasonably. If they are- not to be exercised reasonably we might just as well tear up' the Bill, and any Customs Acts in force in the States, because in all of them powers are given which if exercised unreasonably or unfairly would turn the Custom-house into the most oppressive engine of tyranny that one could possibly imagine. It is only because these powers are necessary and have to be exercised on certain occasions that they are to be intrusted to the hands of these officers with the belief, generally well justified, that they will not be put into execution unless the necessity arises. Government officers, like every body else, do not like to undertake heavy responsibilities without some reason. Customs officers do not take upon themselves the exercise of these powers unless there is some justification. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator is often in a position in which it may be to his interest to take one view of the Customs officers' duty, and to their interest to take another view. I think, considering his position, he shows a wonderful fairness in dealing with the Bill. At the same time, no one can deny that it is sometimes to the interest of persons not to take the same view of the matter as the Custom-house officer. What cases is this reserve power intended to deal with ? Goods are landed here to be exported to New Caledonia or some other place outside the Commonwealth. They go into a bonded warehouse and are re-shipped without payment of any duty. But, instead of going to New Caledonia or to the islands, or to whatever place they are shipped to, they are taken away to some part of the Commonwealth, for instance, to Northern Queensland or to Western Australia. To deal with such cases this reserve power is given. If it is found that there has been smuggling going on, and that a particular person has been identified with that smuggling, it is within the power of the Customhouse official to say to him, if he has been connected with the goods - "We wish to have a certificate from you that the goods have been disposed of in accordance with your export entry." </para>

                        <para>- It is in force in New Zealand for the very same reason as it is required in the Commonwealth. New Zealand is an island, with Australia not very far off, and it would be perfectly easy for a ship to clear from New Zealand for Australia, and to run back to that colony after a while and smuggle in the goods. So here, where Australia is one fiscal area, it would be perfectly simple for a ship to clear for New Zealand or the islands, or some other place outside the jurisdiction, and to , come back and run the goods into some part of the Commonwealth. This power cannot touch or affect the honest trader. The very form of the clause shows that it is intended as a reserve power to be put in force only where Custom-house officials have reason to suspect that some smuggling, or illegal dealing with goods, Ls going on, and to enable them to trace it out if necessary, or, at all events, to enable them to treat as a marked man any one whom they find has been so engaged. I hope that the committee will regard this as one of those powers which are necessary for the protection of the revenue, which really cannot affect the honest trader, and which, following the very good precedent of New Zealand, ought to remain for the collection of the customs of Australia. </para>

                    (New South Wales). - The Minister has whittled away the value of the certificate. He says that there is no difficulty in giving a certificate. If anybody can give a certificate, as he says, what is the good of the clause, unless there is some proof required in support of it? If there is no means of punishing the person who gives a false certificate, what is the good of the provision ? I submit that, according to his own explanation, it is of very little value.

                        <para>- No; all the man has to do is to give a false certificate, and then the clause is no good at all. Does that not show how the value of the clause is being whittled down? If a man is going to defraud the Customs in the way which is contemplated, is he likely to make much trouble or difficulty in giving a certificate that his goods have been landed in the proper way ? If the Customs officials require proof of the landing of the goods, they have to go outside the Commonwealth and get it from people over whom we have no control, who can snap their fingers in our face. It shows how little value the clause is. It is not necessary to have any suspicion of fraud ; there is not even to be an allegation of fraud or any suspected case of fraud. How much better it will be, if the clause is to remain, to place this power in the hands of only the comptroller. As he has the right to delegate any authority to a collector or other official, it would get over the difficulty of the power being possibly acted upon by any Customs officer. </para>

                    <para>- Some time ago I asked a question about papers presented in another place, and as to whether they could not be presented in the two Houses simultaneously. I understand that these papers have already been laid on the table of another place. It is only fair that all papers shall be presented simultaneously, so that we may know exactly what we are doing in connexion with debates that arise. </para>

                        <para>- Some time ago instructions were given that papers should be simultaneously laid on the table of both Houses, and I understood that that was being done. But it appears that there has been some mistake about the matter. I can assure the Senate that my honorable and learned friend the Postma"sterGeneral and I have put matters in train for insuring that in all cases papers shall be laid simultaneously upon the table of both Houses. There may be a difficulty in cases where there is a heavy bundle of documents which have not been previously printed, and it may be necessary to have them formally sent from one Chamber to another. But where it is possible there will be a simultaneous 'laying on the table Of both Houses of papers, so that the first intimation that documents have been presented shall be from the papers themselves, and not from any outside source. </para>
