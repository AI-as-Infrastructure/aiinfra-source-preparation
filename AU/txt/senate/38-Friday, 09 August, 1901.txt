                        <para>- During my unavoidable absence last week, through illness, a question of which I had given notice lapsed, but the Postmaster-General has been courteous enough to say that he has the answer to the question, which was to call the attention of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to the pressing necessity for the appointment of a committee of public accounts, and to ask if it is the intention of the Government to appoint such committee. </para>

                        <para>- (1) Whether they will be considered as permanent employes must depend upon the suitability and the conditions under which they were employed, as such conditions vary in the different States. (2) The instrument fitters temporarily employed in the General Post-office, Melbourne, have been employed under the regulations of the Public Service Board of Victoria, which precludes their employment for more than nine months at a time. </para>

                        <para>- It is not a fact as stated. The facts are that in reply to a telegram the Deputy Postmaster-General of Western Australia was informed on the 15th July that it had been approved that Monday and Tuesday, the 22nd and 23rd July, were to be observed as partial holidays in Perth and its vicinity in accordance with the practice of other States. Upon receiving such intimation, the Deputy Postmaster-General issued instructions that on Monday all telegraph offices were to be opened between the hours of S.30 and 10 a.m., and 6 and 7 p.m. On Tuesday the same arrangements were made, except that the offices at Perth, Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Boulder, Fremantle, Eucla, and Broome were kept open until noon instead of 10 a.m. </para>

                        <para>- It will be better for individual States to take action, or for five out of six to pitas laws bringing their legislation on this subject into line with that of Victoria, rather than to have one State refusing to delegate the power to the Commonwealth Parliament, and consequently have nothing done in that direction: I see no harm in the motion being carried in the form in which it is proposed, because it will stand simply as an invitation, I take it, to the Parliaments of the various States, if they choose to do so, to delegate this power under the Constitution to the Federal Parliament. I should hope then that within a reasonable time at all events, the Federal Parliament will deal with the matter. For the reasons I have given, I cannot see how it is possible even to hope that the Federal Parliament would be able to deal with this question within the present session. </para>

                    <para>- I know we have not the power yet, but I am pointing out that the process by which the honorable senator desires to achieve his end could not be successful within this session; and perhaps may take a considerably longer time, whereas the Parliaments of the individual States are at liberty at once to pass- such legislation. In that way we should be achieving a good result, in some of the States at least, with the hope that ultimately the legislation of all on the subject would be brought into line. I am not disposed to offer any opposition to the motion, because it will not have any injurious effect that I can see, and possibly, by ventilating the matter and bringing it under the notice of the State Parliaments, it may have beneficial results-. </para>

                    <para>- The only doubt I have is whether the motion will have any effect at all. The truth is that we have under the Constitution Act given the invitation that is contained in this motion, because under sub-section (37) of section 51, it is provided that the Commonwealth Parliament is to have power to deal with subjects which are sent to it by all the States or by some of the States, with the limitation that in the event of it being only some of the States the laws we shall make shall only relate to those States. Under that sub-section we have at once given authority to the Commonwealth Parliament to act when the subject matter is referred to it, and we have given the invitation to the States to pass the necessary legislation to enable the Commonwealth Parliament to act. It therefore appears to me useless to pass this motion, because we are bound to accept this power to legislate in this way, if it be sent to us. That sub-section is our authority, and we are, subject to this Constitution, to have power to make laws. </para>

                        <para>- Then we have power to make laws. It appears to me that the power argues the necessity of exercising it. If jurisdiction is committed to us in respect of certain matters, we have to exercise it at some time or other. It is put merely as an authority to make laws, but m substance it is a mandate to make laws, dealing with the subjects referred to us. I have not the least objection to. the motion, and am only -suggesting to the honorable senator whether it is necessary to pass a motion which is in effect only a repetition of the Constitution, excepting that it will only have the authority of -this House which passes the resolution, and will not have the authority of the whole Legislature, as of course the Constitution Act has. </para>

                        <para>- It is practically the same thing. A Judge acts as chairman of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court there, and I am bound to say that the evidence is far better sifted and analyzed, and the decisions are far more equitable to both sides than in many cases in Victoria. It does appear a very grave fault that our wages boards can be .constituted as some of them are, and that a chairman can be appointed who, although he may be in many cases a most estimable man - a minister of religion, perhaps, and generally anxious to do the very best - knows nothing whatever of the matters submitted to him. I do not think we can expect anything like good practical results from such a state of things. I shall be personally very glad to do all I can to assist in the passing* of Commonwealth legislation upon this subject. Until we have uniform legislation there must necessarily be throat-cutting going on between the various States in determining who shall command the manufacturing power. Undoubtedly' in that conflict wages must suffer. I have never )'et been a believer in the reduction of wages below a reasonable standard. I believe in getting good men, and paying them well, even upon the ground of self interest, and any legislation that will have for its object the abolition of the deplorable system of sweating which has been in existence for many years in several States, and exists now in some, will have my most hearty support. Therefore, while I -fear that the motion will not have much practical result, I shall still be prepared to support it ; but I would strongly urge those honorable senators who, like myself, feel an interest in this matter, not to be content with passing the motion, but to work outside, and endeavour to get the State Parliaments to take prompt action in the matter. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that. Then, in sub-section (39), additional power is given to legislate with respect to matters that govern the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth. If we have power to regulate trade and commerce between other countries and the States of the Commonwealth, and if sweating in one State influences trade and commerce in relation to another State, then we have the incidental powers under subsection (39) which enable us to deal with it. It is as to this point I should like to have a legal opinion - the opinions of those who framed the Constitution and know" what they meant themselves. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has not yet spoken. He was at the Convention and ought to know, but when those honorable senators who were in the Convention do give us some explanation of the matter I hope they will not be at variance, as they have been in connexion with other constitutional questions in the past. </para>

                        <para>- A practical man is the man who ought to preside over a wages board. Surely amongst practical men, familiar with the working of trade and industry, we can get men with the judicial habit of mind, who will be as free from the possibility of bias, and as able to weigh with a stern disregard of sentiment and emotion the interests of two contending parties, as we can get by taking a Judge from the bench. We are importing Judges into too many affairs of every-day life. The more we keep them aloof, from not only social matters but details of trade matters, the better for the ultimate and higher administration of justice. It. is an erroneous line of thought that we cannot get our trade affairs administered and trade disputes settled without bringing down a Judge from the bench in order to introduce impartiality. I feel that we can get impartiality and knowledge without the necessity of doing that, and I should be sorry if wages boards, or boards of that description, should have recourse to the services of the Judges of the higher courts for the purpose of having their business conducted. I trust, whatever steps are taken in this direction, that alteration will not be given effect to. It would be well, also, if we could abstain from having Judges presiding over conciliation and arbitration boards, because I believe they can accomplish their object better without them. </para>

On the other hand, has my honorable friend considered whether it may suggest to the State Parliaments that we want to arrogate to ourselves powers which they prefer to exercise themselves1! They are sensitive, because I see they are passing resolutions of condemnation upon us for 'extravagance - justly, I think, in some respects - and they may say - "The Federal Parliament, not satisfied with the enormous powers which have been withdrawn from the States, .are intimating to us that they want us to hand over something else." </para>

                    <para>- I am glad to see the unanimity that has been expressed with respect .to this motion. I think that honorable senators -will agree with me, when I say that at the present moment we are face to face with an industrial crisis in Victoria. We have to recognise that a dislocation of our industrial conditions has been brought about by the inauguration of federation. This is part of the price that the industrial classes have to pay, for the time being at any rate, for federation. Yet at the same time, I say without the slightest hesitation that the factory legislation of Victoria has been a great success. Possibly, with the peculiar conditions that are facing us to-day, it may require a little time to bring about the desired result, but I have faith enough to believe that notwithstanding the opposition that has been shown to the Victorian factory law, not only in this State, but in other States of the Commonwealth, in a short time that opposition will be overcome and uniform factory legislation will prevail throughout the whole of Australia. Another place has also passed a similar resolution to the one before the </para>

                        <para>- It is a quicker way and it isa more satisfactory way, and one great advantage is that unless there is dissatisfaction existing between the employer and the employe, the court is not put into operation. It seems to me that under the Factories Act in Victoria, in some cases the wages boards step in where there is no great desire on either side for any interference by them. Under the system of arbitration for fixing wages, dissatisfaction has first to exist before the arbitration court can do its work, Here I would say also that an arbitration court is superior to a wages board, because under the arbitration court proceedings we have the case for the employer and the case for the employe put and argued by those directly interested in the dispute, and having a direct knowledge of the conditions under which the work is carried on. We have one employÃ©, who, though he may not be a member of the particular trade in which the dispute has arisen, knows what it is to work for wages and to live under similar conditions. We have, on the other hand, an employer, who knows what it is to employ men and to bear the brunt of severe competition; and we have a third man with a judicial mind, who cannot be influenced by either party, and has no bias to either party, and will give a decision upon the evidence which has come before him. That would bea board far superior to the ordinary wages board under the Factories Act in Victoria. For these reasons I believe that an Arbitration Act would be far better for both employers and employes, and would be more just in its action towards those engaged in commerce and the workers of Australia generally, than would be the operations of these wages boards if extended as might seem to be indicated under this motion. I intend, however, to vote for the motion for the reason that it will draw the attention of the State Governments to the necessity for some such legislation as this. I do not think they will willingly hand over to the Federal Parliament the power of making these laws. I believe they will desire to retain the power, and I vote for the motion believing that by drawing their attention to the matter and having it discussed by the State Parliaments action of some sort may be taken by them to pass improved factory legislation. Listening to the debate, one cannot help thinking that no sooner are some of these industries which have been assisted by a protectionist Tariff called upon to bear fair competition, and exist under fair conditions, than at once the outcry goes forth that this legislation is restrictive. I have listened with some surprise to manufacturers in the States asking that they may be assisted by protection through the Customs, and asking us to use our influence and our vote to continue the protection they have had in the past; while, almost in the same breath, they are asking us to vote against any legislation which comes before Parliament in the direction of interfering in any of the transactions between themselves and their employes. That is a most inconsistent position for them to take up. If, as they say, they cannot be trammelled by this legislation, and cannot be trammelled by an Arbitration Act, but must be free to deal with their employes as they like, it will be for this Senate seriously to consider whether we should continue to extend to them those privileges they have enjoyed in the past through the Customs-house. For the reasons I have given I intend to vote for the motion, believing that, if carried, the State Parliaments will not hand over the power of framing this legislation to the Commonwealth, but will see that it can be more effectively dealt with by themselves. </para>

                        <para>- It therefore appears to me absolutely impossible to conceive that the other States will for one moment do anything which will enable tins Parliament to fetter them in the slightest degree with industrial legislation, which may cause to them the embarrassment which Victoria is feeling now. I sympathize greatly with the workmen of Victoria, because they have, through their trades and labour councils and through their representatives, practically compelled the Parliament of this State to pass an advanced Factories Act. I am afraid that under it the wages boards have gone too far, and taken too much power upon themselves, and the workman finds that an Act passed for his benefit is likely to end disastrously to him. </para>

                        <para>- No ;I think that it is right for employers to have a union to protect themselves and their industries, and for the employÃ©s to have the same. What we want to do is to be fair to both parties. I am not going to oppose the motion; but I am not particularly anxious to vote for it, because it may thus appear to Tasmania that I think the Legislature of that State should refer this matter to the Commonwealth Parliament. I do not think anything of the kind. I am not even inclined to believe that they will do so. I think that they would rather retain their industrial freedom and allow each State to work out its own industrial life on its own terms, and having regard to its own conditions. </para>

                    <para>- In reading this motion I was rather at a loss to know why the honorable senator responsible for it, instead of bringing the matter up here, had not stirred up his fellow workers and the members of the State Parliaments to agitate for the initial tion of the motion in the State Legislatures. Knowing that the Constitution clearly sets forth that the Federal Parliament can deal with such matters as may be referred to it from the States, I thought it would be well for the labour party in every State Parliament to agitate there that this question be referred to this Parliament, if they think that a question of industrial legislation could be better dealt with here than there. I do not think that the State Parliaments will surrender their power in this matter. In South Australia last year we passed an Act very similar to the Act of Parliament of Victoria, and a great many of our manufacturers regretted that in the Commonwealth the factories law would not be uniform; that New South Wales, and perhaps Tasmania, Western Australia, or Queensland, not having the same restrictive factory legislation as we in South Australia had, would be placed at some advantage, and they urged that uniform factory legislation ought to be passed. But, notwithstanding their wish in that respect, I failed then to see how we could induce the States to hand over to the Federal Parliament the powers which they hold. It seems that after all the State Parliaments would be in a position to deal with the matter far better than the Federal Parliament could, because the legislation then would be in conformity with the conditions of the State. If we attempted to fix the rate of wages for the whole of Australia we should be committing a very great mistake because the conditions are vastly different in this great island continent. For instance on the mines in Western Australia, I presume the men would expect higher wages than they would expect in the Wallaroo mines. </para>

                        <para>.- That is so; but I do not wish to discuss this question from the point of view of free-trade or protection. The workers of the different States have shown no anxiety to obtain uniform factory laws from the Federal Parliament, and their representatives in the State Parliaments are not likely to throw aside the power they now have in this respect at the instance of this Senate. At the election for the members of the Senate in New South Wales, no successful candidate polled less than 70,000 votes, but the total number polled by the labour candidate highest on the poll was, I think, only between 2S,000 and 29,000. That showed clearly that the workers of New South Wales were not anxious to have direct representation in the Senate. They evidently preferred to keep labour matters in their own power. If in the local Legislatures the special representatives of labour have not taken up this question - if it is not in the platform of the labour party of the State from which I come - it is not likely that they are going to throw aside their power of dealing with labour legislation by agreeing to this proposal, even if the Senate carries it. </para>

                        <para>.- The advantages that would flow from the development of our local resources, with the larger markets of the rest of the States thrown open to us. For the last twenty years every State in Australia has put up barriers against New South Wales. The State in which we are speaking imposed a stock tax to get at New South Wales and Queensland, and my honorable friends from Queensland know that the result has been that their live stock has been kept out of Victorian markets. We expect, as the result of, federation, that all those barriers will be removed. I have said sufficient without going into other details to express my belief that the motion is not in accordance with the views of the majority of the people of the State I represent. Without any kind of unfriendliness either to the mover of the motion or the object he has in view, I do not see my way to support it, though from a humanitarian stand-point I should be quite willing to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly so. I can say honestly that I have no sympathy whatever with sweating. I believe in paying good wages for good work. But. this minimum wage promises in some cases to become a. maximum wage, and men will not pay more than that wage. If I were a mechanic I should like to be left perfectly independent to make my own bargain, and go where I could get the best wages. I do not think I should care to have to submit to7s. per day because others were willing to take it. </para>

                        <para>- I am not so sure. I think unionists are quite right, provided they do not interfere with the liberty of persons outside their union. I do not object to the unions if they permitted the same liberty to persons outside their ranks. </para>

                        <para>- It appears so to me. When any one has worked hard and got together a little he seems to be looked upon as an enemy of the workman. I would remind the honorable senator that Henry George distinctly gives as his definition of capital, that it is "stored up labour." A labourer lives within his means, and puts by a little capital every year, and really employers and labourers should work harmoniously together, for the employer of to-day may be the labourer of to-morrow. </para>

The relative share of wealth which goes to the capitalist and to the labourer in Australia is not 'so clearly defined as it is in the United Kingdom. We find in the United Kingdom that out of every Â£1 the working classes receive 6s. 8d., whilst the capitalistic classes get 13s. 4d. The division may be a little more equitable here, but it is not by any means so nearly equal as it ought to be, and the more equal division is what is aimed at by legislation of this character. </para>

I believe that all the affairs of the community could be much better earned on under a system of collectivism than they are at present ; but while I believe in that as I believe in heaven - as something far off but tangible - I think that, in the meantime, we can do something to better the conditions in which we are at present living and working, and this motion, it appears to me, is in that direction. As I was trying to point out, when interrupted just now, if all the Continental States passed factory legislation on the lines of Victoria, and Tasmania stood out, the result would be that the Continental States would be compelled to abandon their legislation, and they would be reduced to the level of Tasmania. I can quite understand our freetrade friends from New South Wales being so much opposed to this motion, because according to their doctrine they want to buy everything in the cheapest market. </para>

                        <para>- I do not for a moment imagine that the wages would be the same in Rockhampton as in Hobart. I can easily conceive that a man might be willing to work in Hobart for a lower rate of wages than in Rockhampton; in the first place because the climate in the north is not so agreeable, and in the second place because the cost of living there is higher. But then my honorable friend must remember that the bootmaker's market in Rockhampton would probably be limited to Rockhampton and the central district generally, and he would have the protection of distance as against Hobart. These matters, I think, will always fit themselves in to local conditions. Some honorable senators seem to be afraid that the States will resent a motion of this kind being passed by each House of this Parliament. It is not my intention, and I do not believe it was the intention of the mover in another place, to injure the feelings of the States in any way. All we desire to bring before the States is that it is necessary, unless cut-throat competition is to be resorted to all over the continent, that some uniform taxing legislation should be passed. If the State Governments consider that they are better qualified to deal with the question than we are, they will keep the power in their own hands, but I believe, even if they come to that conclusion experience will teach them, as it has taught the advocates of voluntary early closing, that nothing short of the long arm of the Commonwealth Parliament will be able to reach those who refuse to legislate up to the standard which some of these States have set. I believe that the power should be referred to the Commonwealth Parliament, because it is the only legislative body which has within itself the capacity to deal in a large, comprehensive, and final way with a question which closely affects the industrial life of the entire continent. I hope that the motion will be passed without dissent. </para>

                            <para>- It is if the honorable senator is going to be bound by precedent. But I submit that I have given good reasons why this legal reciprocity is a right and natural tiling to bring about. As mr motion says, it is in the interests of the suitor, and it is surely a full and natural development of the union into which these States have entered. There is another reason why I think the legal practitioners of One State ought to be permitted to practise in another State. It appears to me that at the rate we are going, we shall live nine months out of the twelve, certainly six months out of the twelve, in the city of Melbourne - and a very nice city it is. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps the honorable and learned senator will deal with it in reply. I do not intend to go into details upon the motion. There is one portion of the motion to which I would draw attention, and that is the proposal that a message should be sent to the House of Representatives acquainting them with this resolution, and requesting their concurrence therein. No doubt this is a resolution which we hope will have some effect and influence upon the Governments of the different States to which it is addressed, but I do not think it can be said that the subject is of sufficient importance to justify our requesting the concurrence of the House of Representatives in a resolution of this kind.- It seems to me that if an expression of our opinion, coming from this House with the power and influence which that will involve, is communicated to the Governments of the States, it will be sufficient to carry out the purpose my honorable and learned friend has in view, and I think it would perhaps be making a little too much of the subject to request the concurrence of the other House in the resolution. I suggest to my honorable and learned friend that it would be better to omit the second portion of the motion, and that would not take away from its effectiveness. We must be careful about making precedents of this kind. We will pass many resolutions, I hope, in which we will make suggestions to the States for carrying out legislation consequent upon federation, but unless in extremely important matters, 1 think it is not wise that we should ask the concurrence of the House of Representatives in such resolutions. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose every one in the House agrees with the sentiment of the motion. We want, as the leader of the House very well put it just now, the largest possible area of selection in every department of labour, whether it is professional or otherwise. But the difficulty I feel about matters of this kind, and more even about this than about the motion which we discussed just now, is this : Ought we to pass resolutions about matters which are not within our jurisdiction ? If this measure is not within the Commonwealth powers, ought we to try to bring pressure to Dear upon the States by passing a resolution to which we are absolutely unable to give any effect? Are we to be a persuasive authority, to pass sentimental, and not legislative resolutions, from time to time, which we are to send to the Parliaments of the different States, requesting them to pass legislation upon a matter which is entirely within their control, and with which we have nothing in the world to do? We have got to be very careful in keeping up the proper relation between the Commonwealth and the States. I dare say we would not be very pleased if we were to receive resolutions from the States - and I clare say we will receive them from the States - instructing us what we ought to do respecting matters exclusively within our own control, and with which they have nothing to do. </para>

                            <para>- An Act of Parliament is much stronger than a resolution. The profession in Victoria is legally amalgamated but actually separated, and if an Act of Parliament has not been potent enough to do what every one considers an Act of Parliament can- do, what result can there be from a resolution of the Senate which is not an Act of Parliament and is passed without any authority at all.? Although I do not intend to oppose this motion, 1 do venture, with great humility and with great respect, to suggest to my honorable and learned friend and to other honorable senators that we have quite enough to do when acting within our rights, without indulging in sentimental considerations, beyond our powers, which mean nothing, which might annoy the States, which can do no good, and which might prevent the good feeling with which we intended the Commonwealth, under God, to be inaugurated. I deprecate very much resolutions of this kind, which are founded on the. very ground that they are not within our powers, and are put forward as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the States in respect of matters with which the Commonwealth has nothing to do, but which are strictly within the rights of the States themselves. </para>

                            <para>- It is with some diffidence, being a nonlegal member, that I rise to say a few words on this subject. It has only recently come within my knowledge that the legal profession in Victoria are more strict in regard to the admission of lawyers from the old country to their ranks than the New South Wales bar. A young man. came out from the old country the other day with a letter of introduction addressed to a member of the Senate. He was a. Writer to the Signet in Scotland, but the gentleman to whom he carried the letter of introduction was obliged to send him on to Sydney, because he could not be admitted to the Victorian bar. He will be admitted at once in New South Wales as a Writer to the Signet. I know of a case which occurred in Queensland in which a gentleman, who was afterwards Registrar-General, and who was an S.S.C. - that is to say, a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Scotland - could not be admitted to practise there because he was not a Writer to the Signet. In law, as in all other things, I am an advocate of free-trade. I- hope- we shall be able to attract a great many of our rising young lawyers to Australia from the old country, and to do something to strengthen that European immigration, -which I hope to see encouraged just as it was in Queensland in years gone by. I agree with the leader of the Senate that as this is the States House there- is no necessity for the second part of the motion. </para>

                            <para>- I may be wrong in that particular, but I do not think I am because I rÃ©ad the report very carefully. In most cases it gives the contribution by the employers, the employes, and the State, and it makes the comment, that the contribution by the State is continually increasing. Whether it referred to the invalidity fund or the accident fund I do not know, but it says that while greater claims were being made on the invalidity or accident fund, the demands on the old-age pension fund were becoming less. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps I did the honorable senator an injustice in contradicting him. The contribution from the State which he refers to in respect to accident insurance will be, now that I come to think of it, the amounts paid, as stated by me, by the Government for the industrial accident insurance of State employes. The honorable senator is no doubt quite right. The figures he refers to deal with the amount paid by the Government for the insurance of their own employes, the State not contributing to the general fund in respect of persons in private employ. </para>

                        <para>If Victoria legislated in respect of insurance, that would be State insurance. If Victoria legislated in respect of insurance that not only referred to Victoria but to other States as well, that would be going beyond State insurance ; and, although the action of Victoria would not come within the purview of this motion so far as her State insurance was concerned, it would as far as any endeavour was mode to extend any State auspices to States other than her own. Therefore the Commonwealth Act puts the matter very plainly - </para>
                        <para>Insurance other than State insurance. </para>
                        <para>So that if it is State insurance, we have nothing to do with it. The Commonwealth Act also says - </para>
                        <para>Also State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned. </para>
                        <para>Insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned- and the Commonwealth has power to deal with it. There is the whole question. I have heard doubts expressed as to whether the effect of those provisions of the Constitution Act might not be that the Commonwealth has power to legislate unless a State has passed laws with regard to State insurance. That is, it is a "firstcome first - served " sort of thing. It means that if a State is first in effecting Government insurance, it has a right to do so; but if the Commonwealth is first, we have the right. It is perfectly clear, however, that the Constitution means nothing of the kind. Whenever it comes to be a question of State insurance, the Commonwealth has no jurisdiction. " State insurance " is a well defined term. It means insurance by a particular State. The Commonwealth cannot pass any insurance law in respect of a particular State. The Commonwealth can only pass legislation respecting insurance if State legislation affecting insurance extends beyond the limits of the State concerned. In other words, as I said on the point of order, the Commonwealth has only jurisdiction in the case of an overlap. If we were to pass this motion, it would be like the other motion we have passed to-day, and would have no possible effect. In fact, it would have rather less effect than in the other case. It would be absolutely a provision we have no power of carrying out, and would be almost an illegal provision. But as, putting it in the mildest way, it would be absolutely useless, I venture to oppose the resolution. It is utterly useless for us to carry a resolution which is directly against the very words of the Constitution, because the Constitution says that, as far as State insurance is concerned, we have no power to interfere with it. </para>
