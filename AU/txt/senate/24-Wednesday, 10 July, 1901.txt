                Sir FREDERICK SARGOOD. I have received a number of telegrams and letters to the same effect, but I do not know what I can do with them. They are not petitions.

                    <para>. - Before the committee proceed with the discussion of the amendment, I should like to make a remark with regard to the amendments which have been suggested in some of the clauses. I do not know how much progress the committee will make this evening, but I hope we shall make very substantial progress. I shall be obliged if honorable senators who desire that clauses shall be recommitted will remind me of them, because in many cases where it has been suggested that a clause should be recommitted subsequent discussion has shown that no alteration is necessary. The only clauses I have noted for recommittal are clauses 2 and 5. </para>

They have been doing this work for the last 60 years. I would now direct the attention of the committee to matters relating to this question so far as our own country is concerned. It appears that at the postal conference held at Wellington, prior to 1895, a motion was moved and passed, I think, that it should be represented to the British Government that the Australian colonies preferred to have their mails carried by ships which employed entirely white labour. Following upon that determination a resolution was carried at the postal conference held in Hobart, in 1895, that it be a condition in any future contracts that, mail steamers should be manned by white labour only. Another resolution was passed by that conference in which the following words occur - </para>

                    Thynne's words were prophetic, because we know that since then we have received a snub from the Imperial authorities, inasmuch as recently one of our State Acts, which contained a clause something like
                    Glassey's  amendment, was not assented to on the ground that the persons it referred to were British subjects, and that we must give a British subject that fair and generous treatment which we, as British subjects, claim for ourselves. Coming to the present time, let me remind.
                    that to some people - and I am one of them - it appears to savour rather of cant and insincerity to ask the Senate to pass this amendment.

But when we want civilized conditions men cannot work for the wages for which these coloured people will work. If all the steamship companies on the face of the earth were to come here and take an oath oran affirmation that the coolie is not cheaper than the white man, I would not believe them, because there are plenty of white men to do their work, and consequently that" Abatement cannot be true, and I say it is not true.

                        <para>- Our great merit is, that the Anglo-Saxon race is made up - like the English tongue - -of contributions from all the peoples of Christendom. The Anglo-Saxon race enjoys its strength and its enterprise by reason of the mingling of all the blood of Europe, and, therefore, these arguments really are, I think, beside the question. Nor does it seem to me - I wish to dispose of them before I say a few words on the amendment - to affect the matter. Then, we are told that white sailors, or, as my honorable friend put it, our own people are displaced. I find no authority for that statement. I defy any one here to prove by statistics of the seamen employed in the mercantile marine, or, for the matter of that, in the navy of the British Empire, that our own people, to use my honorable friend's excellent phrase, are shut out. What has been the great cry for decades past? It is that we cannot get enough English seamen to man the mercantile marine. AVe have got men from every nationality in Europe, and we are obliged to do it. </para>

I do not understand the attitude of the Government. More than that, nothing, it seems to me, could be more unconstitutional than amendment, and we will carry out the policy as though the provision were in the Bill." </para>

I should prefer, if that is the policy of the Government, that it should be clearly stated in the forefront of an Act of Parliament, so that all our people might know what is being done, and all the nations of the earth might be aware of it. " That is the position in which it seems to me the matter should be placed. There are, however, other reasons why this amendment should not be accepted.

                    [10 July, 1901.]
                    must define what he means by "white" men. Then, again, is it to be limited to men of our own blood, or are foreigners to be included, who in time of war may be a source of the greatest possible danger to us ? Are they to be " white " to the extent of being albinos
                    What are they to be ? For all these reasons I ask my honorable friend to withdraw his amendment and reconsider it. It will be unworkable if left in its present state, and it would certainly have the effect, as
                    has pointed out, of unfairly harassing the Postmaster-General in the administration of his department. Then, again, it has been pointed out, that we cannot control the arrangements and the managing of the ships, which carry our mails. If these lascar sailors are unequal to British seamen, or if their employment involve the companies in greater difficulties, that is a question for them to determine, not for us. At any rate, we have no right by compulsion to seek to interfere with the management of the Postal department, which might be driven if this amendment were introduced into the Bill to refuse to enter into contracts with ships flying the British flag, and to intrust the carriage of mails to foreign vessels. Such a state of things, I venture to think, would not be tolerated by this Senate. While at present we put our mails on board French and German ships, I fancy that the people of Australia would pause before they assented to anything which would make it compulsory that all our mails should be carried by ships flying foreign flags, much as we respect the nations to which those vessels belong.

                    <para>- I have acted as agent for one of the mail companies for many years, and I have been a shipping agent all my life. It is urged that it is unfair to employ coloured labour on vessels under the postal contracts because other companies object to it. I can only say that I have never heard of am' such .objection. Other firms have never complained of the Peninsular and Oriental Company employing coloured labour, and, before any drastic steps are taken, we should be careful that no injustice is done.. As far as firemen and stokers are concerned, there is the greatest difficulty in getting British men to do such work. It is not a. question of wages. It is simply a question of getting the men. </para>

                        <para>- Many of the warships employ coloured firemen. I am quite unpledged with regard to the policy of a white Australia, and I contend that tropical labour in the tropics ought to be done by tropical men.' We can get white men to do anything for money, but when honorable senators see firemen, as I have seen them, coming ashore at Hobart or at Melbourne after a voyage, and rushing into a public-house and often being left behind, they will understand what this work is. </para>

                        <para>- That is all the more reason why we should not embarrass the passage of the Bill by introducing tins policy into it. With regard to the question of whether white men can do the work coloured crews can perform, I, as a marine engineer, with experience of white and Chinese crews, can speak with some ' authority. I say that white men can work where coloured men can work. I do not believe it is a question of cheapness on the part of the companies who have adopted 'this system. Nor do I believe that they have adopted it because they desire to use their employe's just as they like. My experience is that we, as officers on board ship, have had more restrictions placed upon us in our treatment of the Chinese than we have had in regard to men of our own race. </para>

                        <para>- With the Orient Company employing white crews, and the Peninsular and Oriental Company employing lascars, there can be no philanthropic sentiment in it at all. It is a question of which crew they can work to the best advantage for themselves. If it were a question of cheapness, how could the Orient Company afford to pay for white crews, while the Peninsular and Oriental Company only pay for coloured men ? Is it to be supposed that the former is prepared to pay something for a sentiment ? Sentiment does not enter into commercial calculations. In my opinion it is more a question of convenience than anything else. </para>

                        <para>- No, I do not desire to do so. I have held all through that it is the trades union influence upon these men which has led to a better class being secured. Where an officer or an engineer has an organized body of men with a secretary to deal with, he knows that a man who is unworthy of a position in the ship, who is guilty of drunkenness and disobedience of orders can practically be boycotted. Such a man can be practically wiped out of the service. That I attribute to the influence of trades unionism. T think that to-day in many of our firemen and sailors we have a much better class of men than we had a generation ago. </para>

                        <para>- We do that in order, not that we may get an immediate return, but that we may benefit a certain industry by seeking to permanently establish it. But when we stipulate with our mail-carriers to carry our mails; they say that if they are asked to carry them at a certain speed, they will have to demand a higher rate of payment than it would be necessary for them to demand if they might carry the mails at a lower speed. If we earned out the policy proposed, we would find that the Postmaster-General would be unable to avail himself of any opportunity to utilize any ships which might have any coloured men in their crews at all, for the despatch of our mails. We have now a line of Japanese boats trading to Australia, and the Postmaster-General might find it convenient to engage them to carry mails to and from their own country. Under this amendment such a contract would be forbidden. </para>

                        <para>- I have had experience of different races, and while no ' man favours his own race more than I do, I do not believe in imposing restrictions which would prevent our having our work well done for us. I believe that tins amendment would prevent our work being well done if it were carried. I know very well that there are to-day combinations of steam-ship owners that are very oppressive upon the producers of this country. Steam-ship companies have entered into strong unions and have raised freights enormously, and that is having a very depressing and injurious effect upon our industries. I say that if we are to interfere, it would be far better to say that we would not allow our mails to be carried by companies who have entered into combinations, to force up freights to an abnormal figure. </para>

The Government might give full effect to the amendment even though there were on board a ship a few waiters whose colour might not be above reproach, and who might be Eurasians from India, or half-bred Chinamen or Japanese. The employment of those men would not vitiate the contract so long as the rest of the crew was white. </para>

                    Heseemed to be under the impression that the commission which inquired into the black labour question in Queensland adopted a majority report against the employment of black labour. The facts are just the other way about. The majority of the commission, were in favour of the continuance of the employment of black labour, but a minority,, including the
                    H. Groom, who is now a member of the House of Representatives, were in favour of substituting white labour. The opinion of the majority of the commission was that in places above a certain parallel of latitude black labour should be permitted to be employed. I. have no doubt that in his speech in reply
                    will give the committee the exact facts, because he knows them very well. I have always been under the impression that the British Empire was a cosmopolitan empire. AVe are part of that empire, and I cannot conceive' it to be otherwise than inconsistent that we should not be cosmopolitan. For that reason alone I shall oppose the amendment. Irrespective of that, there would be a great deal of difficulty in giving effect to it if carried. In'Australia there are a number of Eurasians who have children born in the States. Are those children to be excluded from the crews of ships which cany our mails
                    In New Zealand there are half-caste  Maories.  Are they to be excluded
                    It is absolutely impossible . from my point of view to give' effect to the amendment literally.
                    in his speech in favour of the amendment, has practically given himself away. He has tried to make out that the cook and the waiters are not part of the crew of the vessel. If the supporters of- the amendment are consistent, not a single: black or coloured waiter or cook ought to be employed in a ship carrying mails. I .am sure
                    will agree with me in that.

                        <para>- I cannot take a small view of this question. I cannot forget what has taken place in the past ; the developments which are taking place in regard to various Asiatic powers, the growing power of the coloured races. If we look forward to the possibilities of the future, we shall hesitate very much indeed, if we want to do what is best for Australia and the Empire, before we put upon our statute-book a provision which carries with it a great insult to one half of the world's inhabitants. It has been for a long time past the boast of Great Britain that she is more or less of an Asiatic power, and that her presence in Asia has done a great deal to develop India and the contiguous countries. She has brought peace to them. There has been an increase of wealth, and the natives of India and of Asia generally are in a better position than they were at the beginning of the last century. They recognise that they enjoy greater privileges and greater blessings under the British flag than they possessed in years gone by. Having regard to the expansion which is taking place in China and Japan, and the certainty of greater development in the future, it is not for us when we do not know what the coming years will bring about, and when we do know that it is desirable for us to have the friendship of a country like Japan, to put upon our statute-book a piece of legislation which they would look upon as an affront and an insult. I want the distinction between legislation such as this, and such as is required to carry out the idea involved in the principle of a white Australia, to be clearly seen. I am an advocate of the policy of a white Australia. I recognise that evil has resulted in America from the mixture of white and coloured races. We ' require to keep the races in Australia distinct. We desire to keep the races in Australia white, and we must not admit coloured races in any indiscriminate manner. .1 do not propose to admit them at all. All coloured labour should be kept out of Australia. But keeping coloured labour out of Australia is one thing, and trying to keep coloured labour out of British ships on the high seas is quite a different matter. It is a difference which I think we shall do well to understand. I have pledged myself in favour of a white Australia in the sense in which I am referring to it, but most decidedly I will do everything in my power to prevent that policy being extended in a direction which was never contemplated. </para>

                        <para>- I will do all in my power to prevent the extension of this policy in a direction which could only bring discredit and disgrace on the British flag and lower the character of British communities, while at the same time causing enlightened nations, such as Japan is now, to entertain the feeling that Australia is a country which is to be looked upon with suspicion, and might possibly become an enemy. I trust therefore, that this amendment will be defeated by a very handsome majority. There are many other directions in which I might elaborate my objection to the amendment, but considering the length to which this debate has extended, I content myself with these few remarks, and by again expressing the earnest hope that the honour and fair play of the British Empire will be vindicated to-night by the defeat of this amendment. </para>

If it is against the interests of the British Empire to prohibit the employment of subjects of the" British Empire on British ships, surely it is against the interests of the British Empire in a much greater degree to put obstacles in the way of the employment on these ships of citizens of Australia, which is part of that empire. </para>

                        <para>- I wish those honorable senators who talk so much about drawing the line would only draw it. I wonder if they have ever looked the position they take up squarely in the face ? I am going to try and put it to them as. clearly as I can. The primary objection which has been taken by the opponents of this amendment is that in legislating, in this fashion we are "interfering with the inalienable rights of British subjects. They say that this amendment is aimed at the- Indian subjects of the Government, and that as these people are citizens of the British Empire just as much as we are, they are entitled to every right within the boundaries of the empire that we enjoy. Very well : but are honorable senators who argue in this way prepared to face that position in its entirety. If this contention is correct, then I say that the Indian coolie, in his thousands and tens of thousands, can come here and swamp the white workers of Australia.. Are the people of Australia prepared for that? </para>

                        <para>- I do not look upon the honorable senator who has just interjected as a watch-dog for a white Australia at all. I look upon him as one of those canines who is prepared to betray his trust for any little bone that is thrown to him. Are honorable senators prepared to face the position such as I have placed before them. If they are, we might as well at once abandon all talk of a white Australia. What is the good of talking about a white Australia if we have not a right to prevent the Hindoos and the coolies, and all the other alien subjects of the King from coming here? Have we that &gt; right or not ? If we have, then we can keep them out. If we have not, then we have no power to keep them out. I think we : should have some strong statement on the question- from honorable senators. who get up to discuss it. I have always been under the impression that this is a self-governing community. We have been told that we have supreme power in connexion with everything Australian, and that we are as much a self-governing community, as far as our interna] affairs are concerned, as the people of Great Britain themselves. </para>

The agreement that we make with a particular shipping company is that it will cany our letters to a particular part of the world, and from a particular port of the world, and we say to this company - " One condition of the contract we make with you. is that you shall only employ white crews." . Either we have a right to make such a condition or we have not. The Postmaster-General admits that we have the right, but he says that it would be injudicious, perhaps,' to put it into the Bill. We are assured, however, that the Government will take very good care that this very provision, which we ought not to put into the Bill, will be put -into the contracts. If the Government can put a condition of this kind into its contracts, why not put it into the Bill ? The Vice-President of the Executive Council says that if we inserted such . a provision in the Bill, the Imperial Government would probably refuse its assent. </para>

                    2245 coloured Asiatics. It is much more than a question merely of colour ; it is a question of wages. We heard a great deal this afternoon and on previous occasions about the British mercantile marine being manned by foreigners. How has it come about? Do honorable senators know the history of this question? Do they not know that the British seaman has been continual!)' agitating for the last 50 years for improved conditions ? Have they ever heard of a gentleman named Samuel Plimsoll, who for a very long series of years agitated for a load line ? Has it ever come within the range of their ken that British ships were for decade after decade nothing more nor less than floating coffins, and that the British seaman, seeing that he could not get good conditions, safe ships to sail in, and could not get decently paid for his work; seeing also that he was fed more like a dog than a man - all in the interest of commercialism, all in the interests of the beautiful policy so strongly advocate by Senators Pulsford and Walker of New South Wales.

                        <para>- Perhaps honorable senators will just permit me to say that those two honorable senators are doing more injury to the cause 'of free-trade than it is possible almost for any other two honorable senators to do, because if their principles were carried out to their logical conclusion, the result would be such as would make free-trade stink in the nostrils of every man who loves Australia. As I was saying, th reason why British seamen desert British ships as we are told rats leave a sinking ship, is because they were not decently paid or decently fed, and because the ships in many cases were mere floating coffins. They tried to get better conditions and they were refused. The British Parliament, with its reverence for free-trade principles, would not interfere with the sacred doctrine of supply and demand. Oh, - no, it would never do, and the consequence was that the British seaman looked out for other occupations, and took himself to other parts of the earth. He went over to America to help build up the splendid national edifice which we see over there to-day, and now we have men from every country in Europe manning British ships, whereas, if we had a decent protectionist policy in force, which protected the workmen as well as the capitalists, the ships of Britain to-day would be manned not by people from the </para>

                    2249 a moment that the British Government, if such an amendment were inserted in the Bill, would object to it. If they did object it would be time for the people of Australia to consider their position. I have no doubt that they would do so in the most effective way. But we are not here to anticipate such a difficulty. I am by' no means terrified or intimidated by the arguments which have been advanced upon this point. I do not believe the Royal assent to the Bill would be refused ; but even if it were, I should not be deterred in the slightest degree from pursuing the course which I believe to be the right one.

                        <para>- The honorable senator evidently misunderstood my remark. He says he does not care if this Bill miscarries. I say that if it does, there is no law for me to go by except the laws of the several States : and the present unsatisfactory condition of things will continue. When I speak of the responsibility of carrying out the duties of my office, I mean that I want to get this Bill through quickly in order to know where I am. </para>

It is not necessary to prolong the discussion. I shall content myself by dividing the committee. I do not know whether I shall carry the amendment, but I hope I shall ; and I trust that honorable senators will cast a vote which will give effect to the will, wishes, desires, and aspirations of the people of the Commonwealth by establishing the policy of a white Australia, not only in regard to the soil itself - and along our coasts, but also so far as relates to the manning of vessels which we subsidize for the carriage of our mails to and from Great Britain and other ports. </para>

                        <para>- I do not suppose the Postmaster-General would send mails by any ship without some sort of written agreement ; and that would, under the terms of the amendment, bring in such a line of ships as I have referred to. There is no interpretation clause in the Bill defining the word "contracts," and in the absence of an interpretation clause it appears to me to be certain that the amendment would apply. Therefore, I cannot see my way to support the amendment in its present form. </para>

                <para>
                    (South Australia). - -From the arguments which I have heard, it seems to me that the only intention
                    has is directly to exclude the P. and 0. Company from carrying mails. He states plainly that any ship having coloured crews, even if only carrying mails temporarily, and not under a definite contract, may be excluded. I do not understand that. I do not think that any one reading the amendment would be led to suppose that that was all that the honorable senator intended. It seems to me that the amendment provides quite clearly that the Postmaster-General cannot enter into contracts, whether for the carriage of one mail only, or for the carriage of mails for a period of years, with a company which employs other than white crews on the vessels to be engaged in carrying those mails. I fail to- see how
                    could contend that coloured servants, such as stewards or cooks, might be employed on such vessels. I do not think that
                    moved his amendment with any such narrow view as that in his mind. If I understand the amendment at all, the intention of it is to exclude from the contracts all coloured labour.
                    very clearly put it that he- did not believe in quibbles ; that he did not believe in having coloured servants, whether employed as waiters, or otherwise. Therefore, it is plain that he means that all coloured seamen, and coloured servants, shall be excluded from ships carrying mails.

He is intending to interfere with a contract which is made and must be made in my opinion, not anywhere within the territory of this Commonwealth, but in England. All the seamen who sign on in the service of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, do so, I believe, in London. </para>

                    Neild, whose sympathies are with the great mass of the people. I wish to be practical, and I do not attempt in my amendment to interfere with mails put on board any ship with the owners of which there is no contract for the carriage of mails. When the Postmaster-General comes to enter into a general contract for the carriage of mails to Great Britain, then my amendment means that a stipulation shall be inserted in that contract that the vessels on which the mails are carried shall be manned by white crews only. With regard to the French steamers and those of other companies who are paid for the carriage of our mails by weight, this amendment does not touch them at all. It simply deals with contracts which may be entered into in future.

                        <para>- If we are to make a -distinction between the two classes of periodicals or newspapers, then it ought to be made in favour of the publications which come out once a month, because as a rule they are the higher intellectually, and the weaker financially. The powerful dailies are well able to take care of themselves from the financial point of view. I trust that the committee, if it is going to make any exception, will make it iri favour of those financially weak journals which come out monthly. </para>

                        <para>- I hope this discussion will not be prolonged. I would sooner have the matter decided quickly, one way or the other ; because probably we shall be able to deal with it by regulation. The way I have looked upon the subject is this : Newspapers in some of the' States are being carried for nothing, and in other States at very low rates. I know that very strong pressure will be brought to bear upon the Postmaster-General, and also upon members of the Senate, for the purpose of getting the rates cut down as low as possible. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot give any figures upon the subject. Three -of the States are carrying newspapers free and three at a very low rate. I believe that when the half -penny postage rate for papers was introduced in Queensland, it made a difference of about £12,000 a year to the revenue. I do not want to do any injustice to any class of postal matter, but I think newspapers and periodicals should pal some fair rate, and I desire to have it equalized, so that there shall be no undue pressure upon any class of periodical. </para>

                        <para>- They have been carried free in three of the States, and in New South Wales, the most shocking example of all, the State has paid for special trains for carrying free newspapers to their destination. I hope the committee will bear that in mind. I know that pressure will be put upon them by persons who are interested in these matters. My only desire is to have such rates fixed as will be fair to everybody and enable us to reduce the postal charges. </para>

                        <para>- - Because they are a recapitulation of the news which comes out daily. They are newspapers which were intended to be helped by the very low . rates. That may not have been good policy, but it was the intention, although there may not be anything behind it. When we come to hear the claims of the newspaper proprietors to have their newspapers carried free, or at something approximating free carriage, we shall find that they ask for the transmission of their papers at a very low rate on the ground that they serve very important purposes ; that they have an educational influence and assist in the administration of the Government. A number of arguments of that kind are used which do not apply to the other classes of periodicals that I have referred to - publications which are issued at intervals longer than one week. I wish to place these in classes. Let the newspapers which have hitherto been well treated be in one class, and let us do justice to them. Then let us have these periodicals which are of such a diverse character, placed in another class so that we may be able to discriminate as to weight, having a certain charge for those which are of small size and something higher for those which are heavier. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable senator was in a large retail business he would probably issue a price list, and. that list would be news to a vast number of people ; of much greater consequence perhaps than that which is contained in the daily papers. The Postmaster-General says that it is claimed on behalf of newspapers that they are educational and necessary. I admit that we would not like to do without our newspapers. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. That is one of the arguments put forward for low rates. But tea and sugar and beef and bread, are much more necessary to the average citizen than his newspaper is. He can live without one, but not without the other. If we are going to institute a system of low carriage let us begin with the necessaries of life. </para>

I know that the honorable and learned senator has said that he wants to charge for newspapers, but he does not say that the Government are in favour of that. I want a Ministerial statement on the subject, because we know the pressure that will be brought to bear on the Government by all the big dailies. I believe that all the big dailies are in favour of free carriage of newspapers, whether in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, or Hobart. They will all be in favour of free carriage of newspapers, and I want a statement from the Postmaster-General as representing the Government, and not from himself alone. I take the statement he has made to mean that the Government are going to carry newspapers free. </para>

I hear of the tax that is going to be put on sugar. We will have newspapers carried free while the sugar of the working men is taxed. I request a Ministerial statement from the Postmaster-General on this subject before we go any further. I do not want the honorable senator to say what the rate will be, but simply to say if the Government are going to charge for the carriage of newspapers or not. When we have that information we will be in a position to discuss these other questions more intelligently than we are able to do at the present moment. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I rise to state that I am quite prepared to support the position taken up by the Postmaster-General. The discussion we have had so far clearly proves that it is necessary to make a distinction between what are understood as newspapers by 99 people out of every 100, and what are understood as periodicals. It is right that newspapers should be carried at a low rate, but, like the Postmaster-General, I am clearly of opinion that a charge should be made for all newspapers.

The Postmaster-General then proposes a graduated scale for periodicals, which appears to me to meet the equity of the case. I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that there are a considerable number of publications called newspapers which are nothing more or less than trade circularss., Some of them are very heavy publications. </para>

                        <para>- No : because what is there to prevent the regulations which deal with the subject of rates from differentiating as to newspapers published daily and weekly, and those other publications called newspapers and published once a month. There may be a differentiation as to time and as to weight. Nothing that I can see in the clause affects the rates, and we have been discussing something which does not help us in the practical interpretation of the clause at all. It merely gives an arbitrary definition of what a newspaper is, and leaves it entirely to the Postmaster-General by regulations, to impose what rates he thinks fair, subject to the approval of Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I believe that I can discriminate, but I do not know that that would give satisfaction, after having fixed this class, and put in the definition of a newspaper as any periodical fulfilling certain requirements, and published within a month. I do not want to express a very positive opinion on this point, '.but I know that it will give a great deal of dissatisfaction if I attempt, in the face of that, to make a distinction between a paper published weekly and one published monthly. What I wish to impress on the committee is that, as I propose it now, a publication which is issued within a limit of seven days is a newspaper, and goes at newspaper rates. Supposing that the amendment is carried, and everything that fulfils the definition and that is published at any time within a period of one month becomes a newspaper, a much larger number of publications will be brought in as newspapers, and if the Minister wants to exercise his discretion then as to what is or is not a newspaper, if he decides that a particular newspaper is not a newspaper, it does not then become a periodical to be carried at the same rate, or perhaps a little more, but it becomes printed matter, and is carried at a very much higher rate. Those who are thinking more particularly about some of these monthly periodicals, which I, for one, do not desire to stop or hamper in any way, have to bear in mind that if they do not strictly come under th definition of a newspaper they will be thrown out, and will be liable to be carried as printed matter. The magazine which has been quoted more than any other publication in this debate is exactly a case in point. If the Postmaster-General at any time should decide that it was not a newspaper, then it would have to pay printed-matter rates. During the early period of the debate it was said that if this definition were altered that magazine would then have to pay three times the rate it had been accustomed to pay. That argument means that if the time limit were altered so as to put that magazine within the category of newspapers it would have to be carried as printed matter. I meet that by my clause, by saying that if we cannot carry it as a newspaper we shall carry it as a periodical at an intermediate rate. I think that is a very fair thing. </para>

                        <para>- There is no place for a periodical class if we put in the 30 days here. All these periodicals right up to monthlies are then included in one category. If the Minister decides that any magazine or monthly is not a newspaper strictly within this definition, then he can refuse to carry it as a newspaper, and if the periodical class is not there it will have to go as printed matter at about three times the rate it has paid. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what I do not want. This newspaper is brought out almost exclusively in the interests of our railway men in the great State of Queensland. From every part of the world news is gathered relating to railway questions, such as the condition of labour, accidents, and train wrecks. How would it be possible to gather all that information in a week, and circulate it over our vast territory? It cannot be done. When we have 6,000 persons who depend largely on this monthly journal for literature of this nature, is it fair that it should be put out of the category of newspapers and described as a periodical? </para>

I have indicated already, with regard to that clause, that I will meet the wishes of the Municipal Association of "Victoria, by making an addition to the clause that the provision shall not apply in any case where work has been carried out with the consent of the Postmaster-General, and in accordance with the conditions required. AVe can discuss that matter when the Bill is recommitted. I may say, with regard to clause 136, that I think an amendment will not be necessary there.

                        <para>- I do not think that even for a layman it is a very difficult thing to distinguish it. I should say, to begin with, that it is a line wholly upon private property, used for private purposes, and having no connexion whatever with public telephone or telegraph lines. Take my own case, in my warehouse I have lines leading to fifteen different places in' the warehouse, not connected in any way with the Government system of lines, and why should the Postmaster-General bother himself about those ? </para>

                        <para>- That is certainly another matter, but if we are agreed that lines such as I have mentioned, lines upon private property, say, for private purposes only, are not to be interfered with, that is one difficulty cleared out of the way. Now, another difficulty is that with respect to lines to be put on stations, for instance, that may be intersected by a number of roads, man)' of them practically unused, some of them used to a small extent, and some probably main roads. What is wanted in that case is to utilize existing lines and to get permission to cross the roads. In connexion with the crossing of the roads I recognise that permission should be obtained from some one to cross a road, and probably a small fee should be paid in recognition of that permission. </para>

                        <para>- No. I can assure the honorable and learned senator that we have had quite enough of regulations. I mentioned the other day a case in Victoria where, though the heads of the department acknowledged that the regulation was absurd, they would not take the trouble to alter it. I wish to see a matter of this sort dealt with distinctly in the Bill itself, and that may be done by putting in the very words of the New South Wales regulation that I have just read. There would then be no question as to what private individuals are entitled to do. It does not impose upon the Postmaster-General any trouble whatever, and I know the present Postmaster-General wants to be saved all the trouble he can. I am voicing the wishes of a large number of persons who are interested in this matter all over the States. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot agree to this amendment, because I think it would produce a condition of anarchy. I am not a despot, although I have been called a despot and socialist, and all sorts of things, but I recognise that in the matter of telegraphy it is necessary that there shall be some authority, and we claim that the authority should rest with the Postal department, as we have no body analogous to the Board of Trade in Great Britain. As I propose to amend the clause, the -matter will be left perfectly clear with regard to these private lines. We do not want to interfere with a private line upon a man's property, so long as the line is wholly on his property, but if it crosses a road, we desire to make a charge which shall be simply an acknowledgment of the rights of the Postal department. I think that to fix the charge irrespective of the distance of the line would be unfair, because the length of the line, and number of roads that it crosses, are elements that should be taken into consideration. </para>

                        <para>- It can hardly be said to be prohibitive, because there are a number of these private lines in existence at the present time. Surely, if we have two sets of regulations, the charges under one of which are considered high and under the other not high enough, the matter is one which may be easily equalized, and it should be dealt with by regulation. Before the committee deals with this matter I would like honorable senators to carefully attend to what I propose doing. I propose to add, as a proviso to clause 77 the words - </para>

It will leave apparently to private persons the right to construct, maintain, and use telephones and telegraphs upon their own land, and the term " land," I understand, covers warehouses and so on. If that is so it is right, but why should we be limited to 12 feet from our border ? Surely we have a right to use our own property up to the border.

                    <para>- I entirely agree with the last speaker, and I must support his view if it comes to a division. At first, I was prepared to support the Minister's view, but I really do not see why a private owner, whether it be at a mine or in a warehouse, or other place, should be obliged to submit to a clause of this kind. We have the right now to erect these wires, and let it remain intact ! Surely no harm can be done ? The Minister should make some reasonable provision for a line to cross roads. </para>

                    SYMON (South Australia). - I think
                    has misapprehended the difference between the two amendments. There is no doubt that
                    alteration in the phraseology of that amendment does, if not altogether, at any rate to a large extent, remove the objection which seemed to me quite fatal to the amendment in its first shape.
                    must observe that clause 77 as it now stands enacts that the Postmaster-General shall have something. Parliament gives him something, and the effect of the exception is simply to prevent the giving of that something taking away what we, as free-born individuals, already possess ; and I think it is very important that that should be excepted from the gift which Parliament gives to the Minister for the purpose of the Act. If the proviso, on the other hand, had stood as it was, the effect would have been exactly the opposite. It would have- had the effect of declaring in the enacting part of the clause that the Minister got everything; and then came the proviso which enacted that the citizens of the Commonwealth should have something, given by the generosity of Parliament, which they already possessed. That is a situation which I do not think we ought to be in, and I agree with
                    as we are approximating to it very nearly in the amendment as altered, we ought to accept it.

                    <para>- I cannot grasp the meaning of telegraphs, because, the word includes telephones. Take a case where telephonic communication extends entirely within a warehouse. Perhaps it is carried from one department to another up to the highest part of the building, and at that point it may not be more than 3 or 4 feet from the wires outside the building. What effect would the clause have on the working of such a telephone ? </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - Sub-clause (2) raises the matter with reference to the crossing of roads. We have dealt with lines wholly on private property. Now we have to deal with lines upon property intersected by public roads. I have circulated an amendment which I have drafted somewhat hurriedly, and which I have no doubt will be improved upon by the legal members. For the purpose of having the matter discussed, I intended moving -

                    (Victoria),
                    Sargood's amendment is right enough so far as it goes, but it might shut out a number of equally good private lines. Supposing A is the owner of a block of land in a particular place, and B is the owner of a piece of land in another place, and that the two properties are intersected by a block of land which is not subject by statute to alienation. In that case this amendment would not apply. I suggest that if private lines do not interfere with public roads or with the Postmaster-General in any degree whatever, even if they cross a piece of land, including a road, they should not be penalized, subject to a small fee being paid for the right of crossing the road, and also subject to the control of the department.

                        <para>- I am aware of that, but there is no harm in pointing out these matters, because, if the amendment is not very carefully drafted, great abuse might arise in connexion with station lines. There are some very large reserves in the pastoral districts, and private owners on each side of a reserve may build a line across it. </para>

                    (Victoria). - There is no clanger about the reserves, there is more danger that the power will be abused in cities than in townships. Men are not going to erect private lines . at great expense for nothing. If a reserve is a mile or two across that does not matter where the line is constructed at an owner's private expense and for his private use. I can understand, however, that this might be abused in townships and cities, and I am prePared to SuPport the Minister in preventing any abuses of the kind.

                    <para>- The Sydney Chamber of Commerce has asked me to bring this matter forward, because the clause confers almost unrestricted power upon the Postmaster-General without any proper safeguard so far as private owners are concerned. I cannot pretend to draft the amendment they would like to put in, but I draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the fact that the powers conferred by the clause are considered very arbitrary. </para>

A similar clause was introduced into that Bill, but we struck it out. It .seems to me that it is an unnecessary invasion of private property.

                    <para>- I am sure the honorable senator will see that it is absolutely necessary that we should have this power in order to carry out the telephone system. It is altogether a different thing where we are dealing with electric lighting, and with cables carrying an enormous current of electricity. It is quite right that where such wires have to be carried to a great height, it should be on Government posts. But if the telephone system is to be carried out, we must have some lofty position from which we can start our wires to buildings in different directions. We carry a great number of wires in a cable underground, and then when we come to some particular point we have to carry the cable up to a considerable height, and from that high position start the wires in various directions. Let honorable senators consider the buildings here in Melbourne, and ask themselves how we are to have telephone communication with a lot of those buildings if we are not to have the right to fix our wires to the sides of a house. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and I know of many cases in which that has been done, and no harm whatever has arisen. You must take the wires into some of these buildings in order to supply the different people who may be living in them. Many of these large buildings have an enormous number of rooms and offices occupied by different persons, and unless we have the power to take the wires into such buildings we cannot put the tenants on to the exchange. </para>

As the thing really works no harm is done to private buildings, and it is the only way I can see in which we can distribute our telephone wires. </para>

I take it that the Postmaster-General will have the power under this clause to cut such trees down. My attention has been called to the fact, by the municipal authorities in a large number of cases up country, that this provision will necessitate the destruction of miles upon miles of avenues of trees that have been growing for the last 30 years. The other night I gave an instance of my own property, where I have an avenue of trees that have been growing for 30 years. If the Postmaster-General erects a telegraph or telephone line on the edge of the pathway there, I shall have to cut down the whole of those trees. </para>

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I referred just now to the fact that a similar clause had been submitted in an Electric Lighting Bill, and was withdrawn. I find that I was misinformed. It was a Bill introduced by the Postmaster-General of Victoria two years ago, which contained the same clause as affecting telegraphs ; and the representations which were made to him by the Melbourne City Council were such as to induce him to withdraw the clause. It has been pointed out to me, within the last few minutes, that if this clause is passed it will necessitate, probably at the freak of some Minister or officer, the cutting down of a number of trees in the city of Melbourne.

                    <para>- There is one thing which may well be considered. Of course, a good deal of this difficulty has arisen from the fact that under the Bill we deal with telephone as well as telegraph lines, and what is very proper for a telegraph line is riot so proper, convenient, or fair in relation to a telephone line. On the hills at Mount Lofty there are many instances where the telephone lines pass through gardens. Under the Bill, telegraph lines mean telephone lines, and the probability would be that, if there was a likelihood of interference in the working of a line - it might be fairly arrived at on the part of any officer - we might find that the trees would have to be cut down, or the proprietor, if he did not wish to have his trees cut down, would have to discontinue the use of his telephone. I could mention several instances in my own neighbourhood on Mount Lofty where that position would actually occur. I can see how' the confusion has arisen. Of course, these clauses are taken from Acts dealing only with telegraph lines, which are not restricted to private property as a rule, and which do not cross private property or pass through gardens. The South Australian Act, from which this provision is taken, has to do with telegraph lines and not with telephone lines. I ask the Postmaster-General to consider seriously whether 20 feet is not the proper distance as regards telegraph lines. When it says 20 feet, what is meant ? Does it mean from the trunk of the tree or from the branches ? If it is from the trunk it is not a* bit too much. </para>

                        <para>- That is the difficulty which I think the Minister will find himself in. Supposing that an officer reported that the trees in a garden, interfered with the working of the telephone line, the occupier would have either to discontinue his line or to submit to his trees being cut clown. It seems to me the solution is to consider whether an amendment might not be introduced to say that certain of these provisions should not apply to telephone lines, or else apply certain limitations. </para>

                        <para>- I could mention scores of instances on Mount Lofty, and I dare say there are many others near Melbourne and other places where a telephone line passes through very tall trees, and we might have. an officer say they did interfere with the line. I am not making the suggestion with a view to qualifying it in any way as to telegraph lines, because that may seem perfectly proper, and the original provision was intended to apply to them only : but when we have to deal with telephones we are brought face to face with a different situation. These clauses have not been considered in relation to telephone lines, but have been adopted under a definition which says that telegraphs shall mean and include telephone lines, when in many respects they are totally inapplicable. I suggest that the better way will be for the Minister to reconsider the provision, and see whether something may not be done to..meet the case of telephone lines in the altered circumstances. </para>

                    <para>honorable and learned senator is really answering a good deal of his argument by pointing out that 20 feet is not unreasonable in the case of telegraphs. Both telegraphs and telephones are dealt with in the Bill, and unless we devise some means of separating the clauses dealing with one from those dealing with the other, it seems to me that this clause is just as it should be. I would remind my honorable and learned. friend that the Postmaster-General here is taking, no doubt, rather extreme "powers. AH through the Bill he will find instances of very extreme powers given to the Minister. But it always must be taken that as these powers are to be used in the interests of the public, the Postmaster-General will not do any wanton mischief or damage to private property any more than is absolutely necessary. </para>

                        <para>- Y - Yes ; it is only whether these trees or whatever growth it is, in the opinion of the Postmaster-General or other officer, that obstruct or is likely to interfere with the proper working of the telegraph line, I take it, that the department, in carrying out a clause of this sort, will very likely arrive at some general view founded upon the scientific interest of the position, in regard, to telegraph lines, a certain distance of clearing is necessary, and in regard to telephone lines, a much smaller distance is 060688017. All wo do here is to give authority to the officer to determine which in the particular circumstances ought to be left. I think the last speaker will see that after all this is only one out of a hundred very large powers given to the Minister. If these powers are to be exercised unreasonably, then undoubtedly a great portion of this Bill ought to be excised. If, on the other hand, wc are to trust the Postmaster-General to use these powers in the interests of the public, I think this is a power which might very well be left to him.
