                        <para>- The Government agree with the honorable senator's desire that in general papers which are of sufficient importance to read in Parliament, should be laid before both Houses unless they relate exclusively to the business of either House, and that course will be followed in future. Instructions have been given that all copies of papers laid upon the table of one House only shall be circulated amongst the members of the other. The Government will take "care that no undue preference is shown in this matter to either House of the Legislature. </para>

                    <para>- I hope, that the Senate will not entertain the 'motion. This is the most deliberate attempt that could possibly be made to belittle the Senate and treat it as occupying the position of the second Chambers of the different States. We are apparently to be treated by the Ministry in the matter of the public expenditure simply as a Chamber of revision. </para>

                        <para>- Scarcely that. I suppose I am not out of order in referring incidentally to the fact that the Bill contains matter that has been the subject of a lengthy debate in another place, and may reasonably be considered as entitled to full consideration here. But the practice that has obtained in the colonies, now States, of treating the Upper Chambers as having no right practically to discuss finance is apparently to be applied by the Government to the Senate in connexion with finance. </para>

                    Downer, who told us with so much emphasis the other "day that he stood by the Constitution, will stand by the Constitution to-day as regards this motion, and see that at least the Senate has a proper opportunity of dealing with these important questions. I may refer, I assume without being guilty of any breach of decorum, to the fact that we have every reason to believe that in the Bill there are items relating to 'the officers of the Senate. It may be the wish of the Senate to make certain suggestions to the other House on some of the items. I do not see how we can be expected to deal properly with the measure if we are to suspend the standing orders, and rush it through, in the manner indicated. Besides, sir, this is a peculiar motion. It is apparently to apply not only to this Bill, but to every Bill of a similar character that comes up, and I for one certainly protest against the Ministry, [ do not care pf whom they are constituted, asking for power for all time, or for the whole session, to rush through appropriation measures in this way.

                        <para>.- If the honorable and learned gentleman is not in a hurry perhaps he will withdraw the motion and let the Senate proceed with the Bill in the ordinary manner. I certainly, if need be, will call for a division on the motion, because I consider that it means the initiation of a most pernicious practice. I cannot believe that the Federal Cabinet, who are not ignorant of constitutional usage or unacquainted with the intentions of the Commonwealth Act, are acting in this manner without proper consideration. I am driven to the conclusion that this is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the 1 known powers of the Senate in dealing with matters of finance, and as such I offer the proposal my absolute objection. </para>

                        <para>- We can reject the Bill if we see fit. AVe can reject this motion if we see fit. But we are in this position, that if money is required it is only a reasonable thing that the Senate should give its assistance to provide the necessary funds, but not to provide those funds in the dark. We are not going to say - " We will give you power to spend £500,00.0 as you please to direct." Would that not be an absurd position, when we have powers given to us by way of suggestion. Having such powers, -it becomes our duty to exercise them whenever we find it necessary to do so ; otherwise we are false to our trust and false to our duty. I say that, in the present position of affairs, this is a direct insult, a flout to this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It may have been given unwittingly, and in gross ignorance, but is it creditable to a Government ? Are they to come here with legislation and say - " We do not mean what this thing says on the face of it. We mean something else. We were too ignorant to understand the Constitution, and to understand the position you occupy as a second Chamber. We thought you were going to be content to accept the position of a Legislative Council." That is the position, notwithstanding the brave words uttered by the Vice-President of the Executive Council the other day, .when he, a member of the Government, claimed the rights and powers and duties which we believe we are entitled to and intend to insist upon. On the very first opportunity that arises we are met with a document that is either a flout or a challenge, or an evidence of - gross ignorance. I certainly feel I should be false to the position I occupy as a representative of the people, because we are really representatives of the people as much as the members of the other Chamber, if I consented to this action. </para>

I am quite prepared to think that the Bill was not sent up in its present form by t]ie Government for the purpose of flouting this Chamber. When we come to remember the actual terms of the Constitution, it does appear to me that there will be no alternative for us but to see that the items which have been circulated only for our information are attached as a schedule. If my honorable friend, the Postmaster-General sees his way to concede that which I think is a most reasonable request, then it will be competent for us to exercise the powers which are reposed in us by the Constitution Act. All that we learn from the Bill that lias been circulated, is that a sum of £491,882 is to be applied out of the consolidated revenue in the manner set forth in clause 2, which says - </para>

                        <para>- I want to point out the difficulty. According to the terms of our Constitution Act we have the right to amend Bills having for their object the construction of public works. It is only in Bills which have for their object the expenditure of money for the ordinary services of the yew that we have the right of suggesting Amendments. So, therefore, I say that if there was an item of the kind to which I have referred, it would be an extraordinary expenditure, and, arguing by analogy, we would have the right of making a suggestion as to how the expenditure should take place. If. for instance, it was proposed to expend £50,000 on such a work as a monumental bridge, we would have- the right to say whether the money should be so expended or not. If we look at the terms of the Constitution Act we see that - </para>

That is the difficulty we shall have to consider in this connexion. I am certain that, quite unwittingly, the Government have forgotten the altered conditions. The Government have failed to realize that this is not a mere glorified Upper House. I want it to be understood that do not suggest for one moment that we are co-ordinate in, all respects with the other House. I realize that responsible government has been embodied in the Commonwealth Act; that the other Chamber have the power to make and unmake Governments; that it predominates in numbers, which is an important consideration in certain conditions; and that certain excessive powers are given to it in regard to finance. I do not suggest, therefore, that we are coordinate in every respect with the other House ; but, barring finance, we are. The Act distinctly says in section 54 - </para>

I was under the impression that the amount mentioned in it was the amount mentioned in the Estimates. I find, however, that that is not so, and I therefore wish to explain that I believe the Bill is in the form in which it was passed by another place.

                        <para>- We have to accept the message telling us that this is the Bill, but there is nothing to show that these Estimates which make up the amount of Supply, as required for the public service, are the Estimates which were approved by the House of Representatives, and which are practically part of this Bill. This' is like giving us something with one hand and withdrawing it with the other. In the ordinary circumstances, of course, when an Appropriation Bill comes to an Upper House the Estimates are not laid before the legislative Council to be gone into in detail. But the Senate is in a different position. It is our duty and our right to go into these Estimates in detail, and if that is to be done they must be brought before us either in the Bill or in some way similar to that in which they are introduced in the other House, by means of our going into a sort of Committee of Supply to consider these details. In some shape or other there must be brought under the notice of the Senate the Estimates as adopted by the other House, because they are the matters which are for our revision. Instead of that, however, there have been handed round with the Bill Estimates that are entirely new ; not the Estimates as they emanated from the House of Representatives, but something quite fresh for us to deal with. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that the initial difficulty has arisen in the way this measure has been carried through the other House. That House - I am not blaming them - have not unnaturally failed to recognise the altered conditions. AVe are engaged in a new practice, and must try to arrive at a proper' way of carrying it out. The difficulty must either be remedied in the other House, where it has arisen, or we must have something in the nature of a Committee of Supply here to which the Estimates as passed by the other House may be submitted for revision. I suggest, not merely as a matter affecting the privileges of the Senate at all, but as one affecting a new system of parliamentary government under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, that the position had better be reconsidered, because this -will be a precedent that will govern us as long as we. last as a Parliament. After all, 1 think, time will be saved and difficulty will be avoided if that course is now adopted. </para>

                    said. I think the debate that has taken place would have been more appropriate upon the Bill than upon this particular motion. I moved this motion after giving notice in accordance with the practice which I think is observed in all legislative Chambers, whether Legislative Assemblies or Legislative Councils, throughout the British dominions. There, the standing orders are suspended in order to allow an Appropriation Bill to go through all its stages in one day. Of course, each House is absolutely master of its own proceedings, and when the Senate or any other Assembly elects to suspend its standing orders, it does so with a view of putting 'it in its own power to expedite business if it chooses to do so. But if the other House is not anxious to go on with business I can see no advantage whatever in suspending the standing orders. However, this debate on the Bill has taken place on the motion I have moved, and I see that the case does present some difficulty, in consequence of honorable senators not having in a proper and official way before them the Estimates on which the Bill has been framed. I think that difficulty can be overcome by laying on the table a copy of the Estimates and moving that they be referred to the committee.

                        <para>- A slight correction will have to be made. The copy I propose to lay on the table, and ask the Senate to refer to the committee on the Bill, will be a correct copy of the Estimates. And then I apprehend, if the Senate desires to exercise its right under the 'Constitution of suggesting alterations, it can suggest, if it choose, that the amount be reduced by a certain sum, and indicate the particular item to which objection is taken. I think that no difficulty will occur then. I do not suppose the Senate has any objection to the ordinary practice of suspending the standing orders to enable the passage of measures to be expedited. If it is agreeable to honorable senators who have taken such a lively interest in this question, as no doubt is their duty and their right, I would suggest that they allow this motion to pass. 1 shall then move that the second reading of the Bill be an order of the day for to-morrow, and in the meantime I shall take all necessary steps to have all the information that is desired placed at their disposal. </para>

Of course this is very important, and we are all anxious to have our true constitutional path marked out for us. We shall all be glad to assist in getting the thing put 6n right lines. With that view, of course, if this debate is adjourned, and there is another step taken, it will be advisable that the Senate shall have an opportunity of discussing the matter at length, if necessary, with a view to bringing it to a proper conclusion.

He may find himself in the position of not being able to carry his motion for the suspension of the standing orders to-morrow. Supposing the Senate disagrees with the new procedure he may suggest, then we shall be left exactly where we are. What I ask him to consider in the interim is, what course will be adopted in that event, so as to save time? We do not want this thing to have to go back to the other House if it can be avoided. I am simply calling the honorable gentleman's attention, through you, sir, to that position, so that he may be prepared to give us the fullest information, and also to decide on the course he shall adopt supposing that the Senate disagree with the procedure that is proposed. </para>

With all due deference, I am not at all sure that the House is the best place in which to decide a question of the kind, although, of course, ultimately it must deal with it. Would it not be very much better to appoint a small select committee to consider this very important question, and thrash it out fully, and then report to the Senate ?

The Minister proposes to lay these Estimates on the table. What is the good of that? They will not form a part of the Bill. Moreover, section 53 of the Constitution refers distinctly to the fact that we may return a proposed law to another place with suggestions. These Estimates are certainly not a proposed law. </para>

                    <para>- 1 entirely agree with the remarks of the last speaker. It is exceedingly important that we should proceed with very great care. 1 have been thinking the matter over very carefully while the discussion has been going on, and I can see a way out of the difficulty. By the Constitution Act we have the right of making suggestions, and therefore it is only proper that we should be placed in a position to make suggestions. We cannot make the suggestions we desire to make on this Bill. We may desire to make alterations on a variety of lines, and the point taken by the Postmaster-General, that we might reduce the total amount, and indicate the lines, might lead to all sorts of trouble, because the other House might agree to slight alterations on some of the lines, but not on the others, and there would be no means of arriving at a definite conclusion. The only possible way by which effect can he given to our constitutional rights is that we should be able to put our finger on an item, and say - " That is an item we want to reduce," or "that is an item which we suggest should be reduced." The other House would be in a. position to agree or disagree with the alteration. Whatever course is adopted, there is only one possible way out of the difficulty, and that is to embody these Estimates in some way in the Bill. The other House, I dare say, in all good faith, sent up the Estimates in the ordinary form, and they did not very probably foresee the difficulties that might arise in connexion with the power of the Senate to make suggestions. </para>

                        <para>- The Estimates, as they have passed, might be authoritatively sent up for our information. If we go into committee on the Bill, one of the suggestions we can make is that the Estimates form a schedule to the Bill, then we can go through the items and offer suggestions on them. I do not know whether we should - the chances are that we should not - suggest very many alterations. On looking through the items casually, I see no particular lines on which I shall propose to offer the slightest suggestion. If we adopt the course I propose, it will be a precedent for the Government on future occasions to embody in Appropriation Bills the items. I think that may be done very readily, and we can get over the difficulty in that way. </para>

                <para>Suppose it does not deal only with such appropriation, is not the whole Bill bad and is it hot our business to reject it ? How can we exercise our undoubted right unless we have all the items before us. These are the only remarks I have to make. I make them not only for the purpose of pointing out that the remedy suggested is impracticable, but in order that I, with others, may avail myself of this opportunity of showing the House of Representatives that we will not by any carelessness on our part allow the Senate to fall into that second place which the other House would apparently have it occupy. </para>

                        <para>- I may answer the first question off-hand. The House of Representatives has sent us a Bill by message. It is the only Bill before us. The fact that the Minister proposes to lay a paper -oh. the table, does not alter the Bill, which contains only one or two clauses, so that I do not think the point is whether the whole Bill is before us. We have the whole Bill in the form in which it has been sent to us. What they did in the other House I do not know, and I do not think it matters. They have only sent to us a Bill containing one or two clauses and mentioning a lump sum. As to the other point, I should like time to consider it. </para>

                        <para>- The question before the Senate is that the adjourned debate be an order of the day for to-morrow. I admit that I have allowed senators to extend their remarks more than they ought to have done, but, seeing the great importance of the matter, I thought myself justified in doing so. Still we must deal with the motion before us, and the only amendment that could be moved would be one adjourning the debate to some other day or hour. </para>

                    (Victoria).- This Bill, as it is presented to us, is a well-recognised Supply Bill, and it varies very considerably from what we have hitherto known as the usual Appropriation Bill. What we want to try and do is to initiate a new arrangement as between the two Houses, in regard to Supply Bills. If the Supply Bill followed the precedent of the Appropriation Bill, the grave constitutional difficulty which we are now experiencing could not arise.
                    made a suggestion as to how we might practically deal with the matter now. I have taken the liberty of calling attention to the provision in section 53 of the Constitution Act, where, in my opinion, there arises a difficulty in the way of carrying out what we desire to do. The true way is an alteration of the arrangements as between the two Houses, and therefore I rise to support the motion to give the necessary time ,to the representative of the Government in the Senate to consider the point. If necessary, there should be a conference between the two Houses for the purpose of settling this important matter, so that we may decide upon the constitutional method of dealing with these questions, having regard to the difficulties which have been raised. If the Postmaster-General can persuade his colleagues to alter the practice, and to send us up an interim Appropriation Bill - that is to say, a Supply Bill with this schedule added - then I venture to say we will have no difficulty in dealing with it. That is the spirit and intention of section 53, and I think it will be found to be the only constitutional procedure.

                    SARGOOD (Victoria). - I think the Postmaster-General must feel that the Senate is practically unanimous against the Bill in its present form. We have listened to a most interesting discussion upon it, and as time goes on fresh points are taken. Probably, with a little delay, some other points equally as important may arise. The Postmaster-General is in charge of this Bill, and he asks us to agree to the postponement of the discussion till to-morrow. As a matter of courtesy I think we ought to accede to his request. That will enable him to consult his colleagues, and I feel perfectly certain that when they have looked into this matter fully they will be convinced that the Senate is right.

                        <para>- Really I do think that this is trifling with the Chamber. The honorable the Postmaster-General proposes to have the second reading made an order of the day for to-morrow. He proposes an exceptional procedure. This is a Supply Bill, and in accordance with the usual practice Supply Bills are hurried through by means of the suspension of the standing orders. The Postmaster-General intended to adopt that course this evening, but the universal feeling of the Senate was that the procedure ought to be considered, and he moved the adjournment of the debate on the motion till to-morrow. That means that the whole of the proceedings with regard to this Bill are to stand over, otherwise we have been wasting two hours in endeavouring to explain the opinions which we all entertain in regard to this procedure, with a view of assisting the Postmaster-General to rectify it. I do not think that it is treating us fairly, that this motion for the suspension of the standing orders should be adjourned until to-morrow, and that meantime another step should be taken in this Bill, to which the Senate does not assent. If we pass this motion, we accept the position that this is a Bill which ought to be set down for debate on its second reading, when we all say that it is irregular. I think we have made a mistake already in permitting the Postmaster-General to have the first reading. The honorable and learned gentleman tells us that the time for raising these constitutional questions is the second reading. I do not wish to occupy any further time on this point, because I think the Minister must see that there is nothing to be gained whatever by making the second reading of the Bill an order of the day for to-morrow. </para>

                        <para>- No ; it is intercepted. Of course, if that were the case I assure the Postmaster-General that it would greatly mitigate what I have to say about his proposal. The position I point out to the Minister is that he has the Bill read a first time, and then moves a motion for the suspension of the standing orders in order to enable the Bill to pass through all its remaining stages, including second reading, without delay. </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining of its having been done. I am only pointing out that as we still have the motion for the suspension of the standing orders it intercepts all other proceedings. It was intended to intercept them. It was intended that no other step should be taken in relation to this Bill, either in moving its second reading, or in setting it down for second reading, until the Standing orders were suspended. Then the Minister says I shall not proceed with it today, I shall proceed with it to-morrow. Very good. It is ruled that that is in order. He moves it to-morrow ; then, if it is carried, he moves his second reading, and goes into committee and takes his third reading. </para>

                    (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - If I may be permitted I wish to say a few words as I did not speak in moving the motion because I thought it would go as a formal matter. The practice under the standing 'orders is somewhat different from the practice I have been accustomed to in the suspension of the standing orders. I. have been accustomed always to the suspension of the standing -orders before the Bill comes down. If we knew that a Bill was coming down we moved for the suspension of the standing orders to enable that Bill to pass through all its stages in the one day. The course adopted here by the standing orders is to allow the Bill to be read a first time, and then to move as a contingent motion that the standing orders be suspended in order to enable the Bill to go through all other stages without delay. If that is agreed to it allows the second reading to be taken at once on the same day, next the committee stage, and then the third-reading stage. After the Bill has been read a first time, 1 move a motion for the suspension of the standing orders. The House has not agreed yet to pass that motion, and the debate has been adjourned until to-morrow. Therefore, the Senate has decided up to the present time, so far as to-day is concerned, that it will not suspend the standing orders. Then I act under our. standing orders, and move that the second reading shall be made an order of the day for to-morrow, and if I do not do that the Bill lapses altogether.

The Bill has been read a first time, and a difficulty has arisen. The Bill has been strongly criticised, and while a number of honorable senators think that some alterations should be made, perhaps some hold that no alteration will make the Bill satisfactory to the Senate. But whichever view they take there has been a general feeling to allow this matter to stand over till to-morrow, and let us see in the meantime whether anything can be done to cure what I would call the alleged defects. Let us have until to-morrow to see whether we can present the Bill in such a way, or supplement it in such a way as will get over the defects which have been pointed out. </para>

Just one point, before I sit down. The reason why it is necessary to have still on the paper the motion for the suspension of the standing orders, is not in order to allow the Bill to be read a second time to-morrow, but to enable the Senate, if it chooses to do so, to proceed from the second reading stage to committee, and from committee to third-reading stage. But if we can get over this difficulty, and the Senate is satisfied to allow the Bill to pass, it will have power to pass it to-morrow, which it would not have if this motion for suspension did not so appear. So, really, if the Senate will consent to the motion I have moved - and it is absolutely necessary that it should be done unless the Bill is to disappear from the paper - we shall be in this position tomorrow : The Bill comes up for the second reading ; honorable senators can discuss it at full length ; if they are not satisfied with it they can- </para>

                <para>SenatorSir FREDERICK. SARGOOD (Victoria). - The course proposed by the Postmaster-General seems to me the only course we can pursue. The standing orders, which differ somewhat from those which we have been accustomed to in Victoria, distinctly lay clown that after the first reading the second reading shall be made an order of the day for some future day. I do not know that we shall be in any worse position to-morrow unless honorable senators decide at once to reject the Bill. But it must be borne in mind that tacitly, if not actually, we have agreed, as a matter of courtesy, to the Minister's request for time to consider what should be done, and to report practically to us tomorrow what steps would be taken with the Bill. I do not think that is an unreasonable request for any Minister to make in connexion with a Bill, and 1 am quite sure the Senate will grant it. I see no harm in it. Suppose the Minister comes down to-morrow and moves the second reading of the Bill, we shall know exactly what to do, hut I can hardly conceive that he will be so unwise, if I may use the expression, as to take that course. </para>

                    SARGOOD.I find, sir, that your ruling in regard to speaking on the first reading of a Bill is entirely new, so far as we in "Victoria are concerned, and I think it is contrary to the practice of the House of Commons. I happened to be at home when the Compensation of Workmen's Bill was introduced, and on the first reading 134 members spoke.

                        <para>- We have the. power of suggestion, not the power of amendment, so far as this Bill is concerned.. The duty of scrutinizing. every item in the Estimates is imposed upon us by the Constitution. If the Constitution did not contemplate that we should make that scrutiny it would never have given us the power of suggesting amendments. How can we suggest amendments on something which is not before us? The tiling is simply impossible. I cannot see any way of getting the Estimates placed before the Senate in a regular fashion except by the re-introduction of the Bill in the other House with the Estimates tacked on as a schedule, and then when it is sent up in that form we can discuss it. I think the proper course for the Minister is to permit the Bill to lapse, because if it comes up before us to-morrow I shall not have the slightest scruple in voting against it. As a member of the Senate, I claim the right to scrutinize every item in the Estimates. I may not exercise that right, but I am sent here by my constituents for that purpose, and I claim that I ought to be afforded every facility to carry out my duty: Unless the Bill is brought up in an altered form, I certainly shall vote against it. I do not see that anything is to be gained by this procedure, except that in the interim the Minister may consult with his colleagues, and the Government may see the stupidity of the position in which they have placed themselves, and may put the whole matter in shape by doing what I have suggested or taking some other course which may seem to them proper and right. I really do think that the best thing for the honorable gentleman to do would be to let the Bill lapse. </para>

                    (Western Australia). - I feel inclined to vote against this motion to have the second reading of the Bill put down for to-morrow. I am not at all disposed to be factious in my opposition, or to do anything that would hinder the Postmaster-General from consulting his colleagues. In the first place I do not see how consultation can metamorphose the Bill on the table. Unless consultation can put another Bill there, it will not do any good. As
                    Symon correctly pointed out, this is an attempt on the part of the Postmaster-General to put two strings to his bow, in order to effect what he knows is contrary to the wishes of the Senate. The honorable gentleman stated that he was doing what he would have been entitled to do had he never moved the suspension of the standing orders at all. He claims to be put in the position he would have been in had that motion not been brought forward. Let him withdraw the motion.

                    (South Australia). - I do not think that a little more time wasted in endeavouring to get ourselves out of the tangle we have got ourselves into will be amiss. Every senator has a right to express his opinion. I agree with
                    as to the Government wanting two strings to their bow, and they are quite justified in having them if we allow them. The position we have got into is a peculiar one, and arises out of the different standing orders that have been adopted in the different States that now form the Commonwealth. The Government showed a want of consideration by sending up a measure that was not in accordance with the Senate's interpretation of the Constitution. As far as I understand the position it is this : The Postmaster-General came here to-day with a Bill which was read a first time. The suspension of the standing orders was then moved for the purpose of passing that Bill through all its stages without delay, and the debate on the motion was adjourned at the request of senators and with the concurrence of
                    Now that is unfinished business. There was also a motion moved that the adjourned debate come on tomorrow. It does not matter whether the motion now before the Senate is carried or not. That is bound to come before the House to-morrow unless we take other action.

                        <para>- A great difference. We have also to consider the committee and third reading stages. I presume the second reading would be moved whether the motion for the suspension of the standing orders were carried or not. </para>

                    (Queensland - Postmaster-General). - If the two motions are on the paper, then if the motion for the suspension of the standing orders is not carried [ can go on to the second reading. On the other hand, if the motion before the Chamber now is not carried - if the second residing is not made an order of the day for to-morrow - what position will I be in?

                        <para>- The Bill will be off the notice-paper then. There seems to be a feeling of misapprehension in regard to the order of business. I shall certainly put the motion for the suspension of the standing orders first. We can then continue the debate and decide the matter one way or the other. I would ask any senator what harm can there be in this Bill appearing on the notice-paper. If the Senate -agrees that the standing orders are not to be suspended, I shall be in a position to move the second reading. On the other hand if the Senate allows the standing orders to be suspended, then also I shall be in a position to move the second reading. There has been a general feeling on the part of the Senate that it is desirable that this should be postponed and a decision come to tomorrow, and I therefore trust there will be no further opposition. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion the stopping of letters addressed to any particular person who may be running a sweep is not going to do the Commonwealth any good. We have had some experience in Queensland regarding this matter. Tattersall was established there, and the sweeps were adding to the revenue of Queensland something like £30,000 a year, principally through the Postal and Telegraph department. A large amount of money was being circulated. Tattersall employed a large staff of clerks and all the benefits derivable from the spirit of gambling* possessed by the people of Australia were given to the people of Queensland. In a weak moment, and I think in an idiotic moment, the Queensland Government passed an Act for the suppression of gambling, and hunted Tattersall out of the State. With what result ? Did it stop gambling ? Not a bit of it. The people in Queensland still send their money to George Adams, of Tattersalls sweeps, who is now located in Hobart, with the difference that the revenue of Queensland has been reduced £30,000 per year, and that the benefit derived by the circulation of a large sum of money has been lost to that State. </para>

                        <para>- I think it is in clause 27, but I am not certain. I view the granting of the power with very great distrust, because the value of our post-office is that all matters between person and person are held to be absolutely sacred and confidential, and are not to be interfered with by any other person. To give authority to open correspondence between person and person is in my opinion to destroy the real value of our postal system. There* is one thing that we can all boast of as Britishers, that whenever a man is persecuted in his own country the one place where he can be absolutely protected is the British Empire. There was at one time a man named Mazzini who fled from Italy and found shelter in England. The postal authorities, yielding to the demands of the Italian Government, ventured to open all the reformer's correspondence. The matter, however, was taken up and it was passed in the House of Commons that in no set of circumstances whatever should correspondence be interfered with in any of the post-offices of Great Britain. We should not start the Commonwealth by permitting a postmaster or any one under him to open the correspondence belonging to another. </para>

                        <para>- I like the intention to be expressed in clear language, and I merely ask the Minister to be content with the appointment of one Deputy Postmaster-General, and not to have a deputy in each State, but to have an under-secretary in each State, who will be subordinate to the Postmaster-General and his deputy. I remember very well that during the federal campaign in our State all these matters were discussed. Some of us who have taken for many years an active part in federal matters had a great deal to do in trying to convince a number of people scattered over our vast territory of 664,000 square miles, no place being exempt from population, as to the desirability - nay, the necessity - of adopting federation as not only a good thing for that State but as a good thing for Australia. Among the reasons we had to advance was, that so far from having six Postmasters-General, we would have only one Postmaster-General ; that, so far from having six commandants over the military and naval forces, we would have only one commandant. So I might go the round of the circle, but it is not necessary to do so. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should be content to have a Deputy Postmaster-General, to be paid reasonably, and to be armed with authority such as he would exercise himself on all occasions, in his absence or under his direction. I come now to a very important provision of the Bill. Clause 15 rightly gives power to the Postmaster-General to enter into contracts with steam-ship companies, and in other ways, for the carriage of mails. It has been said that in contracts of this kind it should be stipulated that all mail boats subsidized by the Commonwealth should be manned by white crews. I entirely agree with that view. I think I may reasonably claim to have some little concern in this matter. In 1S89, from my place in Parliament, I think I was instrumental in inducing the Queensland Government to insert that stipulation in the mail contracts with the steam-ship companies. I hope to see the Senate approving of an amendment of this character, which, if it is not moved by another honorable senator, I shall move myself. It should be stipulated in clear and unmistakable language that no steam-ship company, unless its ships are manned with white crews, shall be subsidized for the carriage of our mails to any part of the world. That will be in harmony with the policy of Queensland for many years, and I am quite sure it will be gauging correctly the feeling and the desire of the people of the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will bring forward such an amendment, and save a private member the duty of moving it. Some reference has been made to the withholding of the royal assent to a Bill which passed the Queensland Parliament last year, empowering the Government to give a grant of money to still further aid some of the existing sugar mills, and some sugar mills to be brought into existence, to enable them to carry on their operations, and if I judge correctly the sentiments expressed by some honorable senators it is the sound of a warning note to be careful of what we are doing, in case the royal assent is withheld. I do not regard that refusal as a warning. Certainly I do not regard it as a very serious warning, and I am sure that Queensland, without coming unnecessarily into conflict with the Home Government or with the mother country, will assert itself, and will see that no harm be done, and that the aid and assistance which was granted last year will find its way in some other direction. But if we have to be deterred from carrying out the great principle of a white Australia merely from fear that the royal assent may be withheld from any Bill that we may pass, then I think there is sufficient manhood and vigour in the country to assert itself, and in such a manner that the principle will be established, and that some means will be found of giving effect to the wish and the will of the people. I pay no heed at all to that warning note which has been sounded. I certainly shall assert my opinions, and I am quite sure that the opinions which have been expressed by some honorable senators are not in entire harmony with the views of the great mass of the people. If it be essential, as think it is, for the preservation of the race, and for other reasons which it is not necessary to go into in detail, to establish a white Australia and to exclude all coloured1 aliens, then in order to carry out that policy thoroughly it should be provided that any mail ships which are subsidized by the Government shall be manned with white labour. It may be contended that a difficulty may arise inasmuch as we may be limited to one company. That I do not think is a difficulty at all. I think that one of the largest companies sending mail boats to these shores has for years manned its vessels with white crews. I refer to the Orient Company. Then the British India Company, one of the most powerful companies in the world - which for many years clung tenaciously even in Australian ports to black crews - has entered into an arrangement with the Queensland Government to carry their mails in boats with white crews, and the mails are being carried more quickly and efficiently than they were carried when the ships were manned with black crews. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to measure this great question on the lines of £ s. d. If it is merely a question of cheapness, I tell the honorable senator that. I am not in the cheap market. I am by no means gauging a matter of this kind by the consideration of how much it is going to cost - whether it is going to cost £1 or 15s. If it is going to cost £1 to vindicate this great principle, and make this land the home of free white men, and not run the risk of deteriorating the race, I for one am prepared, to give the £1 rather than the 15s. </para>

                        <para>- I am assuming that, inasmuch as the Bill is presented by a legal gentleman having as colleagues four other legal gentlemen, they have agreed that the provision is a right one. Then we come to the provision in clause 150, which confers certain large powers upon the Minister. In the case of a defaulter or any member of the staff who may commit a breach of discipline, the clause gives the Postmaster - General power to settle the matter without a prosecution. I think that is a wise provision. I have had some little experience in the post-office as an employee, and I cannot say that there were during my time any very serious breaches of discipline or peculations. </para>

                        <para>- We should interfere for the good of the Commonwealth. If we can regulate it, if there is any profit in it - and I think that if there were not large profits it would not be receiving so much encouragement to-day - we should do so, and allow the Commonwealth Government to reap the advantage. So far as Western Australia is concerned, there is a great deal more gambling there than some honorable senators seem to understand. We have heard a great deal about the totalizator as practised in Tasmania, and while that State has been dubbed the Australian Monte Carlo, I believe that in the matter of the totalizator Western Australia holds a very good second place. If my suggestion were adopted with regard to the totalizator we should put on a brake, and the step would be one in the right direction. Reference has been made to interference with the liberty of the subject. We cannot possibly have laws unless this is done more or less ; the more laws you pass the more circumscribed is the liberty of the subject. , If the alterations I have suggested are made in committee I shall be prepared to support the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable senator think that the Postmaster-General and the authorities who have had so much experience are going to do something which will cause a volcano to spring, up in central Australia because Parliament is not sitting? It is law all the time, I hear. Of course, it will be in operation, I know as well as the honorable senator, from the time it is gazetted ; but what damage can be done in six months or even in twelve months ? We have been living under six different postal systems for the last 501 years in the different States, and we have managed to drag along. The people have prayed for federation so that they should be all brought together, and now we are afraid that the very authorities that dragged1 us so far without catastrophe are going to lead us into a bush and there leave us like strayed billygoats. Honorable senators should have some sense in discussing a question of this description. The reasonable position which .they should take up is to allow those who have the greatest knowledge and the most experience to fix this schedule in the interests, of all the States. And when they have done that and laid it on the table of the Houses,, whether it has been in existence or not, it will not hurt the people very much more than they have been hurt up to the present time, and then if there is anything objectionable, they can employ their individual wisdom and their individual intelligence in ferreting out anything which is wrong, or which is likely to oppress them or then- friends, or any citizen in the Commonwealth. If they do that they will be doing their duty to the people they are representing. In clause 6 we find the definition of a newspaper. I. would like that definition to be extended, lt states that this publication is to have certain qualities, and that it must, be published at least once every seven days. With that portion of the clause I disagree, and I shall certainly do all I possibly can to assist in amending it. In the different States there are sections of the community who have not an intimate knowledge of our language and to whom our daily,, our weekly, and our bi-weekly publications are of very little use. Through associating together and working in a co-operative manner, they have been able to establish periodicals that to them are really newspapers, but the readers are not of .such magnitude that it would pay them to publish weekly. In some instances they may be published every fortnight. In other instances they may be published only once a month. I would like to alter the term of seven days. I do not care how stringent we make the definition of a newspaper in other respects, but I hope we shall give every section, whether they be Scandinavians, or French, or German, or Irish, or "Welsh, or Gaelic, for that matter, a show, so that they may read the news of the day and have public questions debated or reasoned out in their own language. It is in the interests of these sections of the community that I would like the term to be extended. I would also like the definition of a newspaper to be so relaxed that many monthly publications which are of very great value, I dare say, to the great majority of the senators- </para>

                        <para>- There are magazines which, besides giving honorable senators and every person in the community information as to what is going on in all parts of the world - which probably they would have no chance of getting in any weekly or daily newspaper - have not only an educative influence, but have the effect of enlarging the opinion of every reader with respect to the affairs of other countries, and our relationship with all the different parts of the world. In the interests of these magazines, I think that something might be done even to extend the definition, so that it might include a great number of them. But there is something else - I do not know whether it ought to be included in this Bill, but it ought to be dealt with somewhere in the legislation of the Commonwealth. There are a great many periodicals transmitted by post in all directions through the Commonwealth that come here in bulk, and act to a very great extent to the detriment of our journalists, printers, and publishers. They only pay the ordinary postage from our ports to the different parts of the Commonwealth. In the interests of our own people I think something should be done to see that they pay double postage, or something of that kind, so that they can not go broadcast and injure what is being done here. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; that is what I am advocating at the present time. It would be more in the interests of the people of Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland, or West Australia, instead of banishing George Adams and allowing their people to send away the&gt; money out of their own State, to institute a. concern of that kind themselves, keep the money there, and give the people less opportunity of being fleeced. Most people will admit that it is almost impossible to get rid of the evil. If we establish an institution of that kind, what do we do ? We give the people an opportunity of dealing -with an institution in which they cannot but have confidence. Would there be any necessity for legislating against all these other swindles then? Not the slightest ! Because when the people knew they had a legitimate place to go to, these institutions would be forsaken and the people who run them would have to go to work, or carry on the same business in other parts of the world. Not tha't I would put a cent into these institutions, but there are thousands in the Commonwealth who will do it no matter how you restrict them. Look at Melbourne today. Go to Adelaide or any other of the States. It does not matter what laws they have passed to purify the State, there the evil still exists ! The more they do the worse it gets, and some senators have said it has broken out in a worse form and in places where it is more difficult to deal with. That is the reason why we should do as they have done in Denmark. There the people have some common sense. I do not know that they recognised gambling as an evil, but they recognised it was something they could not eradicate, and the result was that they established a State institution. It was only this morning I learnt that last year the income from that institution amounted to from £125,000 to £150,000. That a mount was spent in Denmark, not upon old-age pensions or anything of that kind, because in Denmark they have a system of old-age pensions ; but for the purpose of maintaining other institutions, such as homes' for incurables, infirmaries, and even theatres to give the people rational enjoyment. </para>

                        <para>- He is obliged to make it, but no one must object to it. Yet we, who have the power, or who are taking the power, to compel the skipper of a ship to provide a locker for postal matter on board his vessel, must not say to that skipper, " You cannot carry other than white men to work your ships," because we would be violating some of the laws of the nations of the earth, and we must not do it. The absurdity of the thing appears on the very surface of it. If we have power to say to a skipper - " You must provide a locker " - then we have power to say that his ship must be manned either by German, English, Chinese, Japanese, or anyone else. We can make it part of our contract with the masters of vessels. The Postmaster-General has said, and some other honorable senators have agreed with him, " Oh, we will put this in the contract." Do the contracts come before Parliament for ratification ? Cannot the Postmaster-General, if we pass this Bill, enter into these contracts without consulting us, if he likes, and is it not better for us, in the interests of that policy, that almost every senator has declared himself to be in favour of - the policy of a white Australia. - to make this provision in the Bill? Almost every senator has travelled to all parts of the State, to declare himself in favour of a white Australia, and yet we here decline, or hesitate to put into this </para>

                <para>This great principle is that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are supreme ; that they control the constitution and laws of the respective States, and cannot be controlled, by them. From this, which may be almost termed an axiom, other propositions are deduced as corollaries, on the truth or error of which, and on their application to this case, the cause has been supposed to depend. These are - -1. That a power to create implies a power to preserve. 2. That a power to destroy, if wielded by a different hand, is hostile to, and incompatible with these powers to create and to preserve. 3. That where this repugnancy exists, that authority which is supreme must control, not yield, to that over which it is supreme. </para>
                <para>The court has bestowed on this subject its most deliberate consideration. The result is a conviction that the States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government. This is, we think, the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the constitution has declared. </para>

                        <para>- It is not much in point, but the clauses I have read are in point. It is impossible to suppose that we are in such a fix that the Post and Telegraph departments of the whole of the States having been transferred to the Commonwealth, we cannot compel the States to carry our mails over their railways, which practically is the only way of carrying them. If the Governments of New South Wales and South Australia, for example, were to say - " We do not care for your Act - we will not carry your mails between Melbourne and Sydney 'or Melbourne and Adelaide" does any one suppose that the High- Court would not follow the decision laid down in this case, and say that the States, having given over the entire control of the Postal department to the Commonwealth, were not bound to carry our mails ? </para>

                        <para>- It was necessary to make the transfer, in order to enable a Minister to be charged with the administration of the department, and to formulate a Bill and prepare his Estimates. These last three months have been months of great educational value, and certainly if the departments had not been transferred on the 1st March, there would have been no possibility of a Bill being presented to Parliament at this period. I thank honorable senators generally for the very kindly way in which they have treated the Bill, and I hope that, working together in committee, we shall be able to make it a really good measure. </para>

We have not got a chairman, and the difficulty is sought to be met by an amendment: Standing Order 287 says -

The difference between Standing Order 286 and Standing Order 285 is a very important one. In Standing Order 285 the motion is put from the Chair, but is not moved by any one.

                        <para>- Of course we are all anxious to get on with business. What is pointed out is that, by virtue of Standing Order 287, no other amendment on the question may be moved. It does not say that at all. It provides a means by which one can defeat a Bill, that is all. It is within a set of standing orders which provide for the disposal of a Bill which comes before the Senate. One may either move that the Bill be read a second time this day three months or this day six months, or if one does not do that then, on a motion to go into committee on the Bill, one may move that the House go into committee this day three months or this day six months, but it is not exhaustive of the amendments which can be moved on a motion of this kind - at least I should think not. I know of no authority for it. </para>

Of course if the Minister has to give notice he must give notice, but I venture to submit that he is perfectly in order in moving it as an amendment on the question to go into committee of the whole on the Bill, otherwise I submit that the President will have to take the chair. </para>

                    (Queensland).- While entirely agreeing with you, sir, that strictness should not operate to our disadvantage in carrying on the conduct of public business, at the same time I think there is a very grave question to be considered by honorable senators in accepting this amendment. As a Senate, we have not yet decided whether we shall have a Chairman of Committees ; and I think until we decide that question we ought to be particularly careful about appointing a temporary chairman, whether it is for one hour or for twelve hours, for one sitting or for twelve sittings.

                        <para>- Will the honorable senator take his seat ! I would point out to the Senate that this is not a question of the appointment of a Chairman of Committees. We have got a standing order which provides that Bills shall be referred to a committee of the whole. If they are referred to a committee somebody must be chairman. I understood myself not that there was to be a Chairman of Committees appointed, but that somebody was to temporarily take the chair. That must be so, but who the individual shall be is another question. </para>

                (Tasmania). - As I am slightly interested, inasmuch as I am taken from the floor of the Senate to be put in the chair, a position which I do not desire to occupy, might I suggest that the remarks of
                are very much to the point. I think the Standing Orders Committee have been restrained in making an interim report in reference to the appointment of Chairman of Committees, because of an understanding, or a promise made or implied, that we should appoint no permanent chairman until the permanent report had been brought up. We sat for two hours today and we find that we can only meet once a week if the Senate sits on Friday mornings, so that it may be a month or six weeks before the report on the standing orders can be brought up. As I have no wish to occupy the chair for more than a night or two, 1 should like to know whether we can get instructions from the Senate that, the Standing Orders Committee shall bring up an interim report. I understand that the committee is in favour by a majority of five to one of appointing a permanent Chairman of Committees, and if this instruction is given, we can settle the question to-morrow.

                        <para>- Very well; if the Senate desires it. The first clause requires that blanks shall be filled up providing for the date on which the Act shall come into operation. I left those blanks because I was doubtful how long it would take to get the Bill passed by Parliament. I am in hopes that it will go through the other Chamber pretty quickly, and I think it is possible that it will be brought into operation on the 1st October next. That will be exactly six months after the transfer of the department. My inclination at one time was to make it commence from the 1st January next, but I think it is desirable that we should get it into operation as soon as we can. We shall require, of course, a small margin to enable the necessary preparations to be made. I move - </para>

                        <para>- There will be a considerable amount of discussion upon this clause. I have no objection if the Senate desires to go on for a little time, but I hope we will not sit late. I am not speaking on my own account at all, because 1 have some other business to attend to after the House rises. I do not ask for any concession for myself, but perhaps it may be profitable, as there are some honorable senators who desire to have a discussion upon this clause, for us to go on for a quarter of an hour or so. I do not think we can possibly settle the clause this evening, because it is upon this clause that the question of the power of fixing rates should be discussed, seeing that it refers to the Governor-General, who has the power to fix them. I would just like to say as a guide to members that it is a mistake to suppose that the Postmaster-General is desirous of getting a large amount of power into his hands. He recognises that additional powers always bring additional responsibilities. I would ask honorable senators not to take the view that some seem to have taken during the discussion, that the Postmaster-General is exceedingly desirous of getting all sorts of powers, a sort of insinuation being made that he wants to get these powers in order to use them tyranically. Those who use these arguments present all the advantages that the adoption of their view would bring about. It is the natural infirmity of all minds that they do not lay any stress upon the disadvantages, but I always try to present the disadvantages as well as the advantages. Honorable senators who object to the clause may see that even from their point of view there may be some disadvantage in taking this power of fixing rates out of the hands of the Governor-General. The practice has been different in the different States. In Victoria, for instance, the rates have been fixed by Act of Parliament, with the result that they cannot be altered except by Act of Parliament. In other States the rates can be altered by the Governor in </para>
