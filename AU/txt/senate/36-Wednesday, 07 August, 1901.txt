          <para>- I have with regret to announce to the Senate that since its last meeting we have heard from Europe of the demise of one of the daughters of our late lamented Queen Victoria, the Dowager Empress of Germany, who was a good friend to England, the land of her birth. Her death, I am sure, we all deeply deplore, not only for our own sake, hut also for the sake of her relatives, amongst whom is included her brother, His Majesty the King of England. </para>

          <para>. - I think it will be gratifying to the Senate to know that there will be placed on its records an expression of the feeling of deep regret with which the news just announced has been received, and of sympathy with His Majesty the King in the loss he has sustained. There are, I have no doubt, some honorable senators whose memories may go back to the time when the Princess Royal of England was betrothed to the Crown Prince of Prussia, afterwards the Emperor Frederick. That alliance I think fulfilled the high expectations that were formed of it. It was the means of bringing into closer touch the people of two great nations of kindred origin. The influence of the Dowager Empress we may be perfectly sure, was at all times used in tha right direction, and I think I may say that in her court life she proved herself- to be a worthy daughter of the august lady whose memory we still mourn, Queen Victoria. If yesterday had been a sitting day I should have moved that the Senate adjourn, as a mark of respect and sympathy. The House of Representatives adjourned yesterday, and both Houses of the State Parliament also adjourned. I think now it will be fitting, and I am sure I am voicing the desires of honorable senators, that we should pass a resolution expressive of our regret and of our sympathy with His Majesty the King.

            <para>- I think the Government is very ill-advised in departing from its original intention. -My opinion is that the Senate has exhausted its duty by placing on its records its sense of the loss experienced by the death of the Dowager Empress of Germany. If we had been sitting in the ordinary course of things yesterday, I do not know that I should have offered any objection to an adjournment. </para>

            <para>- I have been speaking to the question all the time. Apparently the course I am taking is not agreeable to some honorable senators, but, as I have said, I am entitled to express my opinion clearly. When I look around the Senate I find that a number of honorable senators can get home at the end of every week. Those senators are by no means anxious that the business of the country should go on. They are, apparently, much more anxious to get to their homes every Friday afternoon, coming back on Wednesday, than to see the business done for which the Commonwealth Parliament has been called together. </para>

            <para>- With all deference, I think I am confining myself to the question. I am pointing out the state of affairs which leads to what I call dawdling in the transaction of the business of the Commonwealth. A number of 'us are compelled to sit here constantly, while another section of the Senate can go home at the end of every week. That section is continually hindering public business. This running home week after week means that some senators have to wait here until it suits the convenience of others to come back and attend to their duties. I enter my protest against the adjournment, and will oppose every such adjournment on every occasion. </para>
