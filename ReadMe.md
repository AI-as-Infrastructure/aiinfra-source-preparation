This repository contains source documents for the [AI as Infrastructure (AIINFRA)](aiinfra.anu.org.au) project, comprising Hansard documents from the year 1901. ReadMe files are provided for each of the three corpuses: Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

This repository is only a _working repo_, containing Python code used to prepare the sources for publication in the [primary project source repository](https://github.com/AI-as-Infrastructure/aiinfra-source). It is retained here to support methodological transparency.
