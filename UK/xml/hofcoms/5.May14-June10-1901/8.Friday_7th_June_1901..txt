<title>MILITARY CONVICTS&#x2014;CONFINEMENT<lb/> IN CIVIL PRISONS.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03541"><member>MR. LAMBERT <memberconstituency>(Devonshire, South Molton)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether any men convicted of military offences in South Africa are in civil convict prisons; whether any sentences have been passed by which such men are herded with ordinary convicts and felons; if so, will he state the number of men upon whom such punishments are inflicted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03542"><member>MR. SPEAR <memberconstituency>(Devonshire, Tavistock)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will at the same time say if there are any men from the front in South Africa committed to Dartmoor prison for sleeping while on duty; and, if so, could he recommend some less severe form of punishment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03543"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: Some men convicted of military offences in South Africa are in civil convict prisons, where they are classified as, and associated with, civil first offenders. I have no information to show the exact number of soldiers so placed, but thirty-one men found guilty of sleeping on their posts are confined in convict prisons. The question of segregating military prisoners is at present under consideration. Sleeping on duty on active service is an offence of great gravity, as it endangers many lives, and has in the present campaign been the cause of surprise and loss of several posts. It therefore, by military law, subjects the offender to the penalty of death. Two men in South Africa have been sentenced to death, but the death penalty has been commuted by Lord Kitchener to penal servitude. In other cases sentences of penal servitude or imprisonment have been given. The Commander-in-Chief is at present considering these cases individually, and the hon. Member may rest assured that wherever leniency can be properly shown a mitigation of punishment will
<image src="S4V0094P0I0780"/>
<col>1317</col>
be ordered. I am not aware how many of such offenders are confined in Dartmoor Prison, as the distribution is arranged by the Home Office, but the question of the segregation of prisoners convicted of military offences from others is being considered.</membercontribution></p>

This has been done partly by absorbing all vacancies, partly by transferring employees elsewhere, principally to Ireland. With regard to the second paragraph of the question, the existing practice is that the railway and steamboat fares of the wives and children of all married assistants of twelve years service are paid from

<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS-PLACING<lb/> IN THE LIBRARY&#x2014;EXPEDITING<lb/> HANSARD REPORT.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03642"><member>MR. HERBERT LEWIS</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether, in view of the difficulty of hearing the replies to questions, and having regard to the delay in receiving proofs of questions and answers, and the repetition, partly arising from such delay, of questions which have already been asked, and for the general convenience of Members, arrangements will be made to file in the Library copies of questions which appear on the Notice Paper, and the replies to such questions, until the <i>Hansard</i> Reports containing such questions and answers have been placed in the hands of Members. In asking this
<col>1332</col>
question perhaps I may say, in regard to the official reports, that I make no imputation or suggestion whatever against the contractors, who are fulfilling the terms of their contract.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03643"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: The last statement of the hon. Gentleman is perfectly true&#x2014;that the contract time for publication is always kept. As to the suggestion contained in the hon. Member's question, there would be, I believe, great difficulty, if not almost impossibility, in carrying it into effect. Some of the most important questions are about matters of which no notice is given, and in such cases I do not think it would be practicable to adopt the plan the hon. Gentleman recommends. The only method of meeting his views would, I think, be to devise some system by which the publication of <i>The Parliamentary Debates</i> would be expedited; otherwise, I think the hon. Member must depend on the reports which appear in the newspapers. Let me, however, say that all my colleagues, without exception, will only be too glad to give any Member who has asked them a question and has not caught the answer, a full statement in writing of what they have said in the House. I do not think I can add anything to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03644"><member>MR. HERBERT LEWIS</member><membercontribution>: I am very much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the reply he has given, but, arising out of it, may I ask whether it has been brought to his notice that in the Canadian Parliament reports of each sitting are furnished to Members on the following morning, although the House frequently sits till two or three or four o'clock?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03645"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: I was not aware of the fact till the hon.

<title>REVENUE DEPARTMENTS ESTIMATES,<lb/> 1901&#x2013;2.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03667">1. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;1,221,713, be granted to His Majesty to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1902, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Inland Revenue Department."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03668"><member>MR. HERBERT LEWIS <memberconstituency>(Flint Boroughs)</memberconstituency></member> moved a reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;100 in respect to Item A. He said that his object was to draw the attention of the Government to the very large number of claims for rebatement of income tax. This question was much more important now because the income tax had increased to a very large extent. Naturally, in the past, there were a very large number of people who never troubled to make claims for rebatements. He did not wish to make the slightest imputation against the officials concerned, but he would say that a large number of people with small incomes found great difficulty in obtaining the rebates of income tax to which they were entitled. Many of these people were not accustomed to business, and they required to be treated with a great deal of attention and courtesy. The surveyors of taxes had undoubtedly in the past been overdriven, and he did not know of any body of civil servants who had had such a hard time of it within the last few years as the surveyors of taxes. What he wished the hon. Gentleman to do was to give specific instruction to all the officers concerned that they should afford all the aid they
<col>1336</col>
possibly could to persons of small incomes. After all, those people were entitled to the money. All he wanted was that the officials should help these people as far as possible to obtain the rebatements to which they were entitled, and to help them to get such rebatements with as little trouble as possible. His second point was in reference to the Special Commissioners of Income Tax. He wished to know why a man who had to appear before the Special Commissioners of Income Tax was not allowed to have legal assistance, or anyone else to speak on his behalf. There were a number of persons who appealed to the Special Commissioners who had not had the necessary training to put their cases properly before these Special Commissioners, and he wished to know why that legal assistance was not allowed them. He noticed under this heading a number of references to the Land Tax Commissioners. Thousands of Commissioners of Land Tax had been appointed who had never heard of a single meeting for the election of the Commissioners of Income Tax, and they had not the least idea where the meetings would be held. If they wished to know they would have to subscribe regularly to the official <i>Gazette</i>. Ordinary people had not the time to read the official <i>Gazette</i>, and it seemed to him to be a most extraordinary thing that the Commissioners of Land Tax did not receive proper notice as to when and where such meetings would be held. He felt so strongly upon this last point that he begged leave to move the reduction of Item A by &#x00A3;100, and he did so in the hope that the hon. Gentleman would give him such an assurance on the point as would justify him in withdrawing his motion.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03669">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That Item A (Salaries) be reduced by &#x00A3;100."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Herbert Lewis.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03670"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. CORRIE GRANT <memberconstituency>(Warwickshire, Rugby)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he wished to call attention to the position of surveyors of taxes and to the necessity for the creation of more new districts in the great centres of industry and commerce. In the year 1900 the hon. Member for the Horsham Division of Sussex called the attention of the present President of the Board of
<image src="S4V0094P0I0790"/>
<col>1337</col>
Agriculture to this matter, and the right hon. Gentleman admitted that the surveyors of taxes were overworked and that new districts were required. Some attempt had been made to deal with the matter since. There had been a recasting of the divisions and a new class had been created. He believed that under the new pressure with regard to the income tax it would be desirable in the great cities that the work in connection with Schedule D should be allotted to surveyors of long experience and training. He put forward the suggestion not alone on the ground that the present surveyors were overworked, but with a view of realising income out of the increase in the number of surveyors. A considerable amount of income tax was recovered by the efforts of those gentlemen, and an increase in the number would be a paying concern, because it would bring in a far greater return than the amount expended on the salaries of new surveyors. With regard to assistant surveyors, he wished to know whether there was a sufficient number of juniors in existence at present to provide for all the necessities of the service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03671"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON <memberconstituency>(Newington, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> pointed out that owing to the starvation, so to speak, of the staff of surveyors the country was suffering a considerable loss. It was admitted that the amount of labour imposed upon the surveyors had very largely increased. This operated very harshly against those in receipt of small incomes who required to take steps in order to get the rebate to which they were entitled. He knew that from his own experience of one particular class&#x2014;namely, Government officials, Army and Navy officers, and others. Many of that class, owing to their want of knowledge in connection with this question, failed to receive back that to which they were entitled. If a proper staff of duly qualified assessors, not overworked, were appointed, cases of hardship like that would be dealt with, and the injustice now done to this class might be obviated. He did not wish to say anything derogatory of the great class of people who were engaged in commercial and mercantile pursuits, but it was well known that they did not pay
<col>1338</col>
as closely and accurately upon their incomes as those who were in receipt of small fixed incomes, and, therefore, owing to this fact, naturally a larger proportion of the tax fell upon those who received small fixed incomes, inasmuch as a greater increase in the tax was required because a certain amount which ought to be obtained was not realised. He hoped the hon. Gentleman would see to the increasing of the staff in order that, in justice to those who were drawing the smaller incomes and the ratepayers generally, the full amount that ought to be realised was obtained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03672"><member>MR. SPEAR <memberconstituency>(Devonshire, Tavistock)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> hoped the Government would not yield to the advice of the hon. Member for West Newington to increase the staff of surveyors. He had been an Income Tax Commissioner for years, and he was bound to say that he thought the staff in the part from which he came was abundant. The hon. Member for West Newington thought a considerable amount might be derived from the income tax if there was a larger number of surveyors. His own experience was that a good many men paid income tax who really ought not to do so. The surveyors at present were in the habit&#x2014;he did not wish to speak in a derogatory way of them&#x2014;of guessing men's incomes and causing them the inconvenience of appearing before the Commissioners, a process which was extremely unpleasant in many instances.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03673"><member>MR. POWER <memberconstituency>(Waterford, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the complaint made in England with regard to the repayments to which people were entitled in connection with the income tax applied with particular force in Ireland. He knew many cases in which people of limited means preferred to pay the demand made upon them rather than go to the worry of filling up the form which had to be sent to the surveyor of taxes. He complained that the clerks of the income tax department had no status whatever, and he thought that, in the interest of the payers of the tax and in the interest of the community at large, some sort of status should be given to them on account of the most delicate work they had to carry on. Fifteen years ago he asked a question
<image src="S4V0094P0I0791"/>
<col>1339</col>
on this subject and got a soft answer, but nothing had been done. He asked whether nothing could be done to simplify the forms in the first instance, and also the procedure which had to be gone through in asking for a rebate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03674"><member>MR. LOUGH <memberconstituency>(Islington, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said a Return was issued lately showing the dates at which the people of the three kingdoms paid their income tax, and it had puzzled him very much. The Return gave the figures for three years, but as they were almost the same in each he would only mention the last of the three. In England 32 per cent. was paid by the end of January, and 53 per cent. by the end of February. The figures were about the same for Ireland. About one half came in during March. In Scotland by 31st January 77 per cent. was paid, and by 28th February no less than 93 per cent. was paid. He asked if the Secretary to the Treasury could give any explanation of the fact that Scotland paid a so much larger proportion of the income tax in advance than either England or Ireland, and whether there was any legal right to collect the tax before 31st March. He would also like, if the hon. Gentleman could give it, information as to the number of joint-stock companies registered during the present year, and as to the seizures for illicit distillation. There were twelve such seizures in England, five in Scotland, and no fewer than 1,828 in Ireland. The Treasury ought to be able to throw some light on the extraordinary figures for Ireland. Was the large number of seizures due to the employment of the constabulary in this extra police duty, and were the constabulary paid a special fee for each seizure?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03675"><member>MR. LLOYD-GEORGE <memberconstituency>(Carnarvon Boroughs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> called attention to the mode of appointing Income Tax Commissioners. Once in each Parliament an Act was passed prescribing the method by which the Commissioners were to be appointed. The appointment was in the hands of the Land Tax Commissioners. The clerks were supposed to summon the Commissioners for the purpose of appointing Income Tax Commissioners, but, as a matter of fact, they never did so. He asked who it was that took upon them-
<col>1340</col>
selves to override the Act of Parliament which directed that the Commissioners should be summoned. Was it the clerks, acting upon their own initiative, because they did not like the Act, or was it done under the authority of a Treasury Minute? In either case, the Act was set at defiance, and the Committee were entitled to some explanation of the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03676"><member>THF FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, <memberconstituency>Worcestershire, E.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said, with regard to the question raised by the hon. Member for Flint, he thought the difficulties which poor people experienced in securing the repayments of income tax to which they were entitled arose in the majority of cases from the fact that they were people unaccustomed to business, and to whom the simplest form&#x2014;and from the nature of the case these forms could not always be simple&#x2014;would present some difficulties. The officers of the Inland Revenue who had to examine these claims had thrown upon them an enormous amount of detailed trouble owing to the imperfect form in which the claims were made; but the claims were examined with all possible despatch, and he hoped and believed that they were dealt with with perfect courtesy and the desire that every citizen should come by what was his due. He had had a little experience of making up returns for other people, and he would bring the suggestion of the hon. Member to the notice of the Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue. If there was any reason to suppose that any officers were dealing with the claimants uncivilly, or throwing unnecessary difficulties in their way, he was quite certain that the Board of Inland Revenue would be the first people to desire to put a stop to it. He did not think it was possible to simplify the forms which had to be filled up; but if the hon. Member had any suggestion to make on that subject he would be glad to lay it before the Board of Inland Revenue. Such complications as existed were inherent to the subject itself rather than to the, particular form chosen. The hon. Member for Flint had asked why people who appeared before the Special Commissioners were not allowed legal assistance. The Special Commissioners
<image src="S4V0094P0I0792"/>
<col>1341</col>
were not themselves legal gentlemen, and he was inclined to think that it would not be in the interest of those who appeared before the Special Commissioners that they should have legal assistance. It was not a formal court, and it was better for all concerned that the proceedings should be kept as informal as possible.<lb/>
The hon. Gentleman had asked him what steps were taken to summon meetings of the Land Tax Commissioners, and had demanded that he should pledge himself that in every case individual notice should be sent to each Commissioner. All the obligations of the law were fulfilled by the publication in the <i>Gazette</i> of notices of the meetings, and it could hardly be expected that the <i>Gazette</i> notice would not be seen, and that individual notices should be sent out at the same time. Unless there was some real object to be gained by a change, he thought it was undesirable, because it would involve a great deal of trouble and labour. If the hon. Member would tell him what special difficulties there were in the present system he would be glad to meet him and discuss the matter with him.<lb/>
The hon. and gallant Member for Newington had raised a question in regard to the staff. The hon. Member, as he understood him, maintained that the staff was over-worked, that the number of surveyors was too few, and that it ought to be increased. These questions were undoubtedly connected, but perhaps not in the way the hon. Member seemed to think. Something like twenty districts and new surveyors had been added, and in order to secure a sufficient number of experienced officers they had been obliged to suspend the superannuation rule. This was not done in the interest of the gentlemen on the staff, but in the interest of the Service and of the public; and he was hopeful that before the Vote was discussed again the rule would be once more enforced. He trusted, however, that the hon. Member would not press him to say at what particular date the rule would be enforced. It was the duty of the Board of Inland Revenue to consider what was necessary for carrying on their labours to the best advantage, and also not to create unnecessary posts, or to spend money which
<col>1342</col>
might otherwise be saved. The hon. Gentleman had asked him about assistant surveyors. He did not think it was desirable to have a very large class of assistant surveyors, and he would be sorry to see that body increased to a large extent. That increase of the staff had been urged on the ground that it would lead to a closer collection of the income tax, but he thought the remedy for any attempt to avoid payment was to be found in other directions; and he hoped as time went on they would get a closer collection of what was due than now existed.<lb/>
The hon. Member for West Islington had asked the question&#x2014;of which he would have liked some notice, in order to fully deal with it&#x2014;as to the closer collection of the income tax in Scotland than in other parts of the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for East Edinburgh had moved for a Return in regard to the collection of the income tax in different parts of the Kingdom. That would involve the Treasury in considerable expense, but he would endeavour to see whether the Return could be made. The closer collection of the income tax in Scotland was due, he believed, to the habits of the Scottish people, who had a desire to meet their obligations the moment they became due. That was most creditable to them, but he also thought it was not because the Scotch were more really anxious to pay their income tax than the people in England, or even Ireland, but because what was known as the official threatening letter was sent out more promptly in Scotland than in England or Ireland. As the tax was a heavy one this year, the circumstances of its collection should not be made more stringent than usual.<lb/>
The hon. Member also asked some explanation in regard to the rewards paid for the seizure of illicit stills in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, and to whom these rewards were paid. There was not the same temptation to the illicit distillation of spirits in England and Scotland as in Ireland. The hon. Member did throw out the suggestion that the Returns were corrected. He did not profess that he had looked into this question very closely, but he would make inquiries into the matter. He, however, could not imagine that the
<image src="S4V0094P0I0793"/>
<col>1343</col>
Returns were false intentionally. The rewards were payable in all the divisions of the United Kingdom mainly to the police or the revenue officers who had been instrumental in the detection of frauds on the revenue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03677"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution> asked whether the police were entrusted with this duty in any part of the United Kingdom except in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03678"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said that the police were not employed in this matter so much in the United Kingdom as in Ireland. In England and in Scotland the duty fell more on the Inland Revenue officers than on the police, which in Ireland were in closer connection with the Government. The amount of the rewards paid depended on special circumstances. In the great majority of cases they were small rewards of 6s. or 10s., but in special circumstances the amount was as much as &#x00A3;2 or &#x00A3;3.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03679"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR JOSEPH LEESE <memberconstituency>(Lancashire, Accrington)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked the Financial Secretary to the Treasury whether, when the conference with some honourable Members which he had promised took place, he would consider the manner in which the election of the Income Tax Commissioners was made when vacancies occurred after the first appointment. He was afraid that although a technical statutory obligation might be fulfilled when vacancies occurred, there had been, in recent years, a system of co-optation, which seemed to him to be a direct violation of the statute, and he hoped that the system by which these Commissioners elected themselves would not be allowed to go on. He had a case in his mind which when vacancies occurred persons only approved by the remaining members of the Commission had the slightest chance of election. Contrary to all enactment and practically subversive of Parliamentary intention, these bodies of Income Tax Commissioners were gradually becoming "close boroughs." He rejoiced to think that a conference with the Financial Secretary might restore the elective methods and destroy the present ones, which are practically co-optative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03680"><member>MR. RENSHAW <memberconstituency>(Renfrew, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> thought that the Scotch people would
<col>1344</col>
consider the Income Tax Return a very useful Return. He was perfectly aware of the fact that one of the reasons why the income tax was paid so promptly in Scotland was because, when the Return was made, a notice was immediately sent out to say if payment was not made in fourteen days unpleasant proceedings would take place. That practice had not been observed in either England or Ireland, and the sooner the practice of the collection of the income tax in those countries was brought up to the level of the Scotch practice the better.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03681"><member>MR. THOMAS SHAW <memberconstituency>(Hawick Burghs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he thought the Return would be a most useful document. The suggestion was that Scotland had displayed undue virtue in the payment of this tax, but after explanation it was discovered that this duty was actually due on the 1st of January. What Scotland wanted to know was not why she should be made to pay on the nail, but why England and Ireland should be placed upon a different plane. What did the Government propose to do when this Return brought home the fact, as he was informed, that there was an actual loss to the revenue of &#x00A3;30,000 per annum, owing to the income tax not being promptly collected when it was due. He wished for some explanation as to what the Government's attitude was going to be in regard to this matter. Was the House to be content with the proposition that the income tax, which was due on 1st January, was to be paid in the month of March? Would it not be better for the Government to say that the practice in Scotland was a better practice, and to see that the example of Scotland was followed south of the Tweed and in Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03682"><member>MR. BRIGG <memberconstituency>(Yorkshire, W.R., Keighley)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he supported the hon. Member who moved the reduction on the grounds of economy. He also wished the Financial Secretary would inquire into the cost of collection of the excise and customs duties devoted to technical education. A very large amount might be saved in the collection of these duties if the different localities were allowed to collect their own amounts. Under the present system, these duties were collected and the money sent to London, and
<image src="S4V0094P0I0794"/>
<col>1345</col>
thence was returned to the different localities. The reason he drew attention to this matter was that the cost of collection of taxes was one of the largest items of expenditure they had to deal with in the matter of Inland Revenue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03683"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES <memberconstituency>(Lynn Regis)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he wished to call attention to some petty and irritating annoyances from which the public suffered in connection with the collection of establishment licences. He thought he would be able to show that the method of the collection of these taxes was an excessively disagreeable method, and he hoped that reconsideration would be given to the matter. What he objected to was that at the commencement of the year one was called upon to make a return of carriages and horses and men-servants, etc., in one's establishment, and then if a man removed for a short time he was called upon to make a separate return. That was not a right method. Once a return was made to the central office, that should be sufficient. Only a short time ago, having paid upon his servants and dogs in the early part of the year, he had received a sort of threatening letter from the Inland Revenue suggesting he had more menservants and more dogs than he paid for. As a matter of fact, he had paid licences for four men-servants and four dogs; but one of the dogs got lost and one of the men-servants, having had a difference with the under-footman over the housemaid, had left, and he had only three men-servants and three dogs, and not only could he get no return for the money which he had overpaid, but there was this suspicion on the part of the Inland Revenue that he kept more dogs and men-servants than he paid for. What he complained of was a want of proper inter-communication between the central office and the subservient officials.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03684"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he desired to call attention to the extraordinary figures given in the Inland Revenue Returns regarding the seizures of illicit spirits in Ireland and Scotland. As an Irishman he should protest against the manner in which the figures were given, without a word of explanation.
<col>1346</col>
According to the Returns referred to, there were only five cases of illicit distillation in Scotland, while in Ireland it was said there were 1,826. Anyone reading the Return as it was presented to the House would imagine, if he did not know the real circumstances, that the whole population of Ireland was engaged in illicit distillation of spirits. An explanation of these figures was absolutely necessary. Some information was also desirable regarding the proceeds from this enormous number of seizures in Ireland. If penalties were recovered and sales effected, a very considerable sum must have been realised. Where was the account of that money, and how were the rewards given, and, in cases where the action of the police was recognised by the Inland Revenue authorities, who fixed the amount of the rewards? On these points some detailed information ought to be given. From his experience in the west of Ireland, he had a strong suspicion that there was something very extraordinary about these Returns. He did not believe there had been 1,826 <i>bona fide</i> seizures, and he would like to know was there anything going on in the nature of bogus seizures?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03685"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution> said that the answer given by the Secretary to the Treasury with regard to the seizure of illicit stills in Ireland was not at all satisfactory, and a strong protest ought to be made. Some explanation certainly ought to be given of the figures which had been put before the House. For his part he thought that the fact of there being 1,826 seizures in Ireland showed the tremendous pressure of the whisky tax in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03686"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said he must admit that the figures appeared rather extraordinary, but it should be remembered that in Scotland the seizures used to be far greater than they are now, and that the illicit distillation trade was almost stopped owing to the great risks accompanying it. He would inquire as to the reason for the large number of seizures in Ireland, and as regards the rewards given to the police; the amount in all cases was fixed by the Inland Revenue authorities, according
<image src="S4V0094P0I0795"/>
<col>1347</col>
to the circumstances of each case. The value of what was seized was in the great majority of cases very small.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03687"><member>MR. HERBERT LEWIS</member><membercontribution> said the replies which he had received were of such a satisfactory character that he did not think he would be justified in dividing the House. He therefore begged leave to withdraw his Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03688">Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03689">Original Question again proposed.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03690"><member>MR. WHITLEY <memberconstituency>(Halifax)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said there were several matters connected with this Vote which merited attention. The first matter to which he wished to call attention would be found on reference to page 25 of the Votes. He alluded to the great increase in the cost of the Estate Duty Office staff, first in the appointment of a Government staff of assistant secretaries; then the appointment of a new examiner of wills, the appointment of an assistant examiner of wills, the appointment of four first class clerks, the appointment of nine new second division clerks, and the appointment of six new assistant clerks. He thought such a great increase as that in the staff of a particular department ought to have an explanation from the mover of the Vote before the Committee were asked to go to a division upon it. On the next page of the Votes&#x2014;page 26&#x2014;there was an effort which, if intended to secure economy, did not realise it. In the Accountant and Comptroller General's Office there was a decrease of six in the number of second division clerks. That would appear to show that the Department was overstaffed, but at the same time there was an increase of seven in the division clerks of higher grade, at a salary of &#x00A3;100 more than that of the six clerks who had been dispensed with. He hoped the Financial Secretary, to the Treasury would give a proper explanation of that item before the Vote was passed. The third matter that he had to bring before the Committee was on page 29, and it was exactly similar to that to which he drew attention last night on the War Office Vote, when the noble Lord
<col>1348</col>
in charge of the Vote (Lord Stanley) admitted an irregularity and promised that it should not occur again. He noticed that in the Stamping Department there were four newly-appointed clerks, whose salaries, as given in the maximum and minimum columns, amounted to &#x00A3;94 more than they were entitled to receive on the face of the Vote. He took this opportunity to protest against that difference in the scale. He noticed that two senior messengers were described in the Vote as "redundant." When an officer was said to be redundant he supposed it meant that he was not wanted, or that there was no work for him to do in his department. The future strength of the messengers would' be three less than at present, the number being seven, so that three were redundant. This he regarded as a waste of money, and it showed that messengers and clerks had not got full work to do, and this always had a demoralising effect upon the working of any department. Persons in that position were only waiting for their pensions without having full employment. Then he noticed that there was a proposal to reduce the payments of the charwoman from 12s. to 10s. 6d. a week. He thought that the wages of the charwoman ought to have been left as they were, while the two messengers should have been removed, and their salaries of &#x00A3;100 each saved by the Treasury. He would be satisfied if the Secretary of the Treasury gave a pledge that these matters would be inquired into, and that such anomalies would not recur in future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03691"><member>MR. RENSHAW</member><membercontribution> said the Circular dated December, 1900, in which new regulations were laid down in respect of the appointment of surveyors and land valuation assessors in Scotland, would alter the system which had hitherto obtained. He was of opinion that the system which had been adopted for years past by the Inland Revenue for the appointment of these officials should be continued. The effect of the new regulations would be to get a worse class of officials, whereas it was in the interest of the public that the best class of persons who could be obtained should be appointed to these duties. He thought the result
<image src="S4V0094P0I0796"/>
<col>1349</col>
of the new regulations, if put into force, would be very undesirable. Arrangements should be made by which the Board of Inland Revenue might receive representations from the Scottish authorities in respect of this matter, and he hoped an assurance would be given that the effect of the new rules would not be to give Scotland an inferior class of official to discharge the responsible duties which had hitherto been so effectively discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03692"><member>MR. CALDWELL <memberconstituency>(Lanarkshire, Mid)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the matter which had just been referred to had been under his observation, but he quite admitted it required to be gone into in greater detail than was possible under this Vote. With regard to the collection of the income tax, seeing that the financial year was from 31st March to 31st March, it seemed to him that the tax should be collected in the month of January, so that it would be paid well within the year. The income tax was an Imperial tax, and ought to be collected all over the kingdom alike. Scotland, through paying at an earlier period than England and Ireland, was practically paying &#x00A3;30,000 a year more than her proper proportion as compared with the rest of the United Kingdom. That, obviously, was an injustice. He did not for a moment suggest that the payment in Scotland should be postponed, but if the tax was collected in England the same as in Scotland there would be a considerable saving to the Exchequer. Unless an assurance was given that the collection would be made in England in the month of January, as was done in Scotland, he should, as a protest, take the opinion of the Committee on the matter. He therefore moved to reduce the Vote by &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03693">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That Item A (Salaries) be reduced by &#x00A3;100."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Caldwell.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03694"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: The point raised by the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire is certainly one worthy of consideration, and if a proper representation of the case is made I have no doubt the Board of Inland Revenue will gladly listen to it and give it their careful consideration. The alterations
<col>1350</col>
in the staff, referred to by the hon. Member for Halifax, are in pursuance of the recommendations of a Departmental Committee presided over by the hon. Member for Haddington. The work of the Estate Duty Office has very largely increased of recent years in consequence of the increase of the death duties. I suppose there are few Government departments which within the last ten years have not been the subject of very careful inquiry as to the numbers and the classes of the staffs, but no office has any power to increase its staff without Treasury sanction. Each case is carefully examined on its merits, and while we naturally feel that if an office is understaffed the work cannot be done properly, still we are anxious to prevent any unreasonable or unnecessary growth of staff. With regard to the clerks spoken of as "redundant," the same point was raised two or three weeks ago, and I hoped I had made the matter clear to the hon. Member. It simply means that in the course of reorganisation or inquiry it has been decided that for the permanent requirements of the office an official of a particular grade at present there is not required. If a second division clerk is to be substituted for a higher division clerk, the higher division clerk at present engaged would be indicated in the Estimates as "redundant," so that Members might have it before them that that is a post to be abolished on a vacancy occurring, or that it is to be filled by an officer of a lower grade. The officer is redundant not in the sense that there is no work for him to do, but only in the sense that an officer of his particular grade is not required for the work. If we did not have him we should have to have a clerk of a lower grade. It is not economical to retire the more expensive officer on a pension and at the same time engage a clerk of a lower grade to do the work. It is better that the higher grade man should work out his time, but, of course, if he could usefully be transferred to another office he would be so transferred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03695"><member>MR. WHITLEY</member><membercontribution>: Is that ever done?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03696"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: Oh, yes; but, of course, it can only be done within limits. A man who has served in a particular office for a number of
<image src="S4V0094P0I0797"/>
<col>1351</col>
years has probably acquired skill or knowledge which makes him more useful in that office than he would be in another. The hon. Member for Mid Lanark has again called attention to the collection of the income tax. I quite agree that it is desirable that all parts of the United Kingdom should be treated alike in this matter and the pressure applied equally on all. I think, however, that with the long practice which has grown up in this country, and with, as I believe, though I am unable to give the reference at the moment, something like a Parliamentary pledge on the subject, it would be very difficult to enforce immediate collection of the income tax. Moreover, I do not think the time when that tax has just been raised to 1s. 2d. is the best moment to choose to be more exacting in its collection or more harassing in regard to it than we have been hitherto. With regard to the four clerks, the last item on page 29, they appear for the first time under that heading, but they are not new appointments; they have been transferred from another branch, and that is why the amount in the first column does not agree with the total of their minimum salaries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03697"><member>MR. THOMAS SHAW</member><membercontribution>: I have every desire to take any pledge that is given from the opposite Bench with regard to the collection of revenue, but I am not at all clear that any has been given on this subject. I understood the Financial Secretary to say that there were certain obstacles in the way of remedying the improper collection in England and Ireland on account of the long practice and a Parliamentary pledge. As to the long practice, is it or is it not in accordance with the law? The law with regard to the collection of this Imperial revenue is the same in all the three countries, and if there is a long practice which differentiates in favour of two countries as against the other one, the sooner it comes to an end the better. Then we are told that a Parliamentary pledge has been given upon the matter. We want to know what that pledge was. Was it that the practice of putting the law into force should be contrary to the letter of the law? If a bad practice, contrary to the letter of the law, is the subject of a Parliamentary pledge, why is not the
<col>1352</col>
law rectified so as to put on an equal footing the three countries of the United Kingdom? As regards the excuse of the time being inopportune for a change, that is altogether beside the point. The hon. Gentleman says that this is a time of a high income tax. Unfortunately it is. He says, further, that it is not a time to propose to extract it from the pockets of the taxpayers at an earlier period than has been the custom hitherto. That altogether misses the point. The result of this improper collection is to-deprive the Imperial revenue of &#x00A3;30,000 per annum. The higher the tax the greater the loss. Therefore, the argument of the tax being high is rather in favour of my contention that the sooner this bad and illegal or improper practice is brought to an end the better. It will be better in two respects: the practice will be brought into conformity with the law, and there will be a large gain to the revenue on account of a larger proportion of the tax being collected than has previously been the case. In order to test this question I would urge my hon. friend to press the matter to a division.<lb/>
With regard to the question referred to by the hon. Member for West Renfrewshire, I should recommend the hon. Member to rest satisfied with the pledge which has been given. There are two sets of parties aggrieved here. There are the assessors themselves, who fear that a new system is being introduced under which their interest is to be greatly prejudiced, and there are the county councils, the assessing bodies in Scotland which have hitherto been accustomed to take advantage of the excellent and well trained assessors for the purposes of the local assessments. In Scotland the system is such that the local assessments and the Imperial assessments are for the purposes of administration and valuation very closely interlocked, so that it is a hardship of which we are entitled to complain if this system is to be rashly disturbed. I understand, however, that a pledge has substantially been given that representations will be listened to with a not unfavourable ear, and I venture to prognosticate that, once these representations go to the proper quarter, there will be no doubt left in the minds of the officials at headquarters
<image src="S4V0094P0I0798"/>
<col>1353</col>
that the present system, which has worked to the advantage of both the Imperial and the local authorities in Scotland, should be maintained. There is no pledge that that will be the result. All we have is a pledge that the representations will be listened to, and with that I, for one, am satisfied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03698"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. WEIR <memberconstituency>(Ross and Cromarty)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> called attention to the following foot-note which appeared on page 36 of the Estimates:&#x2014;
<quote>"Certain Surveyors of Taxes in Scotland who are assessors under the Lands Valuation Act, and who have consequently to perform the duties of Registrars of Voters, receive various sums from local sources for their expenses and as remuneration for their services in preparing the voters rolls, register of county council electors, etc. According to the returns of those surveyors, the sums thus received by them for the year 1899&#x2013;1900 amounted in the aggregate to &#x00A3;6,056 8s. 5d., out of which they claim to have defrayed expenses to the amount of &#x00A3;1,453 19s. 4d., leaving &#x00A3;4,602 9s. 5d. as the nett personal emolument derived from such sources by eighteen surveyors."</quote>
From a calculation he had made he found that this amounted to about &#x00A3;255 each per annum. There was also an item of &#x00A3;3,000 for commuted allowances in lieu of poundage to assessors in Scotland. He did not object to the amount of money paid, but to the manner in which the work was done. There ought to be some better system of assessing the deer forests which were inadequately assessed. The poor people had to bear much heavier burdens than they ought to bear, in consequence of the very light assessment of the deer forests. There was only one assessor for the counties of Ross, Cromarty, and Inverness, and it was physically impossible for one man to discharge such onerous duties efficiently. He hoped the hon. Gentleman would look into this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03699"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: I will promise the hon. Member that I will make a full inquiry into the matter, although the information I have at present does not lead me to suppose that the assessor for Rossand the adjacent counties is overworked.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03700"><member>SIR WALTER FOSTER <memberconstituency>(Derbyshire, Ilkeston)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that with reference to the collection of the income tax in Scotland
<col>1354</col>
he congratulated the sister kingdom upon setting a good example to England. It was much to the credit of the Scotch income-tax payers, and also to the system of collection, that they had paid their taxes so promptly, for it gave great advantages to England. He thought the collection of the income tax in this country was done in a very slip-shod and unbusinesslike way, and the work was evidently done much better in Scotland. In England the collection of the income tax was sometimes allowed to drift even into the month of April, and that was a method which would not succeed in private affairs. He supported his hon. friend's motion for this reduction in the hope that the businesslike arrangement which had been so successful in Scotland would be introduced both in England and Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03701"><member>SIR JOHN LENG <memberconstituency>(Dundee)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he should like to know whether in future years the collection would be made in England simultaneously with Scotland. If not, he thought that Scotland would be entitled to a discount. It might be said that as the income tax was very high, the time to do this was inopportune at the present moment, but it was also inopportune for the people of Scotland to pay the income tax three months in advance of England. In several matters of this kind Scotland set England a good example, but England was always too tardy and unwilling to follow such good examples. It was about time something was done in this matter. The people of Scotland were quiet, modest, and amiable individuals, but they were now being put upon, and their very virtues were made to tell against them. Although they did their work better in Scotland, their officials were paid less for doing it than in England. He thought it was quite time that they showed a little more spirit, instead of permitting themselves to be punished and penalised for setting an example to England which England did not follow.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03704">Original Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03705">2. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;5,528,810, be granted to His Majesty, to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1902, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Post Office Services, and Expenses of Post Office Savings Banks, and Government Annuities and Insurances, and the Collection of the Post Office Revenue."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03706"><member>MR. BEYCE <memberconstituency>(Aberdeen, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I desire to address a question to the Secretary to the Treasury in regard to the delay in the building of the new post office at Aberdeen. This post office has been for a long time under the consideration of the Government, and the Vote which is proposed in this year's Estimate is but a small one. I am not going to enter into detail, but I wish to ask the hon. Gentleman representing the Post Office to press on this work, which is proceeding much too slowly. This is a question of much importance to my constituency, and I hope that next year a larger Vote will be taken, which will enable the work to proceed more rapidly. Owing to various causes the work has been so much delayed that the postal administration of Aberdeen is carried on under the greatest possible difficulties, and to the great inconvenience of the inhabitants
<col>1358</col>
of the district. Therefore, I am very anxious to obtain from the hon. Member representing the Post Office some assurance that next year steps will be taken to accelerate the work, and that in the meantime efforts will be made to secure the necessary accommodation to enable the postal work to be carried on better than at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03707"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR MARK STEWART <memberconstituency>(Kirkcudbrightshire)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> called attention to the increase of Sunday labour in the Post Office Department, and moved a reduction of the salary of the Postmaster General in order to bring before the House this question, which was one of great importance. This subject was not being brought before the House for the first time, for it was a question upon which very strong views were held by many persons who wished, as far as possible, to give a day of rest to those who were working in the Post Office. So long ago as the year 1864 this question was brought before the country by the Committee of the Working Men's Lord's Day Rest Association, who in 1864 commenced to agitate throughout the country for the reduction of Sunday labour in the Post Office Department. Since that date there had been a gradual increase in the numbers employed by the Post Office. In the year 1867 a Parliamentary Return was obtained by Sir Thomas Chambers, from which it was ascertained that at that time there were
<image src="S4V0094P0I0801"/>
<col>1359</col>
25,902 persons of all ranks employed in the postal service, of whom 20,961, or more than four-fifths, were at work on the Lord's Day. Since that time, as he had already said, there had been a vast increase in the new servants employed by the Post Office, and the number now employed by the Post Office amounted to about 41,000. He would pass on to the figures which he wished to quote as quickly as he could. In the year 1870 the late Sir Charles Reed, M.P. for Hackney, proposed to move in the House of Commons on the 5th of August the following resolution&#x2014;
<quote>"That the employment by the State of upwards of 20,000 persons in the Department of the Post Office on the Sabbath Day is not justified by any public necessity, and that, in the opinion of this House, it is desirable that the exemption from Sunday labour enjoyed by the letter carriers of London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Glasgow, and 114 other post towns, should be extended to all letter carriers and rural messengers throughout the United Kingdom."</quote>
This resolution did not come on in August, 1870, but Sir Charles Reed proposed his resolution in the House of Commons on the 18th of April, 1871, and Mr. Gladstone suggested in its place a resolution in the following terms, which was unanimously agreed to&#x2014;
<quote>"That this House deems it desirable to reduce by all prudent means the Sunday labour now performed by public servants, and that it is expedient that an official inquiry should be instituted with a view to ascertaining how far it may be practicable to effect a further reduction of the labour now performed on Sunday by the letter-carriers and rural messengers in the service of the Postmaster General."</quote>
A Commission was appointed to carry out this resolution, and it consisted of Lord Dalhousie, Sir George Grey, and the then Postmaster General, the Right Hon. W. Monsell. The cause advocated by Sir Charles Reed was supported by 2,103 petitions, with over 200,000 signatures. This Commission issued their Report in December, 1871, and the chief alterations they suggested were as follows&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(1) The abolition of a rural post on Sundays at the request of the persons who receive two-thirds of the correspondence, instead of, as formerly, at the request of those who received six-sevenths of the correspondence.</li>
<li>(2) A Sunday rural post not to be put on except at the request of the receivers of two-thirds of the correspondence of the district.</li>
<col>1360</col>
<li>(3) The providing of a substitute on alternate Sundays at an estimated expense to the department of &#x00A3;4,500 per annum for rural messengers who travel more than fourteen miles daily. (This distance has since been reduced to twelve miles daily.)</li>
<li>(4) The closing of town receiving offices on Sundays, one head office only remaining, open.</li>
</ol>
In 1887 a Select Committee was appointed to consider the whole question of Sunday labour in connection with the Post Office outside the metropolitan district. The Committee reported on the 10th of August that year and recommended (1) that the collection and despatch and the delivery on Sundays of books, circulars, and printed matter, other than newspapers, be discontinued, and (2) that the collection and despatch and the delivery of letters on Sunday be in future discontinued. The Committee went further, and recommended&#x2014;
<quote>"that the indoor duties of the Post Office service shall be so arranged as to relieve all sorting clerks and indoor officials so far as possible on alternate Sundays."</quote>
From a Parliamentary Return obtained in 1894 by the late Earl of Harrow by, in the House of Lords, it appeared that the total number of persons employed in the service of the Post Office in the. United Kingdom at that time was 136,447. The number at rest on Sundays was 95,173, and the number at work, 41,274. The number of those at, work on Sunday was thus shown by this Return to be more than double the number at work on Sundays in 1867, and this notwithstanding the resolution unanimously carried in the House of Commons in April, 1871. In 1899 another innovation was made with the best possible intention by the late Postmaster General. That was the establishment of the express delivery of letters in and around London on Sundays for a fee of 3d. per mile for each letter. Anyone receiving a letter ten miles off would have to pay 2s. 6d. That met with no favour on the part of the public, owing to the dearness of the delivery. In 1899 there were 71 special letters delivered in London, and last year the number was only 56. That practically was a proof of failure, and he could not say, personally, from the point of view he now took, that he regretted it.<lb/>
There were one or two matters her wanted specially to bring before the Finan-

<col>1361</col>
cial Secretary. He asked whether the service on Sunday was to be obligatory and compulsory That he thought was a very important matter. No doubt in the first instance all the Sunday work was done by volunteers. That was to say, men came from the outside to do the work and there was no compulsion whatever placed on the employees, but now, he believed the case was different. He believed that the present arrangement was adopted with good motives, possibly with the object of easing the labour and preventing men from being employed every Sunday, but he rather thought the policy of the Post Office now was to oblige the employees to work on Sunday. There was at one time a rule, made in April, 1898, that no man should work more than forty-eight hours per week without extra pay. If he worked on Sunday he got off so many hours on another day, or days, but now since March, 1900, he rather thought the rule was in desuetude, and the employees were obliged to work on Sundays; <i>i.e.</i>, they were engaged on the understanding that if they were called upon to work they were obliged to do so. It might be that they were only called upon to work once in every four or five Sundays, but his complaint was that under the old <i>regime</i> they were not obliged to work on Sunday at all. Since March, 1900, they were obliged, and he should like that point to be made as clear as possible to the House. He was satisfied that the general feeling would be that there ought to be no compulsion in a matter of this sort. It was a conscience matter with the men. Many of them had Sunday duties to perform, such as the teaching of Sunday-schools, and he was quite certain that the House of Commons would not stand for one moment between these men and their consciences. There were no doubt many others who would be quite willing to do the work prescribed for them.<lb/>
He trusted that the Committee would have a clear answer whether those men were or were not to be compelled to work on Sundays. A servant might be engaged to do certain work, and not necessarily to do other work, but if he was called upon to do that other work and refused, he might be told to go about his business. That was
<col>1362</col>
likely to be the case with the Post Office employees. The older servants might not actually be compelled, but if they did not do what they were bidden when the turn of Sunday duty came to them, then they had the option of leaving or working. The Post Office, being one of the largest employers of labour in the country, he thought that in the matter of Sabbath observance it should set a fair and right example. He was quite sure one of the greatest blessings this country had at the present time was the rest from secular work which Sunday afforded. If Members of Parliament agreed with him in that he was sure it would be their utmost desire to give to others in the Departments over which they had control and authority the same precious benefit. This country would never have come to its present commercial supremacy if it had not, observed one day of rest in seven. Other nations had tried to dispense with Sunday rest, but they had not succeeded. We worked fresher than the people of any other nation, and we did more work than any other nation on the face of God's earth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03708">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That Item A (Salaries) be reduced by &#x00A3;100, in respect of the Salary of the Postmaster General."&#x2014;(<i>Sir Mark Stewart.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03709"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON <memberconstituency>(Devonport)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he did not wish to draw a red herring across the debate and to divert attention from the subject to which the hon. Gentleman had just called attention. He entirely agreed with the hon. Member's contention, but he wanted to refer to another point before the Financial Secretary to the Treasury replied. It was a point in which he thought the Post Office were not showing themselves the sort of employers they ought to show themselves to be. It was not a very large point, but it was one which he knew from his own constituency was very considerably felt by the employees of the Post Office all over the country. The ordinary employees of the Post Office might be divided into two classes. There were the ordinary carriers, who did the work outside, and there were the men who, although they were of the same
<image src="S4V0094P0I0803"/>
<col>1363</col>
class and earned much about the same wages, were doing the clerical work and the work of stamping inside the Post Office. It had been the practice&#x2014;and the practice had been recognised by the authorities of the Post Office&#x2014;before 1st April, 1897, for postmen not only to expect gifts at Christmas and New Year's Day, but they were actually authorised to ask for Christmas boxes from those to whom they delivered letters. On 1st April, 1897, that practice was changed. The indoor men, as they are called&#x2014;those employed inside the Post Office, and who were, therefore, unable to ask for Christmas boxes, not being in a position to present themselves at the doors of those who probably would have been willing to give gifts&#x2014;received an allowance which was known technically in the Post Office as an allowance in lieu of Christmas boxes. It ranged from 2s. to 9s. a week. At the date named the allowances were abolished and the Christmas boxes were forbidden to be asked for. That was in accordance with the Tweedmouth Report. That system existed for a period of time&#x2014;he believed between 1st April and the middle of July of that year. Therefore, it would be seen that, inasmuch as it ceased to exist in the middle of July, there was no opportunity for it applying in the case of the outside men who previously were entitled to Christmas boxes. It was found, after further consideration, that it would be impossible to enforce the rule against inviting Christmas boxes, and by the middle of July the order was rescinded, and the men were allowed in the future as in the past to ask for Christmas boxes and New Year's gifts. That practice, therefore, received no interruption whatever as a matter of fact, but, at the, same time, the allowance of the indoor men of from 2s. to 9s. was not re-established. The particular point he wished to ask was this&#x2014;that the practice should be re-established according to the old calculation, and that there ought to be the same consideration given to the indoor men in lieu of the gifts, seeing that they could not obtain gifts at Christmas and New Year. He was informed that whereas previously there was no difficulty whatever in inducing outside men to do inside work, because the allowance was considered equivalent to their
<col>1364</col>
somewhat precarious and irregular Christmas gifts, it now appeared that there was some difficulty in inducing them to do so. That was felt as a grievance, and he wished an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that the practice would be renewed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03710"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: My hon. friend the Member for Kirkcudbright is anxious to have Sunday labour in the Post Office restricted as much as possible, and he is afraid that there has been a tendency to increase it in recent years. I can only say that the Postmaster General and the heads of the Post Office are as anxious to keep Sunday labour down as my hon. friend can be. At the same time, it must be obvious that in a busy establishment like the Post Office a certain amount of urgent work must be done on Sunday, if the public are not to be greatly inconvenienced, and if the Post Office is to carry on the duty for which it exists. My hon. friend cited comparative figures showing the numbers employed in years something like thirty years apart. The number in the later period was very much greater than in the earlier, but, of course, he must remember that the employees of the Post Office, and the new branches of work the Post Office has undertaken, have both increased largely during that time, and, having regard to that, I think he will see that a mere increase in the number actually employed must not lead him to suppose that there has been any desire to increase Sunday work unnecessarily. My hon. friend only referred, to a single instance of additional Sunday labour which has been cast upon the Post Office employees in recent years. That was in the case of the arrangements made by the late Postmaster General, the Duke of Norfolk, to secure the delivery of letters in London on the payment of an express fee of 3d. per mile. As my hon. friend says, that is almost prohibitive, and it is intended to be a prohibitive fee for ordinary purposes. That service was established only to meet cases of emergency, and it was not intended that it should be used except for such cases. I am not sorry, any more than my hon. friend, that it has not been taken advantage of to any large extent. As a matter of fact, the people engaged are two sorters and nine mes-
<image src="S4V0094P0I0804"/>
<col>1365</col>
sengers for a period of about four hours each, so that this has not had a very large effect on the work of the Post Office. My hon. friend inquired whether the men were liable to receive notice to go if they declined to do Sunday duty. The rule in regard to Sunday duty will reduce to a minimum the work that must be done by each man. Formerly there was a sufficient number of volunteers to do the whole of the work, but latterly the number of volunteers for Sunday duty fell off, and there was an insufficient number for the work. Side by side with that, the Postmaster General found springing up a system by which certain of the older men volunteered for Sunday duty regularly every Sunday in the year. He did not think that if they were willing to undertake duty every Sunday in the year that was a thing which should be allowed, and he, of course, felt called upon to make such arrangements as would in the future spread the necessary Sunday duty more widely, and so prevent the men from having an undue amount of Sunday duty to do. That does not apply to men who have entered with a liability to give service on Sunday. Sorters since 1898 have entered on the express condition that they will take Sunday duty if called upon to do so. When men enter the service upon an express condition, which is clearly put before them, I do not think they can have any cause of complaint if they are subsequently called upon to fulfil that condition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03711"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR MARK STEWART</member><membercontribution>: There were some who before 1898 were compelled.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03712"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: It only applies to those who have come in since 1898 subject to the rule. If my hon. friend knows the case of a man who was under no obligation to take Sunday duty when he entered the service, and who was compelled to take duty, I think the Postmaster General should have his attention called to it, with the view to a remedy. I think my hon. friend will see that such alterations as have been made in the allocation of Sunday duty have been made with the view of lessening that duty, and preventing it from falling on one man more than another. I think that is a much more satisfactory
<col>1366</col>
solution than that a few men should he working every Sunday, and I hope my hon. friend will be satisfied with the explanation I have given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03713"><member>MR. THOMAS BAYLEY <memberconstituency>(Derbyshire, Chesterfield)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he wished to call attention to serious grievances which certain classes in the Post Office had at the present time. These grievances were growing from year to year. The hon. Baronet who raised the question of Sunday work gave an account of what had been done by several Committees of the House of Commons which had gone into the grievances of Post Office servants with regard to Sunday work, but unfortunately the late Government and this Government had not acted on the principle which was acted upon in years gone by&#x2014;namely, that steps were taken to redress grievances of servants engaged in the Departments of the State when their existence was satisfactorily shown to the House of Commons. They had the experience of what was called Lord Tweedmouth's Committee. That was a Committee outside this House of Parliament. It was a Committee of highly respectable gentlemen belonging to the other House, and permanent officials were the representatives of the Post Office on that Committee. It was appointed on an absolutely wrong principle. If the Government did not grant a Committee to inquire into the grievances of the men, the dissatisfaction would go on increasing in force. What they had asked for was a Committee of business men of this House to go thoroughly into their grievances, and to report to this House and the Government in what way these could be redressed. This was a constitutional question. This House itself had a right to look into matters affecting the interests of all servants who were paid for out of the rates, whether soldiers, sailors, Post Office officials, or permanent servants of any sort. It was this House's duty to pay them a fair remuneration for their services, and to redress their grievances. This House showed a want of moral courage by throwing that responsibility on the other House or the permanent officials of any Department whatsoever. The position of the lower paid servants
<image src="S4V0094P0I0805"/>
<col>1367</col>
called for attention. If they considered the number of miles the men who delivered letters in the villages had to walk, he thought the Committee would say that the pay they received was very little indeed. These men would be perfectly satisfied if the Government would consider their position in relation to that of workers in the trades of the country&#x2014;railway servants, miners, engineers, and even our own soldiers and sailors, who had received within the last five years considerable increases in their wages. If they took the Returns issued by the Board of Trade they would find that the conditions of those employed in the various trades had been greatly improved. If he remembered right, the increases of wages ran from 5 to 15 per cent. within the last five years. But there had been no increase in the wage of the lower paid Post Office servants corresponding to that, and they had a right to come to this House through their representatives and ask for a Committee of the House to investigate their grievances, and to see whether anything could be done to redress them. The Post Office representative in this House gave him no encouragement when he asked him a question on the subject some time ago. He could assure the hon. Gentleman that the Post Office servants had a number of friends in the country who wanted to treat them fairly and properly. It would be much better if the Government gave this Committee of Inquiry. He thought he could pledge those connected with the Post Office service who had grievances that if, after they had been brought before the Committee, the Committee decided against them, they would loyally abide by that decision.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1368</col>
of the Postmaster General to the subject, but had been told, as politely as possible, that the concession he desired could not be granted because it would not pay. That was no proper answer to give. These inhabitants were entitled to the ordinary rights of British citizens, and that, so far as the Post Office was concerned, was not summed up in a delivery of letters once a week or once a fortnight. They only got the weekly newspaper five or six days after publication, so that their news was frequently a fortnight old&#x0021; They were told that a more frequent delivery would not pay; but these people paid the Imperial taxes, they paid for the public parks in London which they never saw, and all their other taxes, and they were entitled, surely, to get the ordinary rights of British citizens. They did not ask for a delivery every day, but, say, twice a week. It was very bad policy for the Department to say that a more frequent delivery would not pay. He found in looking back to a speech delivered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1897 that he estimated that 16 millions of letters were called for, and he promised to the House that a house-to-house delivery would be given to nearly all the rural districts in the country. Last year's Report showed that nearly 55 million letters were brought into the delivery, and he had no doubt that now 70 or 80 million letters were brought into the delivery. That ought to indicate the neglect which the Post Office authorities had inflicted on the rural districts. If they wanted to make life more tolerable in these remote parts, surely one of the first things they should give them was the civilising influence of the postman.<lb/>
He believed that the Post Office was not so much to blame as the Treasury. There was a letter in <i>The Times</i> recently, written by a man who evidently wrote with inside knowledge, and, with the permission of the Committee, he would quote a few sentences from that letter:&#x2014;
<quote>"The Treasury regard the Post Office as a Department from which they are justified in expecting and demanding a continually increasing net revenue. They consequently look with a most jealous eye upon any proposal by the Postmaster General involving an increase of expenditure, lest it should interfere with the development of this net revenue. And hence it comes about that in Post Office improvements and reforms the Treasury, and not the
<image src="S4V0094P0I0806"/>
<col>1369</col>
Postmaster General, determines whether they shall be carried out or not. The initiative lies with the Post Office, but the Chief of that Department has to do battle with the Secretary of the Treasury on every occasion when an improvement involving an increase of its expenditure, or a reduction of income is proposed. The Secretary to the Treasury is, as a rule, overworked. He is unable to go fully into details. It results that one of the Treasury clerks has to advise him, and the determination rests with this officer, who has no knowledge of the interior working of the Post Office, and no means of gauging the wants of the public, and whose main duty it is to maintain and increase if possible, the Revenue. The Postmaster General may contend that a particular improvement which he proposes is urgently needed, that after a time it will recoup the first outlay or loss by causing an increase of business; but the Treasury official, with the omniscience bred in the atmosphere of that Department, knows better, and, fearful of the immediate loss to the Revenue, advises a refusal. Every Postmaster General in turn has experienced this, and has seen his proposals overruled by the Treasury. Sometimes, when he is fortunate in being on most friendly terms with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he is able to secure a more favourable response to his proposals; but as a rule they are rejected or delayed for years until public opinion, acting through the House of Commons, forces them upon the Government. No one at the Post Office has been able to discover on what precise lines or policy these refusals are made; but it may be assumed that the object is to secure a continually increasing net revenue."</quote>
He would suggest that the Committee should authorise the Postmaster General to give the country these reforms, and he was sure that the country would not grudge but approve of the slight additional expense. The writer of the letter then proceeded to point out that the Post Office revenue had nearly doubled in the last thirty years, having risen from &#x00A3;1,814,000 to &#x00A3;3,576,000, an increase at the rate of &#x00A3;55,000 a year. He would point out that the proportion of profits from Scotland was &#x00A3;375,000 a year, and therefore they were entitled to obtain additional postal facilities in Scotland. The net increase of the Post Office revenue was maintained by a system of starving the recommendations of the Postmaster General and his staff. When the Post Office Estimates were under discussion on the 1st of June, 1899, General Laurie, the Member for Pembroke, had a motion on the Paper to reduce the salary of the Postmaster General by &#x00A3;100. The Member for Caithness urged that there should be a daily delivery in his constituency, and the Member for Montgomery
<col>1370</col>
followed on much the same lines. In reply the present President of the Board of Agriculture, then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, used the following words:&#x2014;
<quote>"The question of a daily delivery was raised by the hon. Member for Caithness. I believe it is a fact that in some parts of Scotland we have not yet been able to carry out a daily delivery; but, of course, we are going steadily forward with the work, and I hope that very soon the whole of the country will be so served. I should say that three-fourths of the whole country have been already accommodated with a daily delivery, and the Department hopes that within a time, measured by months, there will be daily deliveries everywhere."</quote>
That so pleased General Laurie that he withdrew his motion. That speech was delivered two years ago, and he challenged the representative of the Postmaster General now in the House to show that a daily delivery throughout the country was not the policy of the Government when that speech was made, and why that policy had not been carried out since. They were entitled to ask whether that policy had been prevented being carried out by the Treasury. Again he would demand that the Government should give the people in the Highlands and Islands a postal delivery not less frequently than at least twice a week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03715"><member>MR. CATHCART WASON <memberconstituency>(Orkney and Shetland)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that his hon. friend had not stated fully the case specially of the districts where there were stormy seas between the islands and the mainland. There they did not get a weekly delivery, even, and they claimed that they should have at least a delivery of letters twice a week. They were cut off from all possible means of communication, and were frequently quite unable to obtain medical attendance. Life, under such circumstances, was a very serious thing indeed. He hoped the hon. Gentleman in charge of this Vote would not treat this matter lightly. In these remote islands they had some of the finest population in the United Kingdom, and the only means of communication which they had with the mainland was the post office. It was no answer to the demand they made to say that the additional service would not pay. They must regard the Post Office service as a whole, and as a whole the service did pay. He trusted

<p id="S4V0094P0-03716"><member>MR. SCHWANN <memberconstituency>(Manchester, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that nobody seemed to be aware that this Vote was coming on, and therefore he felt that there would not be such a full debate upon it as might have been wished by many Members. He heartily supported the hon. Member who had moved the reduction of the Vote. He knew that there were great grievances unredressed on the part of the Post Office employees. Some of these grievances had been threshed out and remedied to a certain extent, no doubt, between the Duke of Norfolk, who was then Postmaster General, and the present President of the Board of Agriculture. But at the same time there was a rankling feeling as to the decision of the Committee. He thought it was a mistake on the part of the Government that they did not appoint some representative of the employees in the Post Office on that Committee of Inquiry, in order that their case should be heard, and that the sources of their dissatisfaction with their present condition might be traced. It might be said that they would have had only one vote on the Committee, but, at any rate, the employees would have been able to bring their case fully before the other members of the Committee. He did not propose to dwell on the whole range of the grievances of the employees in the Post Office, because certain Members had charge of the different branches; but he wanted to direct the attention of the representative of the Postmaster General in the House of Commons to the case of the non-establishment men in the engineering department of the telegraphs. They claimed that they ought to have the same benefits as were accorded to the unestablished men in other departments of the Post Office. It had been used as an argument against unestablished engineers receiving the stripes, which carried extra allowance, that auxiliaries, who did not work a full day, ought not to have this advantage. But the unestablished engineers did now work the whole day. They were as much daily workers as any other employees in the service. In these other departments
<col>1372</col>
five years service carried an additional 1s. per week pay, but that additional pay was not given to the engineers, although some of them had had thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen years of service, and only 500 out of 3,000 men employed on the engineer service were on the establishment. Then there was the grievance of all classes of postmen and telegraphists as to deferred pay. If a postman or telegraphist died, his widow or children, under certain circumstances, were left without any compensation or any portion of the pension. He thought it was only right that some portion of the deferred pay should be awarded to the children and the widow, as the probability of a man receiving a pension was taken into account in fixing his wages. Lord Welby had pointed out that only 30 per cent. of the postmen reach pension age, and it was only right that something should be done for the widows and children of the remaining 70 per cent. That view had been supported by the late Lord Playfair. Then there was the question of the stagnation of promotion in the telegraph department, which had been agitated for a number of years, and he trusted that the hon. Member the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would give some consideration to it, seeing that there had been such a considerable rise in rents in the large as well as the small towns in England. It would be the desire of the House to have a Committee of the House to go into this question and have a decision with regard to the matter. It had been very desirable to have a Committee to investigate the question of the War Office. That Committee had reported, and as business men they had made practical suggestions to the nation, and a similar result would, no doubt, be the outcome of similar Committees sitting upon and investigating other Departments of State, which would obtain considerable advantage in consequence of their methods being sifted. He would not detain the House further, but if a division was demanded he should certainly support the Amendment, not out of any hostility to the Postmaster General, who, he believed, showed a very conciliatory spirit in this matter, but because it would be a great benefit to lave such a Committee.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03717"><member>MR. JAMES HOPE <memberconstituency>(Sheffield, Brightside)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> desired to say a very few words in answer to the criticisms that had been passed upon the action of the Post Office, which had been accused of want of business initiative. One often heard the same criticism of lack of initiative and business method and enterprise on the part of the Post Office officials, but he had had some knowledge of these men and had worked with them, and he was quite sure from what he had seen that His Majesty and the public could not wish for better public servants. When they were accused of all these faults, he would ask what chance had they of initiating and carrying on their business in a businesslike spirit under the present financial system of the country. They made millions a year for the revenue, but they did not touch a penny of it themselves. They were like the monkey in the story, who was always finding water but was never allowed to drink. The Post Office had not the same freedom as the Army and Navy and other great Departments of State, where any deficiency in any Vote could always be made up out of the excess of another Vote. In the case of the Post Office no such discretion was allowed, and consequently useful measures had to stand still for months in spite of the money which poured into the Post Office on every hand. The Post Office was in an anomalous position; it ought to be one thing or the other; and if it was to be looked upon in the same light as the Customs or the Board of Revenue, then the present system would have to be abolished, and it must be put on the same footing as those Departments, and the system of transfer which was in operation in the Army and Navy Departments extended to it, so that they might have the inducement to economise and have the benefit of their own savings. Let the Postmaster General have something to say as to the disposal of his surplus profits. Let there be a certain minimum revenue, and when once that is paid let the surplus profits be divided between the Treasury and the Post Office, and that which goes to the Post Office be devoted to extending the Post Office strictly on business lines. If the Post Office made &#x00A3;3,500,000, &#x00A3;3,000,000 should go to the Treasury and the
<col>1374</col>
remainder should be equally divided. Under the present financial system it was very unfair that the Post Office officials should be criticised in the manner they were.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03718"><member>MR. BELL <memberconstituency>(Derby)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> wished in a very few words to support the suggestion of the hon. Member for Chesterfield that a Committee should be formed to consider the grievances of the postal employees. It was, he thought, Utopian to hope to find such a large number of workers without a grievance, and some of the grievances might be sentimental, but what he complained of was that there were a variety of grievances which were not looked into. He did not think any advantages would be gained by discussing in detail the grievances of the employees, because this Committee had no power to rectify them, but the Postmaster General would move in the direction of the wishes of these thousands of men by appointing a Committee to inquire into their grievances. By allowing these grievances to accumulate the position became very much like that of a boiler with a man sitting on the safety valve. The grievances would be so bottled up that sooner or later there would be an explosion. It was not desirable that there should be any such difficulty in a public department as a strike, but nothing tended so to work men up into a state of revolt as to allow their grievances to accumulate when they might be attended to at once. If a Committee were appointed to inquire into this matter and report, it would do no harm, and might do a great deal of good, and he hoped the Secretary to the Treasury would give some assurance on behalf of the Postmaster General that this would be done. Complaints had been made from the Front Government Benches as to the accumulation of questions on the Paper, and therefore he thought he would not put down a question which he desired to ask of the hon. Gentleman, but would send it direct to the Postmaster General, and so save the time of the House. Having sent a question to the Postmaster General last week he received the orthodox reply that his letter should receive attention, and he had not received the answer yet. He should repeat the question to-morrow to the Postmaster General, and ask for a

<col>1375</col>
reply, and he would also furnish the Secretary to the Treasury with particulars, that he might inquire into the matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03719"><member>MR. HAY <memberconstituency>(Shoreditch, Hoxton)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he desired to support the motion of the hon. Member for Chesterfield for a Committee of Inquiry, and he did so for the reason that, having been for some years in contact with a considerable number of employees of the Post Office in London, he had found that there was a strong feeling that the departmental Committee did not meet the desire of the employees for a thorough investigation of their grievances. A new inquiry would, he thought, do a great deal to settle the unrest which undoubtedly existed in the minds of many of the employees of the Post Office. He could not but think the employees of the Post Office were justified in asking for an inquiry, having regard to the fact that six years had passed since any investigation was made into their position, and that the conditions of life had changed. He thought their demand for the reconsideration of their terms of pay and promotion was one that should commend itself to the attention of this Committee. Therefore, he hoped hon. Members would not run away with the idea that this Committee should not be appointed because this House was not a proper tribunal, but would grant the demand of these men, which was in his opinion a fair demand, and appoint a Committee to settle once and for all the fact of whether these grievances were just or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03720"><member>SIR WALTER FOSTER</member><membercontribution> also supported the claim for a Committee of Inquiry into the general grievances of the Post Office employees. He had hoped some years ago that the Tweedmouth Committee would have settled these grievances, but he had observed with regret that every year since that Committee was appointed the demand for another Committee had greatly increased. He pressed the Secretary to the Treasury and the Government to seriously consider whether the best way out of the difficulty, and of getting a cheap and effective service all over the country, would not be to have a Committee to investigate the grievances of the Post Office employees. They had heard ex-
<col>1376</col>
pression given to these grievances as to deferred pay and promotion, and the prospect of these men leaving their families unprovided for if they did not live to the pensioned age; and, although he did not suggest that their families should be awarded a pension, at the same time he thought that a compassionate allowance might be given in cases where the wife and family were left helpless by the removal of the breadwinner. Then there were the difficulties in which these men were placed by the increased cost of living and housing, especially in large towns. These questions required consideration, and he believed that a Committee, if appointed, would settle most of those matters. The House was bound, when this agitation had been going on for the last five years, to meet it by a Committee of Investigation, and inquire as to whether the grievances were real or otherwise. There could be no harm in meeting these questions with an impartial Committee, and upon that ground he urged upon the hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury the advisability of conferring with the Postmaster General on the subject. The Post Office was a great source of revenue to the country, and when a Service of the country gave a profit of millions a year to the Treasury it was disappointing and ominous of bad management that, after all the changes that had been made in the postal arrangements in London, in many respects Londoners were worse off than before. The means of communication were worse than they were five years ago; evening mails were collected earlier than they used to be, and there were not the means of communicating with the country that thorp were before the new arrangements were entered into. This was an immense retrogression which was discreditable to a great State Department. He also thought there ought to be increased facilities for answering letters at every post office. On the Continent facilities were given which were never accorded in England. The way to do business was to facilitate transactions with customers. He also wished to say that, in his opinion, many post offices in the country were not only badly equipped, but were ill suited to the work that went through them.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03721"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said it would undoubtedly be for the benefit of the Post Office to facilitate the public service, but the Post Office must have some regard to the value of the object to be obtained by improvements and to the cost that would be incurred in carrying them out. Many persons thought that the Post Office should not be a revenue-producing department at all, but that was not his opinion. He hoped it would always be a revenue-producing department. He had considerable sympathy with the contention of the hon. Member for the Brightside Division of Sheffield, that out of the great increase of profits of the Post Office something should be expended in giving increased facilities to the public. On this occasion they were dealing with an expenditure which, on the postal and telegraph services combined, showed a greater increase than did the corresponding income. Improvements such as those that had been asked for could only be carried out gradually. He thought the object of the hon. Member for Chesterfield was to urge the Government to consent to a Committee of Inquiry to examine into the alleged grievances of the staff; and he said that if an impartial Committee was appointed all the supposed grievances of the men would be explained, that they would feel that they had had a fair hearing, that they would be satisfied with such a tribunal, and that no more would be heard of the questions raised year after year in the House when the Post Office Vote was down for discussion. That was a flattering picture of which everyone would approve, and no one more than those responsible for the Post Office. But what was the real fact? It was only six years ago since a Committee was appointed to consider all these matters. The Committee, which was of a most impartial character, took evidence with the greatest care and fidelity, and until the Report was given no fault was found with the composition of the Committee, and the employees certainly showed no reluctance to come before that Committee. The Committee reported in favour of a great many changes, and every recommendation that that Committee made the Government accepted and
<col>1378</col>
carried out. Not only so, but when the Duke of Norfolk was Postmaster General some matters which had been overlooked, and had not been dealt with by the Tweedmouth Committee, were again inquired into. A Departmental Committee sat upstairs for three weeks, at which any member of the House might have been present, and could, if he had so wished, put questions to the witnesses examined. The result of that Committee was that still further concessions were made; the result to the public was an increased cost in the postal department of a half a million a year, and a corresponding benefit to the employees of the Post Office. What hope was there, therefore, if those Committees were not satisfactory, of another Committee following so soon in their footsteps being more successful than they? On behalf of the Postmaster General, he most strongly deprecated any reopening of inquiries, so recently undertaken, which had resulted in large changes in favour of the staff; but of any kind of inquiry which might be made he thought that which was suggested by the hon. Member for Chesterfield was the worst. He could imagine nobody less fit to examine the details of a great business like the Post Office and examine into the character of every man employed by that complex institution, and fix a fair pay, than a Committee of the House of Commons. He ventured to say that the object of the appointment of a Committee would only be to relieve Members of Parliament from the agitation to which they were now exposed. Nothing new had been adduced which was not before the previous Committee, which was most efficient and impartial. The Report of the Committee had been supplemented by further concessions given by the Committee presided over by the Duke of Norfolk; and what was now asked for was not an inquiry into new conditions of service or new grievances, but an attempt to go into all the demands which were recognised on the last occasion, and an endeavour to find a court of appeal to upset the judgment of the former Committee. There must be some finality about these matters, and he submitted that no case had been made out for any inquiry; and he believed that even if there were to be an inquiry, a

He had said the Tweedmouth Committee settled the matter; that was true. There would have been no grievances with the officials if the recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee had been carried out. Where was the &#x00A3;190 limit given by the Committee? Why was not that given and retained? Why was it reduced to &#x00A3;160? To come to the House under such circumstances and say that a limit had been reached was wrong. Why did the Government so dread the appointment of a Committee to investigate the grievances of these men, who work such long hours and go such long rounds, and whom the Government could not pay well, although they made a profit of &#x00A3;4,000,000 a year? The hon. Member the Secretary to the Treasury did not as an individual believe it was the right thing to do, and why should he officially say that these grievances should not be redressed? We all want our grievances redressed in this world, and he was astonished that the hon. Gentleman, coming as he did from
<col>1380</col>
such a business place as Birmingham, should not have granted the inquiry. He was in entire accord with the hon. Member for the Chesterfield Division, and was in favour of the appointment of this Committee, the opposition to which was an acknowledgment that something was wrong, and that therefore the Government did not want to grant it. He was for justice for all public servants, even to the extent of the hon.

If it were found that these men had no grievances, no harm would be done, while if there really were grievances this inquiry would define them. The attitude taken by the hon.

Such a remark was a slur upon the business capacity of the members of that House. He could not imagine for a moment that the hon.

but even supposing the hon. Gentleman was right in that statement, why could he not say he would grant some sort of inquiry, why not make some concession?

<p id="S4V0094P0-03731"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. DAVID MORGAN <memberconstituency>(Essex, Walthamstow)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> joined in the appeal of the Member for Chesterfield for this inquiry. Not only in the neighbourhood of London but in the rural districts of Essex there was a strong feeling that an inquiry should be held, and if the Committee would not listen to these proposals to have an inquiry now by a Committee of this House there would be continual dissatisfaction on the part of the Post Office employees. Everybody knew that where there was dissatisfaction in a great business establishment the only way to deal with it was to enquire into the cause and adjust it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03732"><member>MAJOR KENNETH BALFOUR <memberconstituency>(Christchurch)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> also joined in the appeal for an inquiry. There was, no doubt, in the country a great body of opinion that there were real grievances and that they should be looked into. In the district he represented it took eighteen months to get a thorough revision of the staff carried out, and the result was that in the year 1898&#x2013;9 the staff was over-worked to the extent of 500 hours in the year. They worked 500 hours overtime. It therefore appeared to him that if there were these grievances or supposed grievances it could not be wrong to look into them from a point of view which would be acceptable to the men. If those grievances did not exist it would be explained to the men that they had no case, and if they did exist they could be remedied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03733"><member>THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR, <memberconstituency>Manchester, E.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: I have listened with great interest
<col>1382</col>
to this debate, and, I confess frankly, with considerable anxiety as to the future of the public service if pressure of the kind which has been put on the Government to-night is persisted in by this House. This House is omnipotent. It can make and unmake Governments. It can decide what, when, and how public money is to be spent. But with that omnipotence I would venture to urge upon Members their great responsibility in dealing with a subject like this. Everyone knows that a great organised body like the Post Office has it in its power to put great pressure upon Members, but I earnestly urge upon hon. Gentlemen that unless we take our courage in both hands, and say that, although most desirous that all legitimate grievances shall be dealt with, we cannot permit the Government as a great employer of labour to have this kind of pressure put upon it, I think the future of the public service is in peril. I assure the Committee that I speak with a great sense of responsibility. In this very case the Post Office employees have brought forward their grievances year after year. Two Commissions have been appointed, and no one ever ventured to impugn the ability or impartiality of the members of those Commissions. Those Commissions made the fullest examination into the case put before them, and reported at length, and as a consequence of that Report the British taxpayers are now paying half a million of money more than they did before, So that the Commissions have been productive of great pecuniary advantage to the Post Office employees. In none of the speeches has any specific complaint been brought forward, or any point urged which suggests the necessity for further enquiry, but only the statement that there is a feeling of uneasiness, and a desire for further examination, and that when such a desire is expressed the House should listen to it. We cannot keep the Civil Service in a sound and healthy condition if we are going to examine into it by a Committee every five years. If the House of Commons were to yield to the very natural temptation of granting a Committee such as has been asked for, though we might escape an inconvenient division we should be unworthy in my opinion of bearing any longer the great responsibility of being

<col>1383</col>
the enormous employer of labour that we are. We should not be carrying out our duty to the public, and, worst of all, we should aim a blow at the Civil Service, which is the boast of this country and the envy of the civilised world, because we should become the parliamentary creatures of every organised body of public servants who chose to use the great power which the Constitution gives them for ends which I am sure they believe to be right, but which this House could not yield to in the manner now suggested without derogating from the high functions and spirit of pure impartiality which this House must maintain if Members are to do their duty by their constituents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03734"><member>MR. JOHN BURNS <memberconstituency>(Battersea)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the Leader of the House, not for the first time, had told them that, if public-servants pressed for redress of their grievances, such pressure would be inconvenient and fraught with danger to the public service. But was not that a reason for the House of Commons to consider whether the present method of dealing with grievances was the right one? He ventured to suggest a better course. Whenever a body of public servants thought they had a grievance, what happened? They created a public opinion, and set afoot an agitation and a demand for a Royal Commission, and frequently, in a moment of panic, the Royal Commission was granted, not for the purpose of those who needed it most, but of those who were best organised. Another method was to ask for an investigation by a Committee, like the Tweed mouth Committee, consisting of a Member of the House of Lords and two permanent officials, who reported to the House of Commons, which mostly took no notice of their Report. Somehow or another, that Committee did not evoke trust and confidence from the men whose grievances it sat to consider. But that evening there had been, not a Royal Commission, not a Tweedmouth Committee, but the whole House of Commons, hour after hour, speaking of and listening to the grievances of postmen, telegraphists, and other employees. Of all tribunals to go into the grievances of Government servants, whether postal, naval, or military, the House of Commons as consti-
<col>1384</col>
tuted was not the best, and he desired to suggest a fourth tribunal, which he believed the Government would be driven to adopt. He suggested that for every spending Department such as the Post Office, there should be sitting regularly or periodically a strong but small Committee of the House of Commons, composed of men from both sides, who would not yield to unfair pressure from postal employees, who would not be susceptible to State servants' clamour, and who could be trusted to do their duty to the State; and that this Committee should have sitting regularly with them the Postmaster General or two or three expert officials to help them, and they to help the head of the Department. In the event of that Committee thinking the demands of the postal employees unreasonable, fictitious, or not what their organisation made them out to be, it would be their duty to sit very severely upon them. Until every public Department had such a Committee as that, political pressure would always be brought to bear upon weak-kneed Members of Parliament. Until the House of Commons appointed such a Committee, money would be wasted and money would be granted to the wrong people, as was invariably the case when money was given as the result of a Government servants' agitation. Could this work? The Secretary to the Treasury had, in his opinion, showed, he would not say a contempt, but a disrespect for the House of Commons which he did not expect a democrat of his status and standing would display. He had said that of all possible tribunals there was none less fit than a Committee of the House of Commons. He (the speaker) differed, and would give the hon. Gentleman a precedent. When the War Office&#x2014;notwithstanding all its protestations of efficiency, capacity, and readiness, down to the last button&#x2014;got into a mess over South Africa, what happened? The House of Commons unanimously appointed three or four business men from both sides of the House to reorganise the business of the War Office.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03736"><member>MR. JOHN BURNS</member><membercontribution>: Oh, but it did. Of course the hon. Gentleman would not
<image src="S4V0094P0I0814"/>
<col>1385</col>
accept literally that view, but four or five men from both sides of the House, noted for probity, industry, and capacity in their private concerns, were elected as a Committee to do what? To draw up the conditions under which the War Office should manage the Army on businesslike lines. He wanted to see a similar Committee sitting in permanence for many of these grievances in connection with the Post Office. Private Bill Committees upstairs, as a rule, were drawn from the best Members of the House, and if such Committees could sit for weeks&#x2014;in some cases for months&#x2014;on large water, gas, or telephone Bills, or on subjects relating to business and private enterprise of every description, involving the employment of millions of money and of scores of thousands of men, there was no reason why there should not be a permanent Standing Committee of Members of the House of Commons attached to each of the large spending departments. If that were done, much fictitious agitation and improper pressure which was now resorted to would disappear. Why did he say that? When a large employer of labour had a grievance with his men he did not always take the advice of his foreman or his superintendent. No. Very frequently, when the manager or superintendent had gone too far, the employer intervened with the personal element, and, if he was a wise employer, corrected the superintendent on the one side or the men on the other. He desired the House of Commons to set up a Standing Committee of capable and firm men, who would crumple up any bogus agitation on the part of competent organisers, who would be the eyes of the House of Commons, and, in a rough way, the conscience of the House of Commons with regard to fair treatment for the men. Until such a permanent Committee was appointed, endowed by the House with power to put a stop to improper pressure, there would always be these annual demands for Royal Commissions and Committees of Inquiry, and, with all respect to postal and other grievances, the time of the House of Commons would be relatively wasted when the work could be so much better done by a small Committee upstairs&#x2014;a Committee which would stand by the permanent officials when they were
<col>1386</col>
right and correct them when they were wrong, as permanent officials sometimes were, as recent experience proved that the hub of the universe did not come up through the doorstep of the War Office or of the Postmaster General. If this were done the head of the department would not enjoy the discredit, as he undoubtedly now did, of being put up as the person who prevented a Committee of Inquiry looking into the grievances. Taking it with all its defects, he believed the British civil service to be the best in the world, and he wanted it to remain the best in the world. Government servants would do a foolish thing, and, from their own selfish point of view, one of the most dangerous things they ever could do, if they unduly occupied the time of the House of Commons with relatively trivial and selfish personal questions, wasting public time which ought to be given to higher political and Imperial questions.<lb/>
He believed that the suggestion he had made was the only way out. Why did he say that? The County Council had 12,000 employees. Next to the Government it was one of the largest employers of labour in London. What did they do? What did Glasgow and Liverpool do? Their employees occasionally organised for the redress of grievances. Did the County Council accept the <i>ipsissima rerba</i> of the head of the fire brigade, or the parks department, on the main drainage? No, they put the grievances through the sieve of a small sub-committee, whose conclusions were revised by the main committee. The decision was then sent to the council to adopt or reject. What was good enough for our municipal life was good enough for the House of Commons. He believed that if a Committee were appointed the question would be permanently solved. What would happen? When this Committee presented its annual Report at the end of the Postmaster General's annual document, Members of the House of Commons would say, "Hallo&#x0021; A Committee have gone into this; they have given the men a fair show; they have discussed the grievances with the permanent officials and the men; we will vote for the Committee." In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the House of Commons as a body would stand by the Report and recommendations of the
<image src="S4V0094P0I0815"/>
<col>1387</col>
Committee. The result would be that men who really had grievances to be redressed would have them redressed, while the men who applied pressure improperly would get the punishment which every servant, whether private or public, had a right to receive for misstatements, or selfish or improper action. If some such scheme was not adopted the area of Government enterprise would be checked, permanent officials would be considerably inconvenienced, the tone of the service would be embittered and discredited. It was because he wanted the civil service to be as good as it at present was that he put forward this suggestion as an alternative to the negative proposal of the Secretary to the Treasury.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03737"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. STUART WORTLEY <memberconstituency>(Sheffield, Hallam)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the speech just delivered by the hon. Member for Battersea was, in his opinion, a very courageous one. He did not, however, think that the hon. Member intended his speech to be what it actually was in substance, namely, a speech supporting the Government on the present issue before the House. The hon. Member manifested a great desire that a tribunal should be created which would dispose permanently of the question now before the Committee. He would point out that all the tribunals indicated by the hon. Member for Battersea were practically different from the proposal to appoint a Select Committee which was before them. The hon. Member for Battersea seemed to have got hold of the true idea, which was that there should be some tribunal to which grievances of this kind might be referred, and that tribunal should have in it an element of permanence and generality of view by not being confined, as the proposed Select Committee would be to the interest of one particular Department. The only thing which the hon. Member for Battersea apparently forgot was that it was necessary, whatever tribunal they adopted, that it should have complete independence, and be entirely free from the influence of what was called the vote-catching element. He hoped that hon. Members of this House would have the courage to say that they would not allow themselves to be open to influences of that kind.
<col>1388</col>
The great unorganised majority of the people were interested in this matter, and they deserved to have the protection of hon. Members of this House. The hon. Member for Battersea pointed to the Private Bills Committees in this House, and paid them a tribute which they deserved, for being a tribunal whose competence and impartiality everybody was completely satisfied with. But the hon. Member evidently forgot that no Member of the House was allowed to serve on that Committee during the consideration of a Bill in which his own constituency was concerned. They could not protect the members of the Committee which had been suggested by the mover of this reduction from being influenced by their own constituencies.<lb/>
He thought the Secretary to the Treasury had taken a broad and statesmanlike view of this question, and he agreed with him that a Committee of this House was not the best tribunal to deal with a matter of this kind. Perhaps it was true that, after all, the best tribunal to deal with a question of this kind was not a Committee consisting of gentlemen who valued, as every right-minded man did value, the privilege of sitting in this House. By the inevitable conditions of the case hon. Members did sit in this House largely by the votes of public servants. He thought there was set up some considerable time ago some sort of permanent Civil Service Committee for the purpose of adjudicating upon the claims of public servants. He did not know whether that Committee was in existence still, and he did not know whether it existed for a long or a short time. He thought it must have had in it that infirmity which marked the Tweedmouth Committee, which was a sort of domestic arrangement, and which consisted chiefly of members of the public service, and consequently did not command the necessary amount of confidence. That was the defect, if there was one, in the Tweedmouth Committee. Therefore he thought that any Committee appointed in the future ought not to be constituted in the way the Tweedmouth Committee was constituted. Any tribunal which was appointed in the future would have to be free from these influences if they wanted to secure absolute impartiality
<image src="S4V0094P0I0816"/>
<col>1389</col>
and independence. It was a bad thing to have upon such a tribunal men who have been under electioneering pressure, and on the other hand it did not command public confidence to have persons on the tribunal whose official conduct was practically being arraigned. He wished that some kind of permanent tribunal could be invented, but he did not think that the hon. Member for Battersea had succeeded in placing before them the exact model. What he should like to see established was not the tribunal which had been proposed that evening. He trusted, therefore, as his right hon. friend the Leader of the House had said, that hon. Members of this House would take their courage in both hands and declare that this was a motion which would excite the hope among employees that something might be wrung from the Government by pressure upon Members of Parliament. Such pressure ought not to be exerted, and if the House of Commons gave way to that pressure to that extent hon. Members would be proceeding in the direction indicated by the Leader of the House.<lb/>
For these reasons he hoped this motion would be negatived by a large majority of the Members of this House, and he believed it might be safely negatived without doing any injustice to this very large body of public servants. He was sure the Government would be disposed to consider whether they should not take time to see if some kind of tribunal could not be devised which would not have the infirmities attached to Departmental Committees on which sat representatives of the public department itself whose organisation was under discussion. On the other hand they should have on such a tribunal, besides the independence which he had already indicated, that permanence and general breadth of view which alone could be got by some body such as he had indicated. He did not know whether, under these circumstances, this motion would be defeated. He confessed that, if the motion was successful, he thought that all the evils indicated by the Leader of the House would be in great danger of being realised. He had sat in this House for many years, and he had seen motions dealing with the grievances of Post Office servants rejected over and over again by this House. In this particular case
<col>1390</col>
they had not long ago the appointment of the Tweedmouth Committee, which gave an extraordinary amount of time and trouble to the discussion of this question. That Committee was undoubtedly composed of men against whom not a word could be said. Even though they might complain in respect of that Committee that its procedure was rigid and its composition unsatisfactory, or that one or two of its members, being public servants, might have had preconceived ideas on the matters at issue, they could not deny that they had since had what was practically a second Committee in the inquiry held by the present President of the Board of Agriculture. It was difficult to conceive of an inquiry carried on under more sympathetic and elastic conditions than the inquiry which was held by the right hon. Gentleman the President of the Board of Agriculture in conjunction with the Duke of Norfolk. The right hon. Gentleman was a man who was always ready to listen to all kinds of public complaints, and he dealt with them in a manner which gave satisfaction to his fellow-subjects. He hoped, therefore, that the present motion would not be pressed, because he thought there was a general desire amongst hon. Members that some better tribunal should be devised for the permanent solution of these constantly occurring questions. He hoped that this motion for the appointment of a Select Committee would be negatived by a large majority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03738"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. WEIR</member><membercontribution> said that a few years ago they were promised further postal facilities in the rural districts, more especially in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The predecessor of the present Postmaster General did splendid work in this direction, and he regretted that he was not in office at the present moment. Recently things had been going back in this respect, and in many rural districts at the present time the postal facilities in some parts were extremely unsatisfactory. More frequent deliveries were much needed. When considering this question the Postmaster General seemed to decide solely upon the amount of correspondence, but that was not the principle upon which a great business ought to be conducted. Singer's Sewing Machine Company had
<image src="S4V0094P0I0817"/>
<col>1391</col>
branches all over the world, and although some of those branches did not pay, they were kept going by the branches which did pay. He did not understand why the Post Office did not conduct their system upon sound business lines. When the Post Office had an enormous surplus of between &#x00A3;3,000,000 and &#x00A3;4,000,000, some part of it ought to be used in providing better postal facilities in the poorer districts. Instead of progressing they were standing still. He suggested that in certain districts the Post Office should follow the example of many business firms by using cycle carts. He would be glad to be relieved from the duty of constantly asking questions in regard to the postal service He hoped something would be done to improve the service in the Highlands. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Preston had done much to improve the postal service throughout the country, and with his experience and grasp would have made an admirable Postmaster General. He thought more money-order offices might be provided in the Western Highlands for the use of the fishing population. Many of these people went to the east coast fishing, and when they wanted to remit money to their families they found there was a lack of money-order offices. If it were not possible to issue and pay postal orders at every rural post office arrangements might be made for these offices to conduct money order and savings bank business one or two days a week. A great department like the Post Office should not pursue the niggardly system of starving the poorer districts. The Post Office should treat them more liberally than hitherto. He asked what progress was being made with regard to the telephone system which was to be carried on by the Post Office, and also called attention to the fact that owing mainly to the loss of postal orders by the public the department gained some &#x00A3;15,000 a year. He suggested that postal orders should be issued with a counterfoil which would enable the sender to recover the value of the order in the event of its being lost.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03739"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member has referred to the postal facilities given to the people of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. He
<col>1392</col>
represented to the House that there was some difference of opinion between the Post Office and the Treasury on this matter. He seems to be of opinion that the Post Office would be only too glad to make large extensions, but that some subordinate official of the Treasury, over whom neither my right hon. friend nor myself can exercise control, prevents the carrying out of the good intentions of the Postmaster General. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no such difference of opinion on these matters, and I may go further and assure him that both the Post Office and the Treasury are anxious to extend as far as circumstances permit postal facilities in the remote districts. The hon. Member has referred to the progress that was made when my right hon. friend the President of the Board of Agriculture was Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the Duke of Norfolk was Postmaster General. He does an injustice to the present occupants of those offices in going back to what was then done. A great step in advance was made then, but it should not be made a matter of complaint that we are not progressing at the same rate now. The Post Office could not afford to progress at the same rate. We hope to make progress by degrees, and to provide better facilities than exist at the present time. The hon. Member for Inverness and my hon. friend the Member for Orkney urged that the Post Office should not consider too closely whether certain services would pay or not, but should consider the service as a whole and the profit obtained there from, being content to work some of the services at a loss. I do not dispute that statement for a moment. That is the principle on which the Post Office works, but if we were to comply with every demand for increased facilities made upon us, the profit of the whole would disappear shortly, and we should have a loss instead. What is clear, and what I have indicated earlier in the evening, is that the policy of the Treasury and the Post Office for some time has been that the gross profit from the postal service should be divided between a contribution to the revenue of the country and the further improvement of the postal service. That is so already. Take the case of the mails
<image src="S4V0094P0I0818"/>
<col>1393</col>
to Stornoway, which the hon. Member has frequently brought before the House. Does he imagine that service pays? Not a bit of it. The loss is between three and four times as great as the revenue derived from it. One reason for having this business conducted by the Government is that the cost may be more evenly spread, and that postal service may not be impossible in the scattered populations; but there must be some limit to that, and some regard must be had to the amount of business in particular localities.<lb/>
There was one other question raised by the hon. Gentleman, and that was as regards the amount of money appearing in the Vote on account of money orders or Post Office orders which were lost, or from some cause not presented for payment. Some of them may be lost, some of them may be accumulating in the hands of the receivers, or some of them may be mislaid by receivers. A considerable part of the sum is due to the discount under which these orders are paid when they run for more than a certain period. The hon. Member is aware that if they are not cashed within a certain limit of time they are, after that time has expired, subject to discount. One suggestion the hon. Member made was that, for the purpose of identification, in the case of postal orders lost, there should be issued a counterfoil which could be kept by the senders. That is a point well worthy of consideration. My attention has not been drawn to it before, but I will confer with the Postmaster General about it and see whether anything can be done. A question was asked as to the Government system of telephones within the metropolitan area. I am afraid I have nothing more definite to add to what I said some weeks ago, when I stated that I expected that a considerable part of the system would be open before the close of the present year. Of course, it is in the interest of the Post Office and the Treasury, having embarked considerable capital on this, that we should open the service to the public, and endeavour to secure a revenue from it, at the earliest possible moment, and our efforts will be directed towards that object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03740"><member>MR. FLYNN <memberconstituency>(Cork, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he wanted to bring forward a case in which the Post-
<col>1394</col>
master General had conducted the business most deplorably. Cork post office was a place where business had been growing enormously and the profits had been very large. Well, would it be believed that on account of a comparatively trifling sum of money the Post Office declined to accede to the representations made by the chamber of commerce and the people of that city with respect to the plans for the new buildings? The Postmaster General and his representatives in Ireland considered themselves better judges of what was required than the chamber of commerce and the people of Cork. It had been pointed out to the Postmaster General time and again that the buildings which were being erected would be totally inadequate to meet the accommodation required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03741"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The question of post office buildings does not arise on this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03742"><member>MR. FLYNN</member><membercontribution> said he would not pursue the subject further, for he presumed that at a later period he would have an opportunity of bringing it before the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03743"><member>MR. MOON <memberconstituency>(St. Pancras, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the right hon. Member for the Hallam Division opposed the request that a Committee of this House should be appointed to inquire into grievances, on the ground that Members would be liable to pressure. There was no doubt that some Members of the House would be liable to pressure, but there was a large number of Members who would not. There were Members for rural districts and the Members for the Universities who would be peculiarly suitable to inquire into the grievances of the men. If such a Committee were appointed it would satisfy the wish of the employees. Men of judgment were wanted, and if the members of the Committee were drawn from the classes he mentioned there would be no risk of pressure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03744"><member>MR. NANNETTI <memberconstituency>(Dublin, College Green)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> supported the proposal that an inquiry should be made into the grievances of the Post Office employees. He was surprised that the right hon. Member for the Hallam Division objected to the appointment of a Committee. The claims made on behalf of these men did not
<image src="S4V0094P0I0819"/>
<col>1395</col>
come from any particular section of the House. He remembered attending several meetings of the men where this claim for an inquiry was brought forward, and letters were read from Conservatives and Unionists, Nationalists and Liberals. He was surprised to find that the promises made to the postal officials by these Members were not being followed up in the House now. What was wanted was a Committee that the employees would have confidence in&#x2014;a Committee who would look seriously into the grievances of the men. He might state, with reference to his own constituency, that he was largely returned by the votes of the postal officials. Since he came into this House he had brought before the hon. Gentlemen opposite several grievances of those officials, but he was sorry to say that his efforts on their behalf had had very little effect. He had received many promises, but there had been no performance. He thought it was high time that an inquiry was held into the claims put forward, not from Ireland alone, but from England, Scotland, and Wales. One matter the men in Dublin had to complain about was a system called the three-shift system. It meant that the men were on duty from four in the morning till eight at night. Although they were not continuously at work during the whole of that time, they were at the service of the Government, and liable to be called upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03745"><member>MR. BANBURY <memberconstituency>(Camberwell, Peckham)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> remarked that the idea that the Post Office made a large profit, and that they might do something in cheapening the cost of letter postage, was a delusion, because if they did that they would have to increase the taxation of the State. Of course, what they took off with one hand they took away with another. This discussion had been rather vague, and he should like to allude to one little grievance which he had himself, and that was in regard to the horses employed in the mail carts in His Majesty's Service. He had inspected these horses, and had come to the conclusion that they were certainly, some of them at any rate, very far from being in a satisfactory state. Many of them were in a very poor condition, and doing very hard work. He thought it was not creditable to the State that these horses were not in as good condition as those employed by the
<col>1396</col>
London County Council, the Tramways Companies, or the Road Car Company, than which no horses could be kept in better condition.<lb/>
Having ventilated this grievance, he wished to say a few words as to the real question before the Committee, namely, the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the alleged grievances of postmen. When he was first elected in 1892 this question was brought under his notice, and he was asked whether he would support an inquiry into the grievances of the Post Office employees at that time. He was new to Parliamentary life, and it was pointed out to him that, if the inquiry could do no good, it, at any rate, could do no harm; and that it would show that if the grievances existed something might be done to remedy them. He said that he would vote for an inquiry, and when he was returned the question came before the House, and he announced that he would vote in favour of the inquiry. That inquiry was held by a Committee, of which Lord Tweed mouth was chairman. An hon. Gentleman opposite said the inquiry should be held by people in whom the men had confidence; but in whom could they have more confidence than Lord Tweed mouth, who could not be said to be in favour of the capitalists who were sometimes held up to such opprobrium? What was the result of the inquiry of that Committee? The wages of the Post Office officials were increased by &#x00A3;400,000. In 1895 another inquiry was asked for, and, as far as he was personally concerned, he refused to join in the demand for it. It was, however, given, and he believed it was a fair and impartial inquiry; although his experience of the world told him that no inquiry would ever satisfy the men. That was only human nature; he was quite certain that whatever was offered to him himself would not appear sufficient for his services. The result of the second inquiry was a still further increase in the salaries of the Post Office employees, but still they were not satisfied, and they demanded a particular inquiry by a Committee of the House of Commons. He had at his last election told his constituents that he should refuse to accede to that request. He had sat on many Select Committees of the House of
<image src="S4V0094P0I0820"/>
<col>1397</col>
Commons, and he could not conceal from himself that there was generally a political bias in these Committees. That was a very serious question for the nation when pressure was brought to bear on the disposition of the money of the taxpayers. During the nine years in which he had had the honour of having a seat in the House of Commons, one of the most serious questions that he had had to consider was the constant pressure which was brought to bear on Members of Parliament by civil servants to give them money which belonged not to them, but to the nation. If that sort of thing went on the time would come when the suffrage would have to be taken from civil servants. Supposing this Committee asked for were appointed, what would be the result? Every other branch of the Civil Service would require a Committee to inquire whether they were receiving the wages they ought to receive, and the result would be a com-</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03754">3. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;571,085, be granted to His Majesty, to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1902, for the Expenses of the Post Office Packet Service."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03755"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. WEIR</member><membercontribution> said that under Item A there was a sum of &#x00A3;3,000 for the packet service to Stornoway. The boat was forty years old, and carried His Majesty's mails through stormy seas at a speed not exceeding, at the best of times, ten knots an hour, and was seventy times late in three months. The experiment was commenced on April 1st, and he wished to know how long it was to continue before the Post Office asked for tenders for another steamer. Would the hon. Gentleman give an assurance that tenders would be invited for a swifter steamer? If the hon. Gentleman's predecessor had been in office he believed a better steamer would have been provided. But unfortunately the Duke of Norfolk was not Postmaster General, and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Preston did not represent the Post Office in the House of Commons. He had stated that the matter would be carefully considered, and if he had continued to represent the Post Office a better service would now be <i>un fait accompli</i>. But of course the hon. Gentleman was yet young at his business, he was not seasoned, and he had not the experience of the right hon. Gentleman who preceded him.<lb/>
He hoped, however, the hon. Gentleman would give him an assurance that the service would be improved, and that it was not the intention of the Post Office to continue to employ the "Clydesdale" for this service. The Island of Lewis had a population of 30,000, and Stornoway was one of the finest naval reserve stations in the kingdom. The Island deserved better consideration from His Majesty's Government. The forty-year-old tub might go down one day, and he hoped the hon. Gentleman would not then be on board, or even the hon. Member for Peckham who spoke of the people in the Highlands as uncivilised. Would the hon. Gentleman follow in the steps of his predecessor, who promised a better
<col>1404</col>
boat? The railway had now been carried up to Mallaig, but what was the use of this if the western seaboard and the islands were not to be developed? He hoped he would not be met with the miserable plea that the Stornoway mail service did not pay. The Post Office made a profit of nearly four millions a year, and surely the Treasury could afford to be more liberal. The Government gave large subsidies to steamers carrying mails to foreign countries and the colonies; they really ought to look after the needs of the people at home. In case he did not get a favourable reply he would safeguard himself by moving the reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03756">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That Item A be reduced by &#x00A3;100, in respect of the Contract for the Conveyance of Mails between Kyle and Stornoway."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Weir.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03757"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said that the subject had been already mentioned in the course of the discussion, but he would repeat briefly the facts of the case. The service no doubt was not a very fast one, and he could easily imagine a much better one. He hoped, however, that in some respects the mails to Stornoway would be accelerated in the course of the summer. He thought that the railway company were contemplating an acceleration of the trains during the tourist season, which would enable the mails to be delivered more rapidly. The hon. Member asked that the Post Office should give up the present contract, and invite tenders for a new service of sixteen, eighteen, or twenty knots&#x2014;the hon. Member placed no limit to his ambition. The hon. Member complained that the present boat was forty years old, but he was told she was still a good, seaworthy vessel. If his memory did not mislead him, the "Victory" was forty years old when Nelson selected her for his flagship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03758"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. WEIR</member><membercontribution>: She was not a steamship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03759"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said he was perfectly well aware of that. What were the facts of the case? The service was already run at a very considerable loss. The subsidy for the packet was &#x00A3;3,000 a year, and the cost of the whole service to Stornoway was
<image src="S4V0094P0I0824"/>
<col>1405</col>
&#x00A3;4,270, and the revenue it brought in was only &#x00A3;1,258. Under those circumstances it could not be said that the Post Office was dealing ungenerously with Stornoway. He himself would only be too glad to call for tenders for a new service if it could be done without further expense to the taxpayers, but he would not be justified in incurring increased expenditure, seeing how largely the present expenditure exceeded the revenue. After all, in such matters they should look to the country as a whole. Other districts had to be considered, and the debate afforded a sufficient indication as to how numerous were the claims on the Post Office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03760"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. WEIR</member><membercontribution> said he was really sorry the hon. Gentleman had not given him a more satisfactory reply. He was sure he would have received much more encouragement from the hon. Gentleman's predecessor.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03766">Original Question again proposed.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03767"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he desired some information on a question which had been brought before the Committee year after year on this Vote, namely, the question of the lascars serving on board P. and O. steamers. He had always thought that the history of the question was one of the most extraordinary ever brought before the House of Commons. Year after year his friend Mr. Havelock Wilson, who was for many years Member for Middlesbrough, had brought forward the question of the defiance of the law by the P. and O. Company, who were subsidised by the House of Commons, and although for one or two sessions the Government attempted to evade the contention that the P. and O. Company did defy the law, yet by admirable perseverance Mr. Wilson at last compelled
<col>1408</col>
the present Home Secretary, who was then President of the Board of Trade, to admit that the P. and O. Company had openly and persistently defied the law, and that, in spite of continued warnings, they still declined to give the lascars in their employment that amount of cubic space accommodation which the law required. The matter had been before the House year after year, and as far as he could recollect, when it was last debated, the Home Secretary stated that it was still under discussion with the P. and O. Company, and the right hon. Gentleman led the Committee to believe that the P. and O. Company would be called upon to obey the law. What he wanted to know was whether the P. and O. Company had yet agreed to provide for their lascar seamen that accommodation which every other company carrying mails and subsidised by
<image src="S4V0094P0I0826"/>
<col>1409</col>
Parliament was compelled, by the law of the land, to give. In a previous debate the chairman of the P. and O. Company took refuge behind some Indian regulations, but it was proved to the satisfaction of the Committee that that did not cover the ease, and that P. and O. boats sailing from England were bound by the regulations of the English Board of Trade. The pretext was put forward on behalf of the P. and O. Company that it was impossible for them to work their ships with white labour, and that it was absolutely essential for them to employ lascars in going through the tropics.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03768"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the hon. Member? There is an action by the Board of Trade against this company now pending, and while it is pending it is impossible for me to discuss the hearing of the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03769"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said it was very satisfactory after all these years to have got so far, but he should like to hear from the President of the Board of Trade when the action was commenced and how soon it would be heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03770"><member>THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE (Mr. GERALD BALFOUR, <memberconstituency>Leeds, Central</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: That entirely depends on the courts.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03771"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said it did not depend on the courts when the action was commenced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03772"><member>MR. GERALD BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: This is an agreed action between the Board of. Trade and the P. and O. Company as to whether the law has been infringed. It was commenced about six months ago, but I cannot determine when it will be heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03773"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he confessed that that explanation was exceedingly unsatisfactory. Let him recall the history of the matter. It was four or five years ago since in his own hearing the then hon. Member for Middlesbrough asserted from his own knowledge&#x2014;and he spoke for the seamen of the country that that great and powerful company were breaking the law. He was contradicted flatly by the representative of
<col>1410</col>
the Board of Trade and challenged to produce cases. He did produce cases&#x2014;specific instances&#x2014;and then after a controversy extending over, he thought, two years, his hon. friend compelled the President of the Board of Trade to admit that the company were breaking the law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03774"><member>MR. GERALD BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: It is doubtful whether this matter is under Indian law or English law, and it is really to decide that that this action has been taken. I cannot explain at the moment the precise form the action takes, but it is an action which has been agreed upon to decide whether the P. and O. Company are under Indian law or English law.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03775"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he must persist in his statement that, so far as they had been able to get information from the Board of Trade, it was entirely unsatisfactory. It was two years since he heard the President of the Board of Trade, state that the law had been broken, and that immediate steps would be taken to enforce it. Now they were told that some agreement of a technical and abstract character had been come to between the Board of Trade and the P. and O. Company to determine whether the law had been broken. Was that the way the Board of Trade proceeded, against persons who had broken the law? Was that the usual procedure? If was not the usual procedure. If it were brought to the knowledge of the Board of Trade that the law had been broken, they did not enter into an agreement with the person breaking the law to have an action such as had been described. The right hon. Gentleman did not even remember the character of the action or when it was likely to be brought to trial. The whole history of the matter was of the most suspicious and extraordinary character. He did not believe that any other body of men less powerful, less influential, and less wealthy than the P. and O. Company could have for such a number of years continued to defy the law. In previous debates the plea was put forward on behalf of the company, in order to justify their conduct in breaking the law, that they were compelled to employ lascars&#x2014;that they were necessary for the work. But
<image src="S4V0094P0I0827"/>
<col>1411</col>
the Orient Company, which went over the same route, employed white labour, and the reason why the P. and O. Company employed black labour was because it was cheaper, because the keep of the lascars did not cost a third of the keep of white men, because they received very small wages, and were crowded into wretched accommodation. That was why the lascars were employed. The P. and O. Company found it to their interest to boycott white labour, They had heard about the necessity of encouraging the mercantile marine and British seamen, who were being almost wiped off the face of the waters, and yet a great company, enjoying a subsidy of &#x00A3;300,000 a year from Parliament, were the greatest enemies of British seamen, by employing an enormous quantity of cheap Asiatic labour. If they insisted in employing Asiatic labour to the exclusion of white labour, which other companies employed over the same seas, they ought to be compelled to apply the same sanitary laws and give the same accommodation. It was monstrous that such a state of things should be tolerated for a single hour. As they were called upon to vote a subsidy to the company, the Committee had a right to put pressure on the Board of Trade to put an end to breaches of the law. In order to give the Committee an opportunity of expressing an opinion on the matter he moved to reduce the Vote by &#x00A3;50,000 in respect of this item.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03776">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That Item E be reduced by &#x00A3;100, in respect of the Contract for the Conveyance of Mails to Asia and Australia."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Dillon.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03777"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. HENNIKER HEATON <memberconstituency>(Canterbury)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that, before referring to the matter raised by the hon. Member, he might be permitted to make one observation as to the extraordinary way the debate had been conducted, by which they were unable to discuss the question of the Postmaster General not being in the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03778"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member must now confine himself to the subject matter of the debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03779"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. HENNIKER HEATON</member><membercontribution> said he had asked permission to make that statement,
<col>1412</col>
and would now proceed to discuss the Vote. His complaint was that the Packet Vote should not be charged to the Post Office at all. Up to 1868 it was charged to the Admiralty, and a very large proportion of it was not for Post Office purposes at all. There was one item which he strongly objected to, and that was the sum of &#x00A3;60,000 for the mail service between Vancouver and Hong Kong. He objected to that sum being placed on the Post Office Vote. The mails from Vancouver to Hong Kong&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03780"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member is anticipating. He is now discussing the next item&#x2014;Item F. He must confine himself to Item E.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03781"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. HENNIKER HEATON</member><membercontribution> said that Item E deserved the consideration of the Committee, because the whole of the subsidies should not be charged to the Post Office. The service to Australia was quite unworthy of the country. A Return issued by the Postmaster General of Victoria showed that the P. and O. boats were always from two to four days later than the French boats carrying mails between England and Australia. Yet it is only fair to say that the P. and O. boats delivered the mails before their contract time. The absence of the Postmaster General from the House of Commons and the utter inability of his hon. friend to explain the Vote were a sufficient condemnation of the way it was brought before the Committee. The whole explanation of the P. and O. service to Australia was that the small subsidy paid to the company for years prevented any other company from competing. While he had the greatest respect for the P. and O. Company, and for the splendid officers and men they employed, apart from black labour, he thought it was a great wrong to the country that the Post Office authorities never called for tenders for carrying mails to Australia until six months before expiration of the contracts, which made it impossible for any other company to compete, because it required years to make preparations in order to tender for such a great service to be performed in quicker time. He felt he was not able to go into the general question of the packet services,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0828"/>
<col>1413</col>
but he should point out as each item came forward the most astounding anomalies, which would not be tolerated for a day if the Post Office was conducted on businesslike lines.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03782"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution> said that, like his hon. friend the Member for East Mayo, he too remembered the late Member for Middlesbrough moving in the matter of the lascars employed by the P. and O. Company. He recollected, if he was not mistaken, that it had been held that ships leaving British ports were bound to carry out the Board of Trade regulations. Perhaps the Attorney General would state if ships leaving British ports and flying the British flag, whether they carried British or foreign or coloured seamen, were not bound to conform to the Board of Trade regulations? The question was raised whether the lascars, being shipped at Bombay, should only receive the accommodation laid down for Eastern seamen, but the late hon. Member for Middlesbrough proved beyond doubt that, whether the lascars were shipped at Bombay or any other port in the East, so far as outward voyages from England were concerned, the regulations of the Board of Trade were broken. Now, after two years, the Committee was told that some friendly action was pending between the Board of Trade and the P. and O. Company to try and establish some <i>modus vivendi</i> by which the company might bring themselves within the four corners of the law. The President of the Board of Trade dissented. What, then, was the object of this lawsuit? He asked whether or not all sailors, whether coloured or European, sailing under the British flag from British ports, were entitled to the same amount of cubic space for sleeping and eating purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03783"><member>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir ROBERT FINLAY, <memberconstituency>Inverness Burghs</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: The proceedings which have been referred to are for the purpose of having it determined whether or not the Board of Trade regulations apply in the case of the P. and O. Company in regard to the employment of lascars. The P. and O. Company have contended they are subject to Indian Acts, which are different in effect, and that the regulations with regard to British seamen
<col>1414</col>
do not apply. These proceedings are not friendly proceedings with a view to a compromise of any sort or kind; they are proceedings in which both parties are actuated by a strong desire to have the point settled once for all as to what the law on the subject is. As regards the date at which the proceedings will come to hearing, I think it is fixed for the 18th of this month&#x2014;at all events, it is some early date. The proceedings are these:&#x2014;The P. and O. Company have brought a Petition of Right on the ground that the disallowance of space with reference to the employment of lascars on their boats is illegal. A question of law may arise with regard to the form of the proceedings, but it is hoped that the law as to the provision of space for lascars will be determined.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03784"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution> complained that more than four years had elapsed since this matter was brought before the House, but the Government were still allowing British seamen to be squeezed out of British subsidised ships by lascars. It would be said that lascars were British subjects, but they were not men upon whom the country could depend to fight its ships in case of war. The great difficulty at the present moment was to get men for the Navy. Something like 30,000 men were required for mobilisation, and whereas the Government on the 4th March last established a system of Royal Naval Reserves in order that they might have a reserve of British seamen to man their ships, they had only been able to get 800 men up to the present in all the ports of the United Kingdom. The Navy was being starved because the merchant service was starved. The conduct of the Government upon this subject had not been at all straightforward for a patriotic Government. They were subsidising this company and enabling it to make money as against other patriotic shipowners who employed British labour, and as a protest he should certainly support the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03785"><member>MR. J. WILSON <memberconstituency>(Glasgow, St. Rollox)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> thought the hon. Member had got a good deal out of his depth. He was not at all correct in stating that the P. and O. Company was the only company which employed lascars.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1415</col>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03786"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution>: I did not make any such statement.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03787"><member>MR. J. WILSON</member><membercontribution> pointed out that nearly all the companies employed lascars as firemen, and it was a good thing they did, as lascars were much better fitted for that work than Europeans.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03788"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution> said that the P. and O. Company did not by any means confine their employment of lascars to the work of firemen.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03789"><member>MR. COURTENAY WARNER <memberconstituency>(Staffordshire, Lichfield)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that whether or not the P. and O. Company employed lascars was not the point under discussion. The question before the Committee was whether this company was to receive this subsidy if it did not comply with the Board of Trade regulations. It did not matter in the least whether the company were entitled legally to run ships to India and back with or without this accommodation. It was all very well to say there was an action pending. The point was not what the law could compel the company to do, but what the House could compel them to do by this subsidy, and his contention was that the subsidy should not be given to a company which did not provide proper accommodation for the, crew, By giving this subsidy for carrying the mails the Government were really subsidising the English merchant navy, and in return for such a large subsidy there should be a proper carrying out of the Board of Trade regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03790"><member>MR. T. P. O'CONNOR <memberconstituency>(Liverpool, Scotland)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> had a distinct recollection that on the last occasion when this matter was discussed the present Home Secretary emphatically declared that in his opinion the P. and O. Company were violating the law, and that if they continued to do so it would be the duty of the Board of Trade to take notice of the matter. All that his valorous words had come to, however, was that there was to be a more or less friendly action between the Government and the P. and O. Company&#x2014;an action too, started by the company. What the Committee had expected was that the Board of Trade would take action.</membercontribution></p>
<col>1416</col>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03791"><member>MR. GERALD BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: It is true the action is started by the P. and O. Company, but it is in consequence of the action taken by the Board of Trade. The Board of Trade has disallowed the cubic space, and the P. and O. Company have brought an action called a "Petition of Right" against that disallowance, and upon that Petition of Right will be decided whether the company are entitled to engage their lascars upon the Indian regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03792"><member>MR. T. P. O'CONNOR</member><membercontribution> admitted that that was a satisfactory answer to that particular point. But even supposing it was decided that the company were entitled under Indian law to give the lascars less cubic space than they would have to give to English sailors under the English law, that did not really affect the attitude this Committee ought to adopt, This was a Vote of &#x00A3;300,000 of British money to this particular company. Had not the Committee a right to ask that the company which received this large sum of money should give proper protection to the health and life not only of the lascars, but also of the rest of the crew and the passengers on the vessels, whose lives and safety indirectly depended upon the lives and safety of the lascars? Was it really consistent with the policy of a great naval country that they should encourage the exclusion of British seamen from one of the great subsidised services by permitting worse accommodation to be given to lascars than would be allowed to British sailors? That was a question the Government had not met, and the Committee were entitled to an assurance that, whatever the decision of the courts might be, fair treatment would be demanded for every sailor, of whatever nationality he might be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03793"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said that the all important question was whether at the present moment the company were allowing the regulation space to the lascars, or whether, in spite of the disallowance of the Board of Trade, they persisted in their violation of the rule. He gathered from the silence of the President of the Board of Trade that the company were persisting in their violation of the rule. If that was the case it was a monstrous position of affairs. After all the years which had
<image src="S4V0094P0I0830"/>
<col>1417</col>
elapsed since the matter was first brought forward, the Board of Trade had called upon the company to obey the law and the company simply presented a Petition of Right, but continued to defy the Board. Even if the Petition of Bight succeeded, it would not substantially alter the merits of the question. A great British line subsidised by the Government should not be allowed to obtain a premium and an advantage over other lines by the exclusion of British labour from its ships. Nobody had proposed that all subsidised lines should be compelled to employ only British labour, although he thought that would not be an unreasonable demand. All that was proposed was that they should be placed under the same regulations with regard to their Asiatic labour as they would be with regard to British labour. But the main strength of the case was that for three years this company had set at defiance the regulations to which every other shipper in the country had to conform, and that no explanation had been given to the House of the deplorable delay which had been tolerated before action was taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03794"><sup>*</sup><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT (Mr. RITCHIE, <memberconstituency>Croydon</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Gentleman opposite has said quite truly that when I had to speak as President of the Board of Trade upon this subject I expressed my own opinion, which was based upon that given me by the law officers of the Crown, that the P. and O. Company were not conforming to the law. In consequence the Board of Trade disallowed the space occupied by the lascar crews whenever the required space was not given. The effect of that, of course, was that the P. and O. Company were compelled to pay much larger dues wherever the ships went than they otherwise would have done. The Board of Trade, therefore, did give effect to the legal advice that they received. That course has never been altered, and, notwithstanding this action which is pending, I understand that the practice is still being followed. The practice of disallowing space has been in operation some time now, and it still continues. The P. and O. Company are, therefore, being penalised on every ship which carries lascar labour out of this country where sufficient space is not
<col>1418</col>
allowed. Whether the view of the Board of Trade or the view of the P. and O. Company that they are not under the English law is the correct one will be decided by the courts, but in the meantime, as has always been the case, the crew space is being disallowed in consequence of the belief of the Board of Trade that the P. and O. Company are not acting in accordance with their obligations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03795"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: But do the P. and O. Company still persist in their course?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03796"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. RITCHIE</member><membercontribution>: Yes, and their crew space is still being disallowed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03797"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said that that disallowance had been going on for the last four or five years. Why did the company continue to defy the law? Because it paid them to do so, as they made more money by refusing to comply with the regulations. The Government were subsidising a company which for four years had set a pretty example to other shipowners of how to defy successfully the Board of Trade and the opinions of the law officers of the Crown. He should certainly take a division on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03798"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON</member><membercontribution> thought the Government were taking up an extraordinary attitude with regard to this question. The P. and O. Company had been penalised for four years, and were still continuing in their course. The obvious inference was that it paid them to do so. The object of inflicting a fine, which was in the nature of a criminal punishment, was not to get the fine, but to stop the crime. But this crime still went on, and the perpetrator of the crime found that it paid to pay the fine and continue the crime. Seeing that the fine did not put a stop to the crime, the Government would have to take some other course, and certainly the last thing they should do was to continue to subsidise the criminal. The obvious duty of the Government was to stop subsidising this particular line as long as it refused; to comply with the regulations. On this ground he thought it was the duty of everyone to support the reduction of the Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03799"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: I desire to say only one word, which I think is necessitated by the last two
<image src="S4V0094P0I0831"/>
<col>1419</col>
speeches we have heard. I do not propose to go into the question of the Board of Trade regulations, or to express an opinion as to the point of law which is before the courts. I desire only to point out that the suggestion that as long as the P. and O. Company refuse to accept the view of the Board of Trade of their obligations we should stop this subsidy is one which cannot be carried out. The subsidy is payable under a contract for a term of years, which has not yet expired. When that term does expire the question may be considered, but until it does expire we cannot do anything with regard to the subsidy.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY ESTIMATES, 1901&#x2013;2.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03821">1. "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;15,977,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge for Transport and Remounts, which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1902."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03822">2. "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;345,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge for the Ordnance Factories (the cost of the Productions of which will be charged to the Army, Navy, and Indian and Colonial Governments), which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1902."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03823">Resolutions read a second time.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03824">First Resolution:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03825"><member>MR. PIRIE <memberconstituency>(Aberdeen, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> thought the very magnitude of this Vote justified further investigation than could be given to it in the few hours discussion of the previous day. He desired particularly to impress upon the Leader of the House that these Votes in regard to operations in South Africa were all discussed on the distinct understanding that the promise of a full inquiry into the conduct of the war was a promise in the general acceptation of the word&#x2014;namely, that a promise was a promise, and not, as the right hon. Gentleman had recently defined it, something to be carried out when the party to whom the promise Was given chose to exact it. In any case,
<col>1428</col>
however, the House would exact the fulfilment of that promise. The item of this Vote with regard to which he had given notice of his intention to move a reduction was for the transport of troops returning from South Africa. From the recent quarterly Returns giving the strength of the garrisons in South Africa on the 1st February and the 1st May last, it appeared that there was an enormous disproportion between the number of officers and the number of men returning home not as invalids compared with the proportion of officers to men remaining in South Africa. According to the Return of 1st February, the number of officers sent home was 1,214, as against 11,109 men&#x2014;a proportion of one officer to nine men; whereas the proportion of officers to men remaining in South Africa was one to thirty-two. That disproportion certainly required some explanation, although he could surmise several good reasons for it. When an explanation was asked on the 5th March the Secretary of State for War merely said the preparation of a Return would entail very considerable labour. But a new Return was not asked for. What was wanted was merely an explanation of the existing Return, and it was no good issuing Returns at all if, when an explanation was asked for, Members were treated in this high-handed fashion. He moved the reduction standing in his name.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03826">Amendment proposed&#x2014;
<quote>"To leave out '&#x00A3;15,977,000,' and insert '&#x00A3;15,990,900,' instead thereof."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Pirie.</i>)</quote></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03827">Question proposed, "That '&#x00A3;15,977,000' stand part of the Resolution."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03828"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution> hoped the Secretary of State for War would give some explanation in regard to this matter. He could quite understand that a large number of these officers had necessarily returned home in consequence of the diminution of the number of generals in South Africa with their large staffs, but
<image src="S4V0094P0I0836"/>
<col>1429</col>
he did not think that that would account for the great disproportion. This was a matter in which the country took a very great interest, and, unless a satisfactory explanation was given, it would be believed that favouritism was at work by which men of high position or officers were allowed to return home much more freely than the men of the rank and file.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03829"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. BRODRICK, <memberconstituency>Surrey, Guildford</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said the explanation was very simple. The exchange of officers must be greater than the exchange of men in a campaign of any magnitude. A number of officers had been summoned from India to replace others, and no doubt a considerable number of officers who had left their staff appointments had come home in order to resume their ordinary duties, It was</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03830">extremely desirable that, in a campaign like the present, officers should not have to bear too long the great strain put upon them by operations in the field. This was a matter of policy, and had nothing to do with the officers themselves, The reason of his refusal a few days before to give the hon. Member the details for which he asked was that in most cases references had to be made, to South Africa for absolute statements from the officer in command of every staff officer who came home to explain the precise cause of his return. That would entail an enormous amount of labour, which at this stage of the campaign was not desirable.</p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03833">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That this House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03834"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> protested against the monstrous waste of public money involved in this Vote. Throughout the discussion in Committee the Government failed to answer any of the criticisms brought forward. Never in his experience had he seen an Estimate drawn up in a more loose, careless, and reckless fashion. The items with regard to transport seemed to be so absurd as to be quite incapable of explanation. In fact, the only possible explanation was that the Government had been so often accused of miscalculation and want of foresight that the War Office clerks had been given instructions to make this Estimate as large as they could, so that by no possibility could a Supplementary Estimate be required. With regard to the remounts, it was admitted on both sides that through carelessness and bad management there had been an enormous slaughter of horses in South Africa. That involved not only a great waste of money, but also horrible cruelty. It was absurd to ask for a further Vote of &#x00A3;3,000,000 for remounts without any assurance being given that the system would be altered. But that was not all, for within the last few days a statement had appeared in <i>The Times</i> from one of its correspondents in South Africa that no horses were available for one of
<col>1432</col>
the Yeomanry battalions, notwithstanding the fact that the men were practically dismounted, the reason given being that all the remounts were required by the new drafts coming out in order that they might practise riding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03835"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution> thought that he was entitled to rely on the evidence of the general commanding the troops in South Africa rather than on that of any correspondent as to the class of horses sent out and the use made of them; and he could hardly be asked to provide more troops and more horses, or better troops and better horses, than Lord Kitchener himself required. So long as he was able&#x2014;without having asked for it&#x2014;to quote Lord Kitchener's opinion in his favour in regard to remounts, he could hardly be called into question. He had already explained that the Vote for sea transport was necessarily nearly as high as last year because the hope was entertained that they would be able to bring home a large proportion of the troops employed at the front. With regard to transport in the colony, they had been able to reduce the Vote largely, because last year large sums had to be paid for the actual provision of transport wagons and various other accessories which were not needed to be repeated this year. Moreover, in many cases better contracts for transports had been made. Lord Kitchener had given his personal attention to this particular business, a business
<image src="S4V0094P0I0838"/>
<col>1433</col>
which he understood probably better than any other man alive, and he had been able to make large reductions in the contracts made and in the cost of conveying troops in South Africa.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03836"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution> said that the complaint was that more than &#x00A3;7,000,000 had been paid during the past year to mount our troops, but nevertheless they had been abominably mounted. To say that Lord Kitchener was perfectly satisfied was like locking the stable door after the steed was stolen. The whole management of this department, from top to bottom, had been of the most shocking description. Before the war commenced he had time after time called the attention of the Government to the need of strengthening the veterinary department, but without success. At present, the veterinary officers in South Africa numbered only one to 7,000 horses. It was true that a number of civilian veterinary surgeons had been sent out, but they were merely the sweepings of the profession, and even counting these there was only one veterinary surgeon to about 200 or 300 horses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03837"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution> pointed out that no money was taken under this Vote for the Army Veterinary Department.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03838"><member>CAPTAIN NORTON</member><membercontribution> said he was dealing with the department only as bearing on the question of remounts. If the animals had been properly cared for the taxpayers would have been called upon to pay a much smaller sum than was now the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03839"><member>MR. O'MARA <memberconstituency>(Kilkenny, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked whether the Vote included any estimate for bringing home the horses. If it was intended only for bringing home the men, how was it that last year, when about a quarter of a million of men and the same number of horses were taken out, the transport cost about &#x00A3;10,000,000, whereas this year to bring home about the same number of men without the horses the estimated cost was nearly the same? If the animals were to be brought</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-03841"><member>THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE WAR OFFICE (Lord STANLEY, <memberconstituency>Lancashire, Westhoughton</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said there was no intention of bringing the horses home. Any horses that could be sold would be sold in South Africa. It was a question whether the nucleus of a remount department should not be formed in South Africa. He believed that in the future South Africa would be able to provide remounts as well as any other part of the Empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03842"><member>MR. CREAN <memberconstituency>(Cork, S.E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> did not believe there would be any necessity to bring home the soldiers that had been sent out to South Africa; they would be required to keep the few remaining Boers in subjection. They would also be required for the protection of the people who were taken out and settled on farms. In fact, it seemed more probable that this money would be required for taking troops out than for bringing soldiers home. The proceedings would, however, be watched very carefully, and if it was found that soldiers were sent out the Secretary of State for War would be reminded of his statement that the money was for the purpose of bringing the troops home.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03843"><member>MR. FLAVIN <memberconstituency>(Kerry, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked how it was calculated that &#x00A3;9,500,000 would be required for the purposes of bringing home 250,000 men? That worked out at about &#x00A3;40 per head, but that was surely a mistake. Perhaps the Financial Secretary could give the Committee the total number of men sent out and the total cost, so that they could see the average price per head.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03844"><member>LORD STANLEY</member><membercontribution> said he had not the actual figures with him, and therefore he could not give the information asked for.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HUMBER COMMERCIAL RAILWAY AND<lb/> DOCK BILL. (BY ORDER.)</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03957">As amended, considered.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03958"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. CHARLES M'ARTHUR <memberconstituency>(Liverpool, Exchange)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he rose to move the omission from Clause 62 of words which put the risks of removal on the master or owner of a ship. The Bill was intended to authorise the construction of a dock and other works at Great Grimsby, on the banks of the Humber, the charging of dues for the use of the docks, the appointment of a dock master and other officials to regulate the movement of vessels in and out of the dock, and the making of by-laws under the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Act, 1847. Words appeared in the clause by which the dock company sought to exempt themselves from their common law liability for damage caused in the removal of ships by the acts of their servants. He thought that if the dock company's servants were guilty of any neglect or default in moving the vessel about the dock, the company ought to be held responsible for any damage thereby caused. The common law said that they were responsible, and he was not aware of any dock or harbour company which had sought thus to amend the common law in that respect. There were many ways in which a vessel might be injured through the neglect of the dock employees. It might be sent into a dock, for instance, where there was an insufficient depth of water, and it might ground on a mud bank or on rubbish or wreckage which had been allowed to accumulate there. It might, while it was in charge of officials of the dock, come into collision with another vessel. In all other ports in the United Kingdom the dock companies were held responsible for damage caused under such conditions, yet under this clause the owner or master of the ship was to be made responsible. This was entirely a new departure, and he believed an unintentional one on the part of the pro-
<col>1448</col>
moters. He could not understand how the clause crept into the Bill. It certainly was not there when it came up for Second Reading. He had been asked by the shipowners of the United Kingdom to move that these words be deleted, and he trusted that the promoters would consent to that being done. In that case there would be no further opposition to the Bill. He begged to move the omission of the words to which he had referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03959"><member>MR. DOUGHTY <memberconstituency>(Great Grimsby)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: On behalf of the promoters of the Bill I desire to withdraw the words referred to.</membercontribution></p>

<title>HAMILTON BURGH PROVISIONAL<lb/> ORDER CONFIRMATION BILL [Lords].<lb/> (BY ORDER.)</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03963">Under Section 7, Sub-section (2) of the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act, 1899.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03964">Order read, for resuming Adjourned Debate on Question [24th May], "That the clause (Water supply to public offices) proposed on consideration be read a second time."&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Advocate.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03965">Question again proposed, "That the clause be read a second time."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03966">Debate resumed&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03967"><member>THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. A. GRAHAM MURRAY, <memberconstituency>Buteshire</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said that after consultation with the War Office he found there was no real necessity for the insertion of this clause, as the military authorities had a perfect right to insist on a supply of water to War Office buildings for domestic purposes. He therefore proposed to ask leave to withdraw it. As some discussion took place on the last occasion as to the desirability of allowing Amendments to be introduced at this stage, he would like to remind the House that when the Private Bill Procedure (Scotland) Act was under considera-
<image src="S4V0094P0I0846"/>
<col>1449</col>
tion provision was specially introduced to allow Amendments to be introduced on consideration, as, unlike the practice in the other House, it was not possible to introduce them on the motion for the Third Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03968"><member>MR. BLAKE <memberconstituency>(Longford, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the point raised on the last occasion was not so much the desirability of introducing Amendments on the consideration stage, but rather the importance of insisting that these matters should be threshed out at the local inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03969"><member>MR. A. GRAHAM MURRAY</member><membercontribution>: There was no local inquiry in this case. It was an unopposed Bill. I quite agree that when there is a local inquiry these clauses should go before it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-03970">Motion, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04040"><member>MR. PLATT-HIGGINS <memberconstituency>(Salford, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether any cases have come to his notice in which the Boers have employed natives for military purposes during the war; whether any cases have been reported in which Boers have flogged natives who they believed had given information to the British or otherwise assisted them; and whether any instances have transpired of natives being found in arms or of attempts having been made by the Boers to induce natives to take up arms against the British.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04041"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Mr. BRODRICK, <memberconstituency>Surrey, Guildford</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: Yes, Sir. During the siege of Ladysmith the Boers employed armed natives on outpost duty at night. At the engagement of Vaal Krantz several Kaffirs fired on the British troops, and some were afterwards found on the ground killed or wounded. The systematic intimidation of natives by the Boers throughout the campaign has been notorious; as regards recent in stances several natives were officially reported to have been shot by the Boers in November last. In February J. J. de Jager was convicted at Harrismith of murdering three natives, and hanged his defence was that in one case he acted under orders, and that in the two other
<col>1456</col>
cases he believed the natives to be spies. Further, I need hardly remind the House of the terrible treatment of Abraham Esau at Calvinia, for which no reason was assigned except his pro-British sympathies.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FALSE INFORMATION FROM THE<lb/> FRONT.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04044"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether, in view of the outrageously false telegrams from South Africa recently sent through Reuter's and other agencies, and the absolute dearth for a long period of any detailed or reliable news of the war and the military situation in South Africa, he will undertake to allow correspondents to go to the front without reference to the politics of the journals they represent, and whether he will see that the censorship is used in future only for military objects, and not for the purpose of keeping the public in the dark as to the situation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04045"><member>MR. WEIR <memberconstituency>(Ross and Cromarty)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: At the same time may I ask whether, in view of Lord Kitchener's denial of the alleged defeat of Beyers's commando, the right hon. Gentleman will state how this telegram came to be passed by the censor, what steps will be taken to prevent correspondents at the seat of war from dispatching false information, and whether correspondents will be deprived of their permits when shown to have communicated false reports respecting operations in the field.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04046"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: Lord Kitchener is considering the circumstances in which the incorrect telegrams complained
<image src="S4V0094P0I0850"/>
<col>1457</col>
of have recently been sent. I will undertake that all such cases are suitably dealt with. I must point out that the censor is not responsible for the accuracy of the telegrams that pass through his hands, but he is responsible that nothing should be telegraphed to this country likely to give information to the enemy. As regards the general dearth of information about which the hon. Member asks, there has been no withholding of information from the House. It is obvious that the reports of the generals are necessarily summaries of the events that have taken place, and those summaries have been duly published. It is impossible for any general to allow a mass of correspondents to accompany the troops in order to represent newspapers of all descriptions. He can only allow a certain number.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04047"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: Will the right hon. Gentleman undertake to allow correspondents to go to the front irrespective of the politics of the journals they represent? It so happens that all the correspondents at the front represent only journals supporting the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04048"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: I have no knowledge of the politics of the journals represented by the correspondents at the front. The matter rests entirely with Lord Kitchener, who, I believe, is in complete ignorance of the politics of all journals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04049"><member>MR. WEIR</member><membercontribution>: Seeing that the Secretary for War has been given a specific case in which the information sent to the newspapers has been false, I should like to ask whether he will take action without delay against the correspondent?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04050"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: I have not yet heard anything of the explanation of the correspondent, and I have told the House that Lord Kitchener will suitably deal with any such cases.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04051"><member>MAJOR RASCH <memberconstituency>(Essex, Chelmsford)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I wish to know whether the right hon. Gentleman will consider the advisability of prosecuting the propagators of false news at home, such as Mr. Stead, particularly in connection with the letter stated to have been written by Lieutenant Morrison?</membercontribution></p>
<col>1458</col>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04052"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: I stated to the House a few days ago that all these false reports are highly discreditable to those who publish them.</membercontribution></p>

<title>LINDLEY DISASTER.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04053"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary for War whether he can state what steps have been taken to ascertain the reason why the 10th Battalion of Imperial Yeomanry and other mounted troops, in all a force of 1,500 men with guns, which was informed on the 23rd May that Colonel Spragge's force was hard pressed at Lindley but could not hold out until Sunday, the 27th, never reached Lindley although it moved out of Kroonstadt on the 23rd, and the distance between Lindley and Kroonstadt is only forty miles; and whether any inquiry has been held; if so, what was the finding of the court.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04054"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member has been misinformed as to the dates. On the 23rd May the 10th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry was at Zandfontein, fourteen miles west of Bothaville, and over fifty miles from Kroonstadt as the crow flies. No inquiry has been held, nor is any deemed necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04055"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: But did not the force actually start and lose its way on the road?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04056"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: I am not so informed. But the distance shows that it could not have reached Lindley in time in any case.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FARM BURNING.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04057"><member>MR. JOHN ELLIS <memberconstituency>(Nottinghamshire Rushcliffe)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether the policy and practice of burning farm buildings, mills, cottages, and other buildings in South Africa for military reasons has been discontinued; and, if so, at what date and on whose instructions; and whether he can supplement the figures given up to the end of January, 1901, in the Return laid before the House by the figures for any and each of the months since, during which this destruction may have been carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04058"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: I informed the House some time ago that, except in
<image src="S4V0094P0I0851"/>
<col>1459</col>

cases of treachery and certain recognised military offences, farm houses would not be burned.

O'SHAUGHNESSY <memberconstituency>(Limerick, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury, as representing the Postmaster General, if he can state why, on the changing of the route of Thomas Liston, rural postman in the districts of Kilmihill, Ballynoe, and Ballyneale, in the county of Limerick, in May, 1900, his usual weekly salary was reduced from 12s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. for no breach of discipline or lack of duty; is he aware that the mileage has not been decreased by the change, but that additional work is the outcome, a house to house collection being now made; that owing to this change Liston was unable to attend Divine worship in Ballingarry on Sundays; and that, on investigation by the officials after a period of ten months, a helper was appointed on Sundays, but Liston's weekly salary still further reduced, and whether this man will be compensated for the reduction in his salary after seven years of service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04127"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: It is the fact, as stated by the hon. Member, that on the revision of Thomas Liston's duty last year his pay was reduced. Under the re-arrangement Liston's walk was extended, but his hours of duty were curtailed, as he now reaches home shortly after 10 a.m. instead of at 7.40 p.m. as formerly. The pay was, however, fixed somewhat below scale, and instructions have now been given for paying him the balance at the scale rate from the date of the alteration. A further extension of the duty has now been authorised,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0858"/>
<col>1473</col>
and in future the pay will be 2s. 6d. a week higher than it is at present. With regard to the Sunday delivery, it is the case that to enable the man to attend Divine service the duty has been reduced, but it has now been decided to maintain the former payment for Sunday work.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MOLASSES AND GLUCOSE.</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04147"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Sir M. HICKS BEACH, <memberconstituency>Bristol, W.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: The Committee will remember that in the Budget resolutions as now embodied in the Finance Bill it was proposed to impose a duty of 2s. per cwt. on molasses and all sugar and extracts from sugar that cannot be tested by the polariscope, and 1s. 8d. per cwt. on glucose. Well, since those resolutions were passed we have been able, of course, to investigate the nature and quality of the articles comprised under those two heads much more exhaustively than was possible before the resolutions were proposed; and I am quite satisfied that the duties imposed by these resolutions on molasses and glucose were not sufficient to guard the sugar revenue, and were not fair to manufacturers here with reference to certain kinds of molasses and glucose, while, on the other hand, they were too high with regard to unexhausted molasses. Among the extracts of sugar which are classed together with molasses in the Bill as it now stands are invert sugar and
<col>1476</col>
other kinds of extracts which contain as much as 80 per cent., I think, of sweetening matter, and which are not at all by-products of raw sugar, as are molasses, but are obtained from raw sugar of a high quality, polarising at from 90 deg. to 93 deg., which would itself pay a duty of 3s. 1d. to 3s. 2d. Therefore it is clear, I think, that to impose a duty of not more than 2s. a cwt. upon articles of that class would result in a very considerable loss to the Revenue, and would also place the foreign producer of such articles in a position of preference to the extent of something like 9d. per cwt., as compared with the manufacturer of such articles here. On the other hand, there is a kind of molasses of very poor quality, largely exhausted in the process of manufacture, which contains a comparatively small amount of sweetening matter, and is used to the extent of 20,000 or 30,000 tons a year for cattle feeding, and also to some extent in the manufacture of blacking, dyes, and other articles. Two shillings per cwt. was too high a rate for any article of that sort. The matter has been brought under my notice from both Scotland and Liverpool, which are interested in these imports. Therefore, in place of the duty on molasses as now proposed in the Finance Bill, I propose that molasses and all sugar and extracts from sugar which cannot be tested by the polariscope, if containing 70 per cent. or more of sweetening matter, shall pay 2s. 9d. per cwt.; if containing less than 70 per cent. and more than 50 per cent. of sweetening matter, 2s. per cwt., as at present in the Bill. That relates, I think, to certain syrups which are largely consumed by the poorer classes. If containing not more than 50 per cent. of sweetening matter, 1s. per cwt. only.<lb/>
With regard to glucose, also, it is necessary to make an alterations The duty of 1s. 8d. on glucose was based on the assumption that glucose contained about 40 per cent. of sweetening matter. We have ascertained that there are two kinds of glucose, one of which, the solid glucose, contains a very much larger amount of sweetening matter than that. It is largely used for brewing purposes, and it is equal in sweetening power to something like 80 per cent. of sugar; and, therefore, solid glucose ought to pay a corresponding duty of about. 2s. 9d.
<image src="S4V0094P0I0860"/>
<col>1477</col>
Liquid glucose has a higher sweetening power than I supposed, varying from 45 to 55 per cent., and therefore I think the duty on that should be 2s. instead of 1s. 8d., as proposed in the Bill. I may say that we have had practical proof that the glucose duty as it now stands in the Finance Bill is insufficient to guard the sugar revenue, because, since the duty was enacted, it is a very remarkable fact that the import of glucose from abroad has been of a much higher sweetening power than that which was formerly sent into this country, so that it is perfectly obvious that it is competing unfairly in the market with sugar. I propose that these duties should commence from to-morrow, and that a similar Excise duty should be levied on molasses and glucose, to take effect also from to-morrow. When the duties on molasses and glucose were originally proposed, it was impossible to propose that the Excise duty should come into force on the same day as the Customs duty, because, as the Committee are aware, in order to levy an Excise duty it is necessary to make arrangements for the manner in which it shall be levied. This can only be done after careful communication with the manufacturers of the article on which the duty is to be levied. That could not take place before the introduction of the Budget; but the matter has now been entirely arranged, and the Inland Revenue authorities inform me that they are prepared to levy the Excise duty on glucose and molasses as from to-morrow, so that both the manufacturers here and abroad will be from that day placed on precisely the same footing. I trust the Committee will be willing to make these alterations in the resolutions, which are, of course, only preliminary to my proposing Amendments to the Finance Bill In order to carry them into effect.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04151"><member>MR. LOUGH <memberconstituency>(Islington, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he thought the House ought to give a little attention to the action which was now being taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. To his mind the proposals of the Finance Bill had not received the consideration which they ought to have done. They were witnessing that afternoon what he might call the first scene in the new drama of Protection which had been set up in this country. They had a graduated scheme under which these new duties were established. It was a subtle scheme of Protection. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had told them that there was no opportunity before the Budget was introduced of inquiry as to the imposition of the Excise duty now proposed but he maintained that they were driven into the difficulties which had necessitated these alterations, because they had accepted the principle of a graduated duty. He believed that it was not until after the introduction of the Budget that the idea of an Excise duty cropped up. He saw no reason, if they were to have one, why it should not have been enforced ever since the 19th April.</membercontribution></p>

He
<image src="S4V0094P0I0861"/>
<col>1479</col>
would like to make an appeal to the leaders of the party to which he belonged to be warned by what was going on that afternoon, and to take a little more interest in the matter. He regretted exceedingly that there was no one on the Front Opposition Bench to say one word of protest against the system which the Chancellor of the Exchequer embodied in the Budget and which he had enlarged that evening. The right hon. Gentlemen the Members for East Wolverhampton, West Monmouth, East Fife, and Montrose Burghs had all given the sugar duty away. The one crumb of comfort he had got was that the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition had not committed himself yet. That was the right hon. Gentleman's great virtue. He waited, with regard to these complicated matters, until he saw the whole plan of the Chancellor of the Exchequer unfolded. They had been told by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Wolverhampton that Mr. Gladstone and Sir George Cornewall Lewis had both imposed a sugar duty. But the circumstances were not altogether analogous. It was a terrible thing for this country, after twenty-five years of freedom from a duty of this nature, to have it reimposed, especially under the complicated conditions now suggested, conditions which, in view of the enormous consumption of the article taxed, must cause great inconvenience. Mr. Gladstone and Sir George Cornewall Lewis had not had to act after a period of twenty-five years freedom from the duty; they only varied it, in fact, and he therefore appealed to the Leader of the Opposition, who, as he had pointed out, had not yet committed himself, to closely watch the proceedings of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. There were great issues involved which must inevitably lead to considerable discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04154"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES <memberconstituency>(Lynn Regis)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that, as he understood the Chancellor of the Exchequer's proposal, the effect was to put glucose on the same footing as sugar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04155"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: Yes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04156"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution> said that, in that case, the right hon. Gentleman's
<col>1480</col>
resolution was a very proper one. But it appeared to him that an element was being introduced as a subject of taxation which was not proposed to be taxed by the Finance Bill. That was sweetening matter. He would like to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what he meant by sweetening matter, and how the amount of sweetening; matter was to be ascertained. He wished it to be understood that he was not complaining of the right hon. Gentleman's proposal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04157"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution> said that in the Finance Bill, as it now stood, under the head of "molasses" other articles were included in the words "and all sugar and extracts from sugar which cannot be tested by the polariscope." The polariscope could not be applied to these articles, and they were grouped together as one thing, so that a certain duty might be levied upon them. It had been discovered that they varied very much in their sweetening matter, and obviously it was necessary to make a difference between them in order to protect the sugar revenue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04158"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the Chancellor of the Exchequer had now proposed a radical change in the resolution which was formerly brought forward. He had announced that if the Bill were passed in the shape in which it was drafted, they would be unwittingly putting on a large protective duty with regard to glucose and certain forms of molasses. That was a very good illustration of the effect of putting a tax on an article which entered largely into the manufactures of the country. If, when the Government brought in the Bill, the two or three Members on the Opposition side of the House who had taken an interest in the question had brought Forward the theory which the Chancellor of the Exchequer now stated, they would have been laughed at. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer had not made this proposal now the result would have been that a protective measure would have been passed without perhaps more than ten Members knowing what was being done. The Chancellor of the Exchequer told them now that the resolution would prevent this being a protective measure.
<image src="S4V0094P0I0862"/>
<col>1481</col>
How were they to know that? They had simply the Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement. How many members of the Committee were in a position to say that they understood what was meant by Copeland's test, by which it was proposed to ascertain the amount of sweetening matter in sugar and molasses? They were going blindly in this matter on the word of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who admitted that he did not understand the subject. Unless the right hon. Gentleman was able to give a fuller explanation of the method by which the sweetening power of those various substances was to be tested, it was preposterous to ask the House of Commons to pass a measure which might be a protective measure. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had at this stage introduced for the first time the expression "sweetening matter." What was sweetening matter? The Committee had received no definition. It was not sugar, and if the right hon. Gentleman meant the power of certain articles to impart sweetness, then he ought to draw a distinction between beetroot sugar and cane sugar. Cane sugar had greater sweetening power than an equal quantity of beetroot sugar. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had drafted and introduced the Finance Bill in blank ignorance as to the relative sweetening powers of liquid and solid glucose. What difficulty was there in getting that information as to the difference earlier from the chemists or experts on whose advice he relied? He must have had at his command confidential men at Somerset House, who could have told him the difference between liquid and solid glucose. The hon. Member did not see the slightest ground for the position taken up now by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, seeing that he was in a position to make inquiry and to get the information before he introduced the resolution. Surely it was not beyond the ingenuity of modern chemists to liquefy solid glucose, and if that were done the whole structure of the new financial resolution would be knocked on the head. He thought it was the most extraordinary doctrine ever introduced in the House of Commons that a most complicated financial provision
<col>1482</col>
should be based on the assumption that the present relations between the sweetening powers of solid and liquid glucose would remain unchanged. This was only a proof of the vicious character of the tax. An extraordinary revolution was being introduced in the financial system of the country. He had watched with amazement the docility with which the House of Commons had accepted this extraordinary change. It was a tax, in his opinion, which combined in itself every possible objection to a tax. It was a tax on an essential and most valuable article of the food of the people. Already the price of blacking and biscuits had been raised. He was informed that Huntley and Palmer had raised the price of their biscuits, and even of those which contained no sugar at all. [Laughter.] Hon. Members laughed, but that was a fact. Peek, Frean, and Company had sent out a circular stating that they had been compelled to raise the price of all their biscuits without reference to the question whether they contained sugar or not. The tax would be very costly to levy, and it would be impossible, at least for several years, to be quite certain whether or not it was discriminating against the manufacturers of this country and in favour of manufacturers abroad. It was a tax which sinned against all the great canons by which the financiers of the last fifty years had been guided in bringing the finance of this country to a state of perfection which had made it the envy of every expert throughout the world. On these grounds he would resist the tax at every possible stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04159"><member>MR. CHAPLIN <memberconstituency>(Lincolnshire, Sleaford)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the hon. Member for East Mayo had charged the Chancellor of the Exchequer with desiring to impose a graded duty on sugar. It appeared to him that the object of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to place glucose and sugar of different qualities upon an entirely equal footing so far as he could. It was impossible for obvious reasons that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make exhaustive inquiries into this subject before bringing forward the proposal. If, of course, the right hon. Gentleman had made such inquiries everybody would have known what one of the principal
<image src="S4V0094P0I0863"/>
<col>1483</col>
features of the Budget was to be before the time came for explaining it. The hon. Member for East Mayo complained that he did not understand all the details of the chemical tests on this question. How many Members would be able to understand them unless they had some special chemical education? The Chancellor of the Exchequer had at his command the advice of able and experienced experts, and he had taken their opinion. It was no doubt on their advice that the changes he now proposed were made. The hon. Member for East Mayo wanted to know how many Members of the House of Commons had even the beginnings of an understanding of the question, and went on to say that he did not believe half a dozen did. He thought the hon. Member was perfectly right, and that the hon. Member himself could not be included in the number. The inference he drew from the statement was, what a blessing it would be if a few Members could recognise their want of information on certain subjects, and that they were not qualified, although ready, to talk on all possible occasions. After all, the speech of the hon. Member was an attack more than anything else on the sugar duty branch of the Budget; but whether it was right or wrong to impose a duty on sugar, at any rate that duty had already been agreed to by the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04160"><member>SIR H. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN <memberconstituency>(Stirling Burghs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The objects proposed by the right hon. Gentleman are of an exceedingly technical and complicated character, and he will not expect, I am sure, the ordinary Member of Parliament to be able either to follow exactly what he said or to appreciate the rights and the wrongs of any question which might be raised in the matter. All I can say is that it will be the duty of us all to get such information as we can as to the general effect of the duty which the right hon. Gentleman proposes, which seems to me, roughly speaking, in the direction of that equal treatment of these different commodities which certainly ought to be the object which we should seek to obtain. I think that some of us should look at the question very closely, not from the general point of view of the
<col>1484</col>
sugar duty, which is hardly before the Committee to-day, but from the point of view of the effect of its details upon Protection, and the consequences that may follow to different branches of the trade of this country from the duties that are proposed. Now, there is one matter to which my attention has been called, and which, as represented to me, seems highly deserving of attention, namely, the duty charged upon the sugar in canned fruits. The duty has been, I believe, imposed on the sugar in canned fruits far exceeding the proportion of duty that ought to have fallen upon it, and in that way a considerable industry is injuriously affected and a protective effect is created, and it will lead, no doubt, to a considerable increase in the price to the consumer in this country. In a matter so diffused as this, the use of sugar in manufactures, where there are so many developments of industry and ingenuity in the employment of sugar in various commodities, I think we may be sure that there will be cases of this sort which will require the attention of the Committee. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman's attention has been particularly called to the point to which I refer, nor do I know that it would require to be dealt with in Committee, but I hope he will be able to give a satisfactory explanation of the circumstance to which I have referred. For the present moment, I think we are hardly in a position to say "Aye" or "No" to the detailed changes which the right hon. Gentleman has intimated to us, but it will be our duty to press inquiry before we get out of Committee on the Finance Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04161"><member>SIR MARK STEWART <memberconstituency>(Kirkcudbrightshire)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that, however much the proposal of the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be criticised from a hostile point of view by hon. Gentlemen opposite, it would meet with great acceptance from agriculturists generally. He spoke with some knowledge on this subject. He had been somewhat startled by the fact that by the first resolution brought into the House the tax on molasses would have amounted to 2s. a cwt., or 12s. a barrel, which seemed to him a particularly heavy tax on a valuable cattle food.
<image src="S4V0094P0I0864"/>
<col>1485</col>
He, however, did not intend to enlarge on the topic, but he simply wished to thank his right hon. friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer for looking into this matter, and bringing this new resolution before the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04162"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON <memberconstituency>(Devonport)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he could not avoid protesting against what he regarded as the utter unsound ness of the whole financial scheme of the present Government, and he would take every opportunity of pro testing against each detail of it. They knew that the Chancellor of the Ex chequer had consistently asserted that the proposals in regard to the sugar duty were not protective. As a matter of fact, whether the tax on molasses as originally introduced was or was not protective, it could not be denied that the right hon. Gentleman was now proposing to introduce a graduated tax on molasses; in fact, the right hon. Gentleman was now proposing three taxes for one. He was perfectly well aware that, technically speaking, the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer could not be described as protective, simply because the right hon. Gentleman proposed to put on an Excise duty corresponding to the Customs duties. But he maintained that the evils which would result from these proposals were similar to the evils arising from protection pure and simple. He would point out that during the last twenty-four or twenty-six years sugar had not only become a staple article of the food of the people, but the raw material on which several small trades had been founded. Therefore to tax the raw material of these trades was to produce the very evils of which they complained from a purely protective tax. He would point out that foreign countries which gave bounties on the exports of sugar made a pure present to this country of so much sugar, and it was owing to that present that these small industries had been started. These small industries depended for their prosperity essentially on the cheapness of sugar, and that cheapness of sugar again depended on the sugar being admitted duty free. Take, for instance, the jam trade, which now employed five times the number of people that had been employed by all the sugar refineries in the country. More-
<col>1486</col>
over, we were able to make a profit out of the very foreign countries who made us a present of this sugar through their export bounties, and we were exporting large quantities of jam abroad.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04163"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: Order, order&#x0021; All that the hon. Gentleman can discuss on this resolution is the variation caused by the proposed changes in the duties on sugar substitutes and molasses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04164"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON</member><membercontribution> said he would endeavour not to transgress the Chairman's ruling. He would put his point in a slightly different way. The Chancellor of the Exchequer's proposal, he maintained, would still further increase the price of sugar, and thereby produce an increased evil of the character he had indicated&#x2014;an evil which existed to a small extent in the original proposals of the Budget. He would like, if he might, inasmuch as the question had been mentioned in debate, to refer to the assertion of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Wolverhampton and the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer that they claimed the authority of Mr. Gladstone in regard to an increased tax on sugar.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04165"><sup>*</sup><member>THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: No authority was claimed in regard to the increase of the tax on sugar, but in regard to the imposition of a tax on sugar. The hon. Member is now trying to get round the ruling I have given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04166"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON</member><membercontribution> said he was under the impression that the analogy was that Mr. Gladstone had increased the tax on sugar, not that he had imposed it. But he would leave that point, and only remark in conclusion that he trusted the leaders on that side of the House would endeavour to rid themselves of one particular attitude of mind in regard to the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that there were those who supported the sugar tax as bad finance merely because bad finance would punish those who took a different view from them in regard to the war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04167"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. CHARLES McARTHUR <memberconstituency>(Liverpool, Exchange)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he was glad that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had
<image src="S4V0094P0I0865"/>
<col>1487</col>
intimated his intention of reducing the duty on the lower class of molasses. Treacle was largely imported for making feeding cakes for cattle, and if the duty on that treacle had been left at the very high figure in the original Budget resolution it would have practically stopped the trade and been detrimental to agriculture. He would have liked to have seen molasses not used for human food exempted from the duty altogether; but as that was impossible he thanked the Chancellor of the Exchequer for making the reduction he had done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04168"><member>MR. KEARLEY <memberconstituency>(Devonport)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had been very slow to convince as to the necessity of maintaining this tax on glucose. The right hon. Gentleman had disregarded the information brought to his notice in the House; and it seemed extraordinary that there should not have been some inquiry on his part as to the incidence of the duty. He should like to point out to the right hon. Gentleman that his proposal would not fully meet the case in regard to glucose. He was perfectly certain that unless the right hon. Gentleman imposed the full sugar duty on glucose it would lead to the Chancellor of the Exchequer being defrauded by foreign firms, and most assuredly it would lead to the consumer being defrauded. He would give proof of what he had stated. In the first place, the brewer would always show a great preference for the cheap article. Now that there was a differentiation between the duties on sugar and glucose he would show a greater preference than ever for the cheaper and less desirable article. But it must not be forgotten that the brewer paid a beer duty on the specific gravity of the liquid, that was to say, on the wort; and the specific gravity of the liquid produced from glucose and the specific gravity of the liquid produced from sugar was exactly the same. The result would inevitably be that we should have beer less pure than before; it would be a glucose beverage altogether; and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not receive from the brewer the amount of taxation to which he was justly entitled. The Conservative party had always been regarded as the friends of "the trade" as it was called, and in re-arranging
<col>1488</col>
the burden the Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider the differentiation between the duties on sugar and glucose. What was the effect on the consumer? When the consumer purchased an article containing sugar he expected to get pure sugar, but the result of the differentiation between the duties on glucose and sugar would be that the manufacturer would displace pure sugar and put in this impure article that was already rapidly taking place, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer was encouraging this. The right hon. Gentleman showed a lamentable lack of knowledge in this matter. He admitted that glucose was largely used, and when questions were put to him as to whether it was or was not adulteration, he said he did not appear to know much about it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04169"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: I said it was illegal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04170"><member>MR. KEARLEY</member><membercontribution> said the right hon. Gentleman said it had been appealed against, but he did not appear to know that the judgment of the court of first instance had been upheld on that appeal. We did not want to be in a state of glucose saturation; we had to drink glucose beer; we did not want glucose in everything. He strongly urged that the duty on glucose should be put up to a level with the highest sugar duty, and he hoped the Chancellor of the Exchequer would give some consideration to that matter in his reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04171"><member>MR. GODDARD <memberconstituency>(Ipswich)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he did not understand from the speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer what would be the result of this change in the duty so far as the Exchequer was concerned, or what would be the result so far as the revenue was concerned. When he replied the Chancellor of the Exchequer would perhaps give some consideration to that point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04172"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. TAYLOR <memberconstituency>(Lancashire, Radcliffe)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the very fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to increased one tax by over 60 per cent. and to reduce another by 50 per cent. was a lesson to the House as to the difficulties and dangers of meddling with subjects with which, not only the Chancellor of the
<image src="S4V0094P0I0866"/>
<col>1489</col>
Exchequer, but certainly the House at large were not qualified to deal. He did not for a moment believe that the Chancellor of the Exchequer meant to do any harm to the commercial interests of the country; but the fact that within two months of the passing of taxes of this importance it was found necessary to impose such a great change should be a warning to the House not to embark in this particular form of taxation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04173"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. STEVENSON <memberconstituency>(Suffolk, Eye)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> disclaimed any desire to embark upon a discussion of the taxation of molasses, which was a technical subject with which he was not prepared to deal. No doubt the reduction of the tax upon molasses would by some be considered a boon to the agricultural classes, but he considered if it were it was of a very qualified nature, as the particular kind of molasses affected made more fat than meat, when used as feeding stuffs. With regard to glucose and other sweetening substances akin to sugar, they should not pay a less duty than sugar, and the only question was whether this particular rise in the duty of glucose was calculated to meet that object. If a particular tax was imposed upon sugar a tax, at least equal in amount, ought to be imposed on articles of food akin to sugar. Whether such a thing would be done by this tax was extremely doubtful. He trusted that when this matter was more fully considered in Committee the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be open to conviction and amenable to such suggestions as were offered, and that he would see his way to mete out to glucose and other substances used in place of sugar the same treatment as he meted out to sugar itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04174"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: It is my desire that, so far as the sweetening powers of sugar on one side and of glucose on the other are concerned, the duty should be equal. But my mind is absolutely open with regard to the further discuss on of the matter in Committee. I have made this proposal to the Committee, which, despite the remarks of the hon. Member for Devonport, is a very large increase in the duty on glucose, in the belief that practically sugar and solid glucose will be put on an equality.
<col>1490</col>
As to the effect of the changes on the revenue, the duty is increased to a large extent on solid glucose, and to a lesser extent on liquid glucose, but with regard to a very considerable part of molasses and other kinds of sugar the duty is largely lowered, and though I should think that on the whole there will be some increase on the total yield of the duties on molasses and glucose, I do not, think it will be a very large one.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04180">Clause 1:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04181"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE <memberconstituency>(Northampton)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the intention of the Amendment he desired to move was to deal with the question of whether the hereditary revenues derived from the Crown lands and other sources really belonged to the King in his personal capacity or in his capacity of head of the State. In the preamble of the Bill the House was told that these had been given up by the King, but the preamble of a Bill did not make law, and the fact that in the preamble he gave them up did not give the King, in his personal capacity, any title to these hereditary revenues. He believed that no lawyer would venture to assert that these hereditary revenues belonged personally to the sovereign, except as the head and representative of the State. In 1872 a Report was made by the Treasury upon divers matters connected with finance, and in an exhaustive appendix to that Report the whole question of the hereditary revenues was treated&#x2014;whence they were derived and to whom they belonged; and no one, he submitted, could read that official document without coming to the conclusion that the whole idea of the hereditary revenues belonging to the sovereign was about as much a myth as any telegram

<col>1491</col>
of Reuter's from the seat of war. Up to 1688 there was no such thing as a Civil List at all. Up to then the hereditary revenues belonged entirely to the State, and were devoted to the government of the State, and no distinction was made as to what the monarch was to spend on his family. What was now called the Civil List came into existence at the time of William and Mary, when the funds were voted and certain sources were reserved from which money was to be derived; but there was no pretence that they belonged to the sovereign in any way, and the House of Commons had a right to vote or refuse them as it chose. In the reign of Anne certain revenues were charged, but even then there was no idea that they in any way belonged to the sovereign. It was acknowledged then that they belonged to the country, and portions of them were taken and devoted to special purposes. In the reigns of George I. and George II. the same rule applied. In the reign of George III. the arrangement was much the same; but it was in that reign that in the preamble of the Act the King said he gave up the hereditary revenues from Crown lands, etc., and the same renunciation was performed in the preambles of the Acts of George IV., William IV., and Victoria. But could any lawyer say, after the facts which had been set forth by the official Report of 1872, that there was any right in the sovereign to hold these revenues as his own property? Such a right was not derived before the Revolution of 1688, and it was certainly not derived afterwards. The only reason the remuneration was put into the preambles of the Acts of George I., George II., and George III. was that, although those sovereigns had recognised that the larger hereditary revenues belonged to the State, they had not so recognised the smaller ones. This was considered unfair, and therefore it was specially inserted in the Civil List of William IV. that these smaller revenues, as well as the hereditary revenues, were given up. The Crown had absolutely no title to the Crown lands, or to any other hereditary revenues. The mistake had crept in apparently owing to the action of Lord Bute. If it were merely the old-fashioned mode of showing respect to the Crown, he should not have
<col>1492</col>
protested against it, but it was more than that. The Chancellor of the Exchequer himself had said that as a consideration for the House granting the Civil List, the Crown had given up this personal property. But that point was not taken into consideration at all. In granting the Civil List, no account was taken of the relation it would bear to the amount the Crown lands brought in, but a sum was granted which the House thought fitting to the dignity and the maintenance of the Crown. He therefore protested against this statement being dragged into one Civil List after another. There ought always to be a protest raised against it. The principle should be kept alive that the sovereign should have no personal estates, and that so far as the Crown lands, etc., were concerned the sovereign owned no personal property. He therefore moved the Amendment standing in his name.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman has given us a very learned and interesting disquisition upon the history of Crown lands, but I confess I cannot for the life of me see how his premisses lead to his conclusions, or what benefit he desires to gain for his Amendment. The hon. Member says that there is no doubt the Crown lands do not belong to the Crown. I should say there is no doubt that the Crown lands do belong to the Crown, and every lawyer in the House, I suppose, would confirm that statement. The Crown lands belong to the Crown, and the sovereign could, if he had not made renunciation like that contained in this Bill, spend the money precisely as he chose. It may be perfectly true that in the days when there was no Civil List, in the more primitive days of British Monarchy, the Crown lands not only defrayed the cost of the sovereign's household and personal expenses, but a

large part of the expenses of running the government of the country. But no lawyer would say, in the absence of a renunciation by the Crown, that it would not be in the power of the Crown to spend the revenues of the Crown lands according to the will of the sovereign for the time being. Under these circumstances I cannot see what would be gained by the Amendment of the hon. Gentleman. It is in the highest degree improbable that the time will ever arrive when a sovereign of this country would</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04188">Clause agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04189">Clause 2:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04190"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> said his next Amendment dealt with the amount of money proposed to be voted by Parliament for the King's Civil List. He proposed that the amount should be &#x00A3;415,000 instead of &#x00A3;470,000. Hon. Members did not realise that the funds of the Duchy of Lancaster formed part of the Civil List and brought it up to &#x00A3;530,000. The late Queen Victoria was voted a Civil List of &#x00A3;385,000 at a time when the revenue of the Duchy of Lancaster, instead of producing &#x00A3;60,000 as at present, only produced &#x00A3;12,000. Many years ago a Liberal Government proposed &#x00A3;50,000 a year to the late Prince Consort, but the Conservatives at that time were so sound in certain matters connected with finance that, backed up by the Radicals in the House of Commons, the amount was reduced to &#x00A3;30,000. It seemed to be thought by some gentleman to be a crime of <i>lese majest&#x00E9;</i>, when the Government proposed a sum of money either for the sovereign or a royal prince, to propose a reduction. He was prepared to vote whatever sum was actually required, but he was not ready, upon vague general observations such as were found in the Report of the majority of the Civil List Committee, to vote more than he thought was really necessary. The revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster had increased largely in recent years, and taking them at &#x00A3;60,000, and including &#x00A3;30,000 for the Prince Consort, which would have remained had he lived, the Civil List of Her Majesty would have been &#x00A3;475,000 as against this &#x00A3;530,000, which they were now called upon to vote. Although that Civil List was much smaller than the one proposed now, it amply sufficed for Her Majesty. A good deal was made upon the Committee of the fact that during the last few years Class III. of the present List exceeded the amount set down in the Civil List during the last five years of Her Majesty's reign by &#x00A3;11,000. He thought the Chancellor of the Exchequer would admit that the expenses of His Majesty's
<col>1498</col>
Household did not exceed the amount at which they stood at the commencement of the reign of Queen Victoria. The ceremonial expenditure in Class II. had been reduced. The amount for salaries had been reduced by doing away with sinecure offices to the extent of &#x00A3;15,000, and the class had also been reduced &#x00A3;6,000 by the abolition of the Royal Buckhounds. The pensions which would fall to be paid were reduced by about &#x00A3;10,000. When the Civil List of Queen Victoria was arranged considerable reductions were made with respect to political offices, and some were abolished altogether, but that was considered in the amount. But here, though the expenditure was reduced, that was not taken into consideration in the amount. The amount of the Civil List was raised, and the amount to be paid out of it was reduced. There was the one item of "personal staff" added, which was really no addition. Personal staff in the reign of Queen Victoria came out of the privy purse, and now it was made a separate class of its own. In looking over the expenditure of the late Queen he found a large amount put down for Balmoral and Osborne. These palaces belonged to Her Majesty, but he held to the old Whig doctrine that the sovereign ought to hold no personal property of his or her own. The sovereign should give up his personal estates to relatives, if they liked, and should be entirely dependent upon the amount of money voted by the House of Commons. If they had to consider not only what was necessary for the sovereign, but also what was necessary to maintain Balmoral and Sandringham, the Civil List might be raised in order to keep up estates which were of no value to the country. The result of this was that the privy purse had increased enormously. Although there were reductions in the class, the total amount of the privy purse would be &#x00A3;200,000, which, with all respect to the Sovereign, he was bound to say he thought was somewhat excessive. He wished not only that the Sovereign should have enough to maintain himself in comfort, but that the Court should be conducted with decent magnifi-

<col>1499</col>
cence. He did not, and never would, agree to the doctrine laid down by the majority of the Committee upstairs, that they should never place any restriction upon the hospitality of the Sovereign. If that was true, they were violating their own rule in asking &#x00A3;470,000. If that was true, what they ought to do was to give the Sovereign power freely to draw what he wished from the Treasury. They knew that the Queen's Court was kept with what he would call decent magnificence, and he was not aware that the present Court required more. A few belonging to the privileged classes who went to the entertainments wanted more to be granted than the late Queen received. He could only say that he never heard of one of his constituents being asked to the functions. This was a little Society matter, and he thought that, in view of the lavish and ostentatious hospitality practised by certain persons in this country who had grown suddenly rich, the Court should set an example of decent hospitality.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04193"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR F. DIXON-HARTLAND <memberconstituency>(Middlesex, Uxbridge)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he was very sorry the hon. Member for Northampton had moved this Amendment. It was clearly proved in the Committee upstairs that it was most desirable, in the interest of His Majesty and of the country, that proper provision should be made for the Crown. It was considered that a large expenditure would be required to keep up the dignity and honour of the office, and that it would be far wiser that an amount should be given which would be satisfactory in that way, so that His Majesty should not be obliged to run into debt, because they had made an improper allowance to him. The King had to keep up his Court in very much the same way as other monarchs in Europe had to do. The monarchical principle was fixed in the minds of the people of Europe, and therefore it was desirable that we should keep up the Crown in exactly the same way as was done in other countries. There was
<col>1500</col>
only one country in Europe which at present was not a monarchy. That was France. He was in Paris when the Czar of Russia was there, and had an opportunity of mixing with the people and hearing their sentiments. The feeling he heard expressed on all sides was that they ought to have a monarchy of their own. In discussing this question they ought to consider what had been done abroad. He would give a few figures showing what other countries had done. A comparison of the expenditure equivalent to that of the Civil List in European countries showed the amounts to be:&#x2014;In Russia, &#x00A3;2,750,382; Prussia, &#x00A3;785,965; Austria, &#x00A3;775,000; Italy, &#x00A3;642,000; Great Britain, including all the grants to the Royal Family, &#x00A3;590,000; Spain, &#x00A3;370,000; Bavaria, &#x00A3;275,158; Saxony, &#x00A3;188,960; Belgium, &#x00A3;140,000; Sweden, &#x00A3;112,000; Portugal, &#x00A3;80,300; Holland, &#x00A3;66,666; and Denmark, &#x00A3;66,200. In republican France the amount was &#x00A3;426,240, and in the United States &#x00A3;442,625. That worked out per head of the population as follows:&#x2014;Saxony, 11&#x00B7;97<i>d.</i>; Bavaria, 11&#x00B7;35<i>d.</i>; Denmark, 7&#x00B7;27<i>d.</i>; Prussia, 5&#x00B7;92<i>d.</i>; Russia, 5&#x00B7;12<i>d.</i>; Spain, 4&#x00B7;99<i>d.</i>; Belgium, 4&#x00B7;98<i>d.</i>; Italy, 4&#x00B7;84<i>d.</i>; Austria, 4&#x00B7;16<i>d.</i>; Portugal, 3&#x00B7;82<i>d.</i>; Sweden, 3&#x00B7;72<i>d.</i>; Great Britain, 3&#x00B7;46<i>d.</i>; France, 2&#x00B7;66<i>d.</i>; and the United States, 1&#x00B7;69<i>d.</i> But if they took off the value of the Crown lands which was dealt with under the last Amendment it really worked out at a penny per head of the population in this country. He thought they would find that nothing could be cheaper than the amount we had to pay in this country in comparison with other countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04194"><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE <memberconstituency>(Merthyr Tydvil)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the extraordinary figures they had listened to from the hon. Baronet the Member for the Uxbridge Division certainly came as a surprise to him. There was a time in the history of this country when the Civil List included the whole cost of government, apart from the Army and Navy. The figures cited by the hon. Baronet showed that this House was asked to vote to the King and Queen a larger sum than sufficed in the United States for the entire government, including the payment of Members of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S4V0094P0I0872"/>
<col>1501</col>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04195"><member>SIR F. DIXON-HARTLAND</member><membercontribution> said that if in the United States they indulged in the luxury of paying senators the cost was included in the figure he had quoted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04196"><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE</member><membercontribution> remarked that that was exactly his point. What the hon. Baronet invited the Committee to do was to vote for the King and Queen of England, for their own personal use, a larger sum than was given for the entire government of the United States. If the hon. Baronet was prepared to move an Amendment that King Edward should, out of his Civil List, pay the Members of this House, he would vote for the Amendment. There were two points on which he would invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give some information before the question went to the vote. When the subject was last under discussion he asked whether the &#x00A3;50,000, included in the &#x00A3;110,000 for the privy purse, which was supposed to be voted to the Queen, would be paid to Her Majesty direct, or to the King, leaving him to dispose of it as he saw fit. Unless the sum was to be paid to her direct, he would move a further Amendment to this clause at the proper stage. If this House voted a sum of money to Queen Alexandra, the more popular of the two&#x2014;[Cries of "Oh&#x0021;" and "Order&#x0021;"]&#x2014;he would speak the truth even if it did not please hon. Members opposite. If this House voted a sum of money to Her Majesty, they should be sure that it was paid to her direct. He also asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the King continued to hold various commissions which he formerly held in the Army, and, if so, whether he was paid for holding these positions. He found that His Majesty was a Field Marshal on the Active List and colonel of several regiments. Evidently His Majesty did not believe in "one man one job." He should vote for the Amendment because he thought the sum which it specified was more than sufficient. The late Queen and Prince Consort, with a young and increasing family, had a total income for the privy purse of about &#x00A3;100,000 a year, whereas the sum that was to be voted now to the King and Queen, for whose family separate provision was made, was close on &#x00A3;200,000. He submitted that this

<col>1502</col>
was to set an example of wasteful extravagance which at a time like this would be injurious to the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04197"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON</member><membercontribution> said it seemed to him to be idle to compare the expenditure which might take place during the present reign with what was spent towards the close of the last reign. During the last forty years the sovereign was almost practically in retirement, for reasons which they all knew. We must go back to a period not later than 1861 for the purpose of comparison. Moreover, in making such a comparison, they must remember that during the last forty years there had been a most remarkable increase in the number and extent of great properties in this country. It had been estimated that within the next thirty years, by the falling in of leases, the capital value of the property of one landlord, in a town which was not London, would be increased by &#x00A3;40,000,000. They knew that for many years to come there was not the slightest chance of our giving up the monarchical system in this country; and he held, from a purely democratic point of view, that it would be a danger to the country if the monarch were not among the wealthiest men in the country. The sovereign must have great influence in the State, and he was not prepared to submit the sovereign to the temptations of undue influence, and to run the risk of increasing the power of those men whose properties had become so great within the last forty years, a power that was already a social danger.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04198"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: I think it is not necessary to detain the Committee at any length in regard to the proposals of the hon. Member for Northampton. The hon. Member has stated to the Committee precisely the views which he stated to the Committee upstairs, and that Committee decided against him, not merely by a majority, for he could get no one to support his views. I am not disposed to compare the Civil List with that of other countries, or to discuss the view expressed by the hon. Member who has just sat down. But I do think that the proposals which the Government submitted to the Committee upstairs, and to which that Committee agreed unanimously,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0873"/>
<col>1503</col>
with the exception of the hon. Member for Northampton, if they erred, erred on the side of moderation. I rise merely to answer a question asked by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydvil with regard to the colonelcies held by the King in the Army. Those are purely honorary appointments. His Majesty is, I believe, colonel of more than one regiment, but he receives not one single penny in respect</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04202"><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE</member><membercontribution> said he rose for the purpose of moving the addition of certain words to the clause as it stood. Naturally they were all pleased to hear the statement of the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to the effect that a certain amount from the privy purse was to be devoted to the use of Her Majesty the Queen. But the question was, what was that amount to be? He thought the House of Commons should have something to say in deciding what proportion of the Civil List should be paid to Her Majesty. In these days of woman's rights and all the rest of it, it seemed but right and proper that the House of Commons should decide how much Her Majesty was to receive out of the sum they had just voted. His Amendment was to add after Clause 2 the words, "&#x00A3;50,000 of which sum shall be paid to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra for her sole and separate use." He hoped that whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the total amount of the privy purse, there would not be any great difference of opinion as to the desirability of the nation saying, through its representatives, what proportion of it was to be paid to the Queen. He could not speak from personal knowledge, but he was told that it was common to provide marriage portions, pin-money, and other allowances to wives, and the proposal he now submitted would carry out that idea. The King, despite his great qualities, was, after all, but human, and it might prove too great a temptation to him were he to be allowed an undisputed sway as to how the privy purse was to be disposed of. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer could assure the Committee that some reasonable part of the &#x00A3;110,000 of the privy purse was to be paid to Her Majesty direct, then it was needless to say he would not seek to press his Amendment; but failing any such assurance, as a matter of principle and as a matter of precaution, he would invite the Committee</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04206"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: The proposal of the Committee and the proposal of the Bill really is that the privy purse should be their Majesties' jointly. That follows exactly the precedent of the Civil List Act of King William IV. and Queen Adelaide. For that reason I do not consider the Amendment of the hon. Member is advisable, and I cannot accept it. I do not see any reason to conceal from the House, what I communicated to the Committee upstairs, that the amount which will be paid to Her Majesty the Queen will be &#x00A3;33,000 a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04207"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> said he was bound to say that he thought the arrangement was not one to which the House ought to agree. The late Queen had &#x00A3;60,000 voted for her privy purse. The King, following the precedent of King William IV. and Queen Adelaide, was to receive &#x00A3;110,000; that was to say, &#x00A3;50,000 in excess of Her late Majesty. If His Majesty were not married, obviously it would be considered that &#x00A3;60,000 would be amply sufficient. Surely, therefore, it would have been understood, without the present explanation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that Her Majesty Queen Alexandra was to receive the extra amount, and that was the reason for increasing the privy purse from &#x00A3;60,000 to &#x00A3;110,000. If his hon. friend went to a division he should vote with him.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04210">Clause agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04211">Clause 3:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04212">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That Clause 3 stand part of the Bill."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04213"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> said he had looked into history with reference to the subject matter of this clause. He found that Prince Frederick, son of George II., received, including the revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall, &#x00A3;52,000. The Prince wanted more, as was the habit of most people, but the House of Commons refused to increase the sum. On the death of Prince Frederick the Prince
<col>1512</col>
of Wales&#x2014;afterwards George III.&#x2014;had &#x00A3;20,000, which was increased to &#x00A3;40,000 per annum. George IV., who was a somewhat expensive gentleman, received as Prince of Wales &#x00A3;50,000 a year, which, with the revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall, gave him &#x00A3;63,000. But he incurred debts to the amount of &#x00A3;650,000, and his allowance was raised to &#x00A3;113,000. As, however, &#x00A3;60,000 was allocated for the payment of his debts, with interest, he only, in fact, received &#x00A3;63,000. In past times it was always thrown back wards and forwards in the House of Commons whether the Prince of Wales should receive a large salary or not. The Opposition thought that if they could
<image src="S4V0094P0I0878"/>
<col>1513</col>
curry favour with the Prince of Wales they might get into power, and, accordingly, they were always in favour of giving him a large salary. The Government of the day, however, supported by the King, were always in favour of granting him a small amount. His present Majesty as Prince of Wales received &#x00A3;60,000, and Queen Alexandra as Princess of Wales received &#x00A3;10,000, or &#x00A3;70,000. At that time the Duchy of Cornwall produced &#x00A3;14,000, and it was estimated &#x00A3;84,000 per annum was amply sufficient for the Prince and Princess of Wales. At present the Duchy of Cornwall produced a little over &#x00A3;60,000, and there was a proposal that the Duchess of Cornwall should receive &#x00A3;10,000, in addition to which the Committee knew very well that when the Duke went abroad on visits such as that he was now paying to the Colonies he received large travelling allowances. Taking the Civil List at &#x00A3;540,000, &#x00A3;70,000 for the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall was more in proportion with it than the &#x00A3;130,000 which was practically proposed by the Government. It seemed to him that &#x00A3;70,000 was amply sufficient, and he did not see that more was required. If it were proved to him that more was required in order to keep up the state and dignity of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall he would be perfectly ready to vote it, but all the Committee had had up to the present were general statements. He was regarded as a kind of idol hater who went into temples protesting against diamonds and gold chains being hung on idols, but in this matter he thought that &#x00A3;70,000 was sufficient. Could the Chancellor of the Exchequer show it was not? A suggestion had been made by the hon. Member for Plymouth that as there were so many rich people in the country, some of whom were worth &#x00A3;2,000,000 of money, His Majesty should be given &#x00A3;3,000,000; but his plan would be much more simple. He would rather confiscate a great deal of the money of these millionaires than increase the amount of the Civil List, but that was a course which he could not hope would recommend itself to the Conservative party. However, he thought that with &#x00A3;70,000 a year a gentleman, though he happened to be the son of the Sovereign, ought to be
<col>1514</col>
able to rub along very comfortably, and he should, therefore, vote against the clause, but he should like the right hon. Gentleman to enlighten his ignorance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04214"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member has made a discursive speech, but as he asks me to enlighten his ignorance I would refer him to the appendix to the Report of the Committee, which is entirely at variance with the figures given by the hon. Member as to the allowance made by Parliament to his present Majesty when he was Prince of Wales. As far back as 1863 there was granted to his present Majesty &#x00A3;40,000 a year, at the same time His Majesty receiving &#x00A3;46,000 a year from the revenues of the Duchy of Cornwall. There was a further grant of &#x00A3;10,000 a year for her present Majesty, then Princess of Wales, and that altogether made up &#x00A3;96,000 a year just the same amount as the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York will, in all, receive. Therefore on what ground the hon. Member proposes that this clause should be rejected I cannot imagine. It has been thought necessary to make some reduction in the amount to be voted to the Duke of Cornwall and York, as the circumstances of the Heir Apparent when a Queen was on the Throne were somewhat different; but we could not ask Parliament to grant less than is now proposed in the clause&#x2014;&#x00A3;20,000 a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04215"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE</member><membercontribution> said he rose to support the Amendment, not because the amount proposed was too large but because the whole principle was wrong. The reason the House of Commons was called upon to vote the sum was that the Duke of Cornwall was the prospective heir to the Throne, and it was necessary to pay him a sort of retaining fee until such time as he was required to occupy that august position in order that he might learn his duties. Outside Royalty it was not the custom to do any such thing. Business men who desired to train their sons to any particular profession had to bear the cost of that training. Already the House had voted &#x00A3;20,000 for the personal expenses of the Duke of Cornwall and &#x00A3;40,000 for the ships of war which accompanied him,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0879"/>
<col>1515</col>
upon a journey he had undertaken to make himself better acquainted with the various parts of the Empire which he would one day be called upon to rule. He should vote for the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

sitting on the Liberal benches.

<col>1519</col>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04225"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> objected to the clause on the ground that it proposed to divide up the amount given to His Majesty into various classes. That was a course of which he disapproved, because, in his opinion, it showed a certain distrust of the King. If a large sum was to be voted for his household the King should be allowed to dispose of that sum. These classes were first adopted in the Civil List of George IV. In the reign of George III. Mr. Burke proposed that the Civil List should be divided into classes, and that the last class should be payments to Lords of the Treasury. The Lords of the Treasury strongly objected to this, because one of Mr. Burke's proposals was that if the amounts in the other classes were exhausted the Lords of the Treasury should not have anything for their class. One reason why he objected to this classification was that it allotted sums not only to particular classes, but to various items in each particular class, and although the sovereign was not obliged to expend money in a particular way, it was a strong recommendation to him to do so. There were a great many political officers in His Majesty's household, and it was a scandal and an outrage that, when a change of Government took place, money which was supposed to be provided for the maintenance of the State was distributed as bribes in the House of Lords. One Lord was made Lord Chamberlain and another Lord Steward. The Lord Chamberlain, the Lord Steward, and the Master of the Horse were of no use&#x2014;they were merely ornamental. One had only to look at the papers to see that there was a very large body of gentlemen permanently attached to the Court for these purposes. These gentlemen liked the positions, and, he presumed, they liked the money. These positions were simply given to them as rewards for past services to the party in power. He also objected to the ecclesiastical salaries. He took exception, in Committee, to the number of the King's chaplains, which was thirty-four, and he was supported in his action by His Majesty, or at any rate His Majesty was influenced by what he had said, which had no doubt been communicated to him, because he at once reduced the number of his chaplains by twenty-four.
<col>1520</col>
He would like to see that process with regard to chaplains continued. He would like the number to be still further reduced by ten. He would like to see the King rid himself of not only all the chaplains, but the political officers as well. A chaplain got only &#x00A3;40, but over &#x00A3;5,000 was charged for ecclesiastical salaries. That really amounted to an endowment of the Church of England. This was a personal matter, and he did not wish Parliament to interfere with the discretion of the King by laying down the heads of the expenditure, as it showed a want of confidence in him. Now that the money saved in any class went to the privy purse and not back to the Treasury, there was no purpose in dividing the Civil List into classes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04226"><member>MR. M'KENNA <memberconstituency>(Monmouthshire, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> also objected to the clause, but for somewhat different reasons. His view was that there was a great deal of expenditure which was useless, and served no proper purpose, and His Majesty also held that view, as would be seen from the fact that he had effected considerable retrenchments in various classes. But the result of all such retrenchments ought to go into the Treasury, and not go to swell the privy purse of the sovereign. The Committee settled an amount which they considered sufficient for the privy purse, and if the clause were allowed to stand it would mean that the effect would be that where any economy was effected in different classes the money saved would go into the privy purse, and not into the Treasury. He submitted that the proper course would be to hold an inquiry into the expenditure in the different classes, and having held that inquiry, to put the total amount of expenditure in each class at a figure which the Committee found to be appropriate, and that the result of any economy which happened to be effected should be paid back into the Treasury. With regard to the ecclesiastical offices, the King himself had now reduced the expenditure on ecclesiastical offices and salaries by &#x00A3;720 a year, and that saving ought not to go to the privy purse, but to the reduction of the Civil List.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1521</col>
ture in saying that economy in the ecclesiastical establishment has already been effected, though the King has had the matter under his consideration. The effect of omitting the clause would be to leave it in the power of the sovereign to decide to what purposes the whole of the Civil List should be applied. That is contrary to the practice of Parliament for many years. If the proposal is adopted Parliament will lose all control over the officers of the Court and the state of the Court. At present, although it is possible to effect economies in the different classes, yet transfers of expenditure from one class to another have to be approved by the Treasury. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to assent to a change which, to my mind, is almost unconstitutional.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04228"><member>SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT <memberconstituency>(Monmouth, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I very much agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that it is impossible to support the view that in voting this large sum of money the sovereign should be allowed to dispose of it as he thinks fit. The whole object of voting this money is to maintain the dignity of the Crown, and Parliament by the Civil List which it proposes indicates in general terms what it regards as belonging to the dignity of the Crown. The hon. Member for Northampton said that this is a new doctrine. So it is. But it was introduced because in the time of George III. the Civil List had been appropriated to purposes of which Parliament did not approve. Anyone familiar with the speeches of Burke on the Civil List would know that he condemned the course taken by George III. on the ground that the Civil List had been devoted, not to maintaining the dignity of the Crown, but to the promotion of the war in America. Therefore the new principle of indicating how the Civil List should be appropriated was adopted; and I must differ from the hon. Member for Northampton in preferring that constitutional doctrine.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04229"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> said the right hon. Gentleman had offered a piece of advice which might or might not be taken by the sovereign, and which in
<col>1522</col>
many instances, it was quite certain would not be taken. If clauses were put into the Bill by which it was provided that any money not paid to a particular class should remain in the Treasury, he could understand the value of such provisions. The Bill did not provide that the money must be spent in the particular classes, and that did away with the only reason for the division into classes. As the advantages of such an arrangement were not derived by the Treasury it was better that the whole amount should go to the sovereign in one sum. His reason for not voting in the Civil List Committee for the Amendment of the hon. Member for North Monmouth was that after voting against many large, sound, and practical reductions, the hon. Member proposed that after the whole matter had been settled the House should appoint a Committee composed of Members of both Houses of Parliament, and the head housemaid, or the head scullery wench, and other such persons, to consider whether a housemaid could be suppressed here, and a scullery wench there. Such a course would be like shutting the stable door after the steed was stolen. It was derogatory to Members of the House that they should be called upon to sit day after day with two or three housemaids and scullery wenches, to discuss these matters, and therefore he refused to vote for such silly little proposals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04230"><member>MR. M'KENNA</member><membercontribution>, having pointed out that the Amendment to which the hon. Member for Northampton alluded was an altogether different one from that to which he had referred in his previous remarks, drew the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the fact that &#x00A3;193,000 was put down for the expenses of His Majesty's Household, the members of which numbered something over 900. If by proper economies the Household could be reduced to 500, and the charge brought down to &#x00A3;100,000, the Treasury would have no power to prevent that reduction, and the other &#x00A3;93,000 would go automatically into the privy purse, instead of reverting to the Treasury, as the control of the Treasury applied only to transfers from one class to another, and not to reductions or economies in any particular class.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04231"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution> said the hon. Member had supposed an impossible case in suggesting that the Royal Household might be reduced from 900 to 500. Under the Amendment now proposed the sovereign would be enabled to abolish the Royal Household altogether, and, if he chose, distribute the money so saved among a number of members of the House of Lords&#x2014;to whom the hon.

<p id="S4V0094P0-04239"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution> said the hon. Member for Northampton agreed that it would not be fair to throw upon His Majesty the cost of the pensions of the servants of the late Queen who would now be retired, but for one reason or another he would still impose upon His Majesty the&#x00A3;12,000 pensions which existed before the death of her late Majesty. It was clear from the Report of the Civil List Committee that His Majesty contemplated considerable economies by the abolition of offices and the reduction of salaries, and to secure that object no doubt in many cases pensions would have to be paid. Accordingly, there would necessarily be a charge for pensions or gratuities quite irrespective of the amount in respect of servants of the late Queen, and if the Amendment of the hon. Member were carried it would be necessary to propose an increase of the Civil List by a corresponding amount. He therefore could not agree to the proposed Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04240"><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE</member><membercontribution> said the reason given for the House being asked to take over this liability was that His Majesty proposed to make a number of reductions. In that event there would be a saving of wages, so that not only was the House to be asked to take over the liability which appertained to the Civil List of the pensions of servants as they became due, but His Majesty was to be allowed to make money by dispensing with the services of different people. To argue that the present Civil List was no more than sufficient to meet the outlay of their Majesties without having to bear this &#x00A3;25,000 a year was carrying the generosity of the nation too far.

<p id="S4V0094P0-04243">Clause agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04244">Clause 8:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04245"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member> moved an Amendment to leave out certain words with the object of providing that Civil List Pensions, which at present amounted to &#x00A3;1,200 a year, to persons connected with literature and art, should not be charged on the Consolidated Fund, as was proposed, but should henceforth be put upon the Budget for the year. He saw no reason why any exception should be made in the case of these particular pensions. Under the present Bill these pensions
<col>1530</col>
were entirely eliminated from the Civil List. He thought he was right in saying that these pensions were granted by the First Lord of the Treasury, who was a literary man. He would say that in such matters he sat at the feet of the right hon. Gentleman, who was his Gamaliel. It must undoubtedly be a very great trouble and nuisance to the right hon. Gentleman to consider the immense number of applications made for this &#x00A3;1,200. The right hon. Gentleman would be greatly relieved if he could tell the zealous friends of some applicant that the granting of the pension would cause a bother in the House of Commons,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0887"/>
<col>1531</col>
It was not because he distrusted the right hon. Gentleman that he proposed this change. It was because it was part and parcel of the constitutional system of this country. Even the right hon. Gentleman made a mistake once. He would mention one curious case in this connection. An eminent poet, who was no doubt quite worthy of the position, got a salary on the Civil List as Poet Laureate, but he also got a pension. The hon. Member thought that was wrong. If he got a salary he ought not to be on the pension list. If the Poet Laureate was incapacitated from writing poetry or anything of that sort, and was retired, then he might get a pension, but not otherwise. Under these circumstances, he moved.</p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04247">Question proposed, "That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Clause."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04248"><sup>*</sup><member>SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: All these pensions are granted by the sovereign on the recommendation of the First Lord of the Treasury. What the hon. Member desires is that the pensions should not be charged on the Consolidated Fund, but on the Estimates for the year. The hon. Member seems to think that the matter will in some way be brought more particularly before the knowledge of Parliament if the pensions are charged on the Votes; but it is possible to challenge the advice given by the First Lord of the Treasury on the Vote for his salary, and there are also other means of raising the matter. Of course, every year a statement of the new pensions which have been granted is published, and from time to time a list of all the persons holding such pensions is laid before Parliament. These pensions could not be treated in the public accounts in the same way as those for ordinary civil servants, because they do not belong to any particular department. There is also another reason; they are of a different nature to ordinary Civil Service pensions because they are granted by the Sovereign, as a matter of grace and
<col>1532</col>
favour, on the advice of a Minister of the Crown. I must say I think it would detract from the grace of such pensions if they were subject to annual discussion in this House&#x2014;not merely those granted in the course of the year, but also those granted perhaps years ago. I hope the Committee will not change the practice which has been followed for many years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04249"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution> said the practice which had been adopted for the last sixty years was not the practice that was now to be adopted. During the last sixty years these pensions had been part of the Civil List itself, and as such were properly charged on the Consolidated Fund; they were now removed from the Civil List. They had ceased to be in their nature a Royal act of bounty, and they had become in reality a part of the money at the disposition of the Minister. The whole theory of the matter was that when money was at the disposal of a Minister he should give an account of it, and it should be put into the Votes of the House and subjected to annual review. That was not the case here. The whole of this money, amounting to &#x00A3;24,000 or &#x00A3;25,000 a year, would be at the disposal of the Minister, but it could never appear in any Vote of the House. The only thing capable of being; touched would be the salary of the Minister, which would be a most unsatisfactory substitute. If the First Lord of the Treasury agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this method was necessary, he would be loth to vote against it; at the same time, he did not think the money disbursed in this manner should be charged on the Consolidated Fund. Of course, there might be an answer to that argument, and if so-he hoped it would be forthcoming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04250"><member>THE FIRST LORD OF THE TREASURY (Mr. A. J. BALFOUR, <memberconstituency>Manchester, E.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: I think I can give my hon. friend reasons for thinking, as he suggests, that this is not really an amount which could be criticised. My hon. friend was under a misapprehension in thinking that there was any change in the system introduced by the Bill. My hon. friend is content with the system which prevailed during the life of the late Queen, but he appears to think there has been some change
<image src="S4V0094P0I0888"/>
<col>1533</col>
in the system which is now proposed, but I think I can show that that is not so. The old system was that the sovereign, on the advice of the Minister, gave certain pensions to persons who were considered to be deserving. The new system is exactly the same. The Minister now, as heretofore, has to consult his sovereign's pleasure as to whether such and such a pension should be given to such and such an individual, so that there is no difference whatever between the system which prevails under the present King and that which prevailed under the late Queen. The whole sum on which the Minister advises the sovereign is an amount of &#x00A3;1,200, and not &#x00A3;25,000. It is perfectly true, as the hon. Gentleman who moved the Amendment said, that the administration of this money is not a very agreeable task for the Minister responsible; on the contrary, it is an anxious, laborious, and difficult task; but I believe the expenditure to be useful on the whole, and I am sure its utility would be greatly impaired, if not wholly destroyed, if it were made subject to constant debates in Supply. After all, hon. Members know very well that there are discussions that take place in Supply in which the main interest of the gentlemen who take part in them is not the</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04251">acquisition of important truth for the public, or even for themselves, but an interesting interchange of dialectics between the Minister and the Minister's critics. That is all very well in purely public affairs, but when we come to the financial position of widows and orphans, and the comparative claims of different men of letters or science, the case is different. Then, I think, we should have a personal element, which this House would not be anxious to discuss, but which, if it cropped up in the ordinary course of debate, we should be obliged to discuss, which would be almost a misfortune, necessitating the alteration of the whole practice, which would not then be constitutional. It would be a great change to have these pensions granted, not by the sovereign on the advice of the Minister, but by the Minister in the ordinary course of his ministerial duties. That is not a change which I would recommend, and I would urge the House not to accept it. I would strongly urge the retention of the old system.</p>

It is introduced for the purpose of relieving Ministers from the unpleasant position in which they find themselves through continuing to sit and vote in this House after having taken an office of profit under the Crown. You might search the whole of the precedents of this House and not find a case of this kind. If it were desirable to make a change in the established practice of the House of Commons requiring Members of the House who accept an office of profit under the Crown to go to their constituents, and take their views upon their conduct, the alteration should be made under such circumstances as would relieve Ministers from all suggestion that it was made in their personal interest. For my part I do not agree with the view that has been expressed</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04260">from the Treasury Bench that the old practice had better be swept away altogether, and that Ministers should be allowed to accept an office of profit under the Crown without having to go to their constituencies afterwards. That might be a reasonable view to take for altering the practice of Parliament in the future, but that is quite a different thing to introducing a measure to relieve Ministers from a difficulty. It cannot be denied, to put it at the lowest, that there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether the Ministers could not be proceeded against, and penalties recovered from them, for sitting in this House. The Attorney General admitted that, and stated that one of the objects of this Bill was to remove the risk that existed that a court of law might take a different view to that which he expressed. If that means anything it means that this measure is introduced for the purpose of relieving Ministers from the risk of a decision of a court of law that they were sitting in this House when they had no right to do so. For these reasons I shall divide the House on the Third Reading.</p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04266">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Bill be now read a second time."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04267"><member>MR. CALDWELL <memberconstituency>(Lanarkshire, Mid)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that this Bill was by no means a large Bill on paper, but it contained very important changes in the law of England, particularly in regard to larceny. The Bill had arisen out of recent prosecutions of solicitors in England for misappropriations of money, and there was always a danger that when a change of the law was made on account of a specific grievance it might injuriously affect other cases which were not intended to fall under the change in the law. Last year there was a great rush to pass a Bill on this subject. The late Attorney General brought it in, and all that it proposed to do was to leave out the words "in writing" from a section in the existing Larceny Act. That would have affected the proof of the charge rather than the constitution of the crime. He had taken upon himself to move the rejection of the Bill, and the present Attorney General eventually withdrew it. In introducing the present Bill, the hon. and learned Gentleman condemned last year's Bill in the most violent terms, because, as he himself had shown, that Bill, instead of improving the law, made bad law worse. That showed the importance of not rushing Bills through the House at the end of a session, but of having them carefully considered. He did not object to a particular form of amending the law, and preventing crime in every possible way, but the amendment should be so carried out as to fulfil the purpose of the change in the law, without involving matters and crimes not intended to be dealt with. In England it was the essence of larceny or theft that there should be a wrongous taking of an article. There were other cases which were of the nature of theft, but these had been dealt with by the Legislature by statutory enactment, as, for instance, the case of clerks and servants who had been entrusted with the property of their masters, and who
<col>1542</col>
had appropriated it. Then there were the cases of bankers, solicitors, factors, and agents who were entrusted with property or money to be applied to a particular purpose, but who did not so apply it. That was made criminal by statutory enactment. Further, there was the case of carriers, and also the case of bailees, the appropriation of the goods entrusted to whom was not larceny by the common law of England, and it had to be made a civil offence by statutory enactment.<lb/>
The object of this Bill was apparently to make a new definition altogether of crime, and to sweep into the net everything that was of the nature of a criminal offence. In that respect there was a great deal to be said in favour of the Bill. It left to the judge and jury to determine, after hearing the whole case, how far there had been fraudulent conversion of the money. That altered a little the phraseology of the Larceny Act of 1861, and they might reasonably allow a sweeping in of everything in the nature of criminal offence. He himself did not see any particular reason for Sub-section <i>b</i> of Clause 1. for it dealt with a different category of cases from those dealt with under Sections 75 and 76 of the. Larceny Act of 1861. He would like to know the effect of the Bill on cases where money had been found, and on that other class of cases to which he had already referred, namely, clerks and servants. He thought, from the definition given in the first clause, that it would apply to clerks and servants who were now dealt with under the existing Larceny Act. They would then have this anomaly, that there would be two procedures for the same offence. The same thing applied to bailees. Further, would the Bill sweep away existing enactments against carriers and bring them all under this Bill? He suggested that it would have been better to have made all these cases fall under the class of theft and made them part of the common law. By doing so they would get rid of a great many technicalities in procedure. When they made new statutory crimes the door was open to any amount of interpretation by the judges.<lb/>
He thought the Attorney General would do well to re-consider the matter
<image src="S4V0094P0I0893"/>
<col>1543</col>
between now and the Committee stage as to whether it would not be advisable to follow the recommendation of the Legal Commission of 1878. He did not see why under Sub-section 2 of Clause 1 any exception should be made in regard to trustees or mortgagees. It should be left to the judge and jury to say whether there had been fraudulent misapplication of the money by the trustee or mortgagee, and if there had been fraudulent misapplication why should they be protected? Then why was the proviso in the earlier Act in regard to lien excluded from the present measure? and why also was the clause in the Commissioners' Report of 1878, to the effect that where the subject-matter resolved itself into a matter of accounting the Act was not to apply&#x2014;why was that proviso not introduced into the present Bill, when they went out of their way to introduce the proviso as regards trustees and mortgagees? At the same time, he did not propose to oppose the Second Reading. He quite recognised that a change in the law was necessary, and that there were anomalies in England that should be removed. At present the criminal law only applied to certain specified persons, and he quite approved of its being extended to, for instance, auctioneers who sold property and did not account for the money. In all such cases the principle was right, but he thought that the Attorney General was hardly carrying out the object he had in view by setting up new statutory crimes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04268"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. WARR <memberconstituency>(Liverpool, E. Toxteth)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the Bill was a vast improvement on the Bill of last session. It was simple, comprehensive, and intelligible. He associated himself with what the hon. Gentleman opposite had said with regard to Sub-section 2. No doubt what he had said would receive consideration from the Attorney General. There was a section in the Larceny Act dealing with misappropriation by trustees, but under that section it was necessary first to get the fiat of the Attorney General, and secondly the certificate of a judge of a civil court, in case the offence had come to light in the course of civil proceedings. There was no objection to these safeguards as regarded frauds under wills and settle-
<col>1544</col>
ments, but he was not so sure that there would not be a good deal of objection to them in dealing with frauds by trustees arising out of commercial transactions. He would put a case to the Attorney General. The course of business between banker and customer in business centres with which he was acquainted, though it might not apply to London, was that after an advance had been made by the banker upon the security of produce pledged with him by the customer, it was entrusted by the banker to an agent whether the customer himself or someone else, for sale on the bank's account upon the written terms that the proceeds were to be paid to the banker as and when received. The agent was thus constituted a trustee, and the provisions of the Bill applicable would apply to such a transaction. If there was misappropriation of proceeds the banker could take no criminal proceedings without the fiat of the Attorney General, and in certain cases without the consent of the judge who tried the civil action. Before these consents had been obtained the customer might have left the country. That was an illustration of the kind of case which indicated that the Bill might by amendments be perhaps made more useful. He hoped the matter would be very carefully considered, but he himself was inclined at present to think that the sub-section might well be omitted altogether.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04269"><member>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir ROBERT FINLAY, <memberconstituency>Inverness Burghs</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said that everyone would agree with what had been said by the hon. Member for Mid Lanark, that the subject was one of very great importance. The Report of the Commission which the hon. Gentleman quoted proposed to remodel the law of theft, but he would point out to the hon. Gentleman that that would involve a very extensive and difficult enterprise. Without undertaking an enterprise so ambitious, they were content to remove the blots upon that portion of the law which dealt with the offence of misappropriation by persons entrusted with property by others. Sections 75 and 76 of the Act of 1861 were open to very serious objections. No reason could be given for the necessity for directions in writing, particularly in the case of misappropriation by solicitors, with whom
<image src="S4V0094P0I0894"/>
<col>1545</col>
it often rested to say whether directions should be given in writing or not. That provision was one which often prevented justice being done. Again, no good reason could be given for the state of the law which declared that only agents by profession should be amenable to the provisions of the sections. The hon. Member for Mid Lanark referred to the fact that the Bill contained a proviso that any person receiving property for another might be guilty of a misdemeanour if he fraudulently misapplied that property. He quite agreed that the keynote of the whole Bill was to be found in the word "fraudulent." But he would further point out that the mere fact that property belonged to another person would not bring it within the words, "received any property for or on account of any other person." The effect of the Bill would be to bring agents to receive as well as agents to pay within the scope of the criminal law if guilty of fraud in respect of property they had received. The hon. Member pointed out that a question might arise if a defendant had been guilty of conduct which rendered him liable to prosecution under other provisions of the criminal law. But that was dealt with in the Interpretation Act of 1899, Section 33 providing that, where an act constituted an offence under one or more Acts or under common law, the offender should be liable to be prosecuted under either or all of the Acts or at common law so long as he was not punished twice for the same offence. Various other criticisms were made by the hon. Gentleman, the importance of which he recognised, and which no doubt would form the subject of consideration in Committee. He was much struck with what the hon. Gentleman had said as to the omission of the proviso with regard to the disposal of property under any lien or charge. He would point out to the hon. Gentleman that that proviso was absolutely unnecessary. It was contained in Section 75 of the Larceny Act of 1861, but it was not wanted there, and still less would it be wanted in the present Bill, under which no man would be liable unless he acted fraudulently. The hon. Gentleman and also his hon. friend referred to the provision exempting trustees and mortgagees from the operation of the Bill. The House ought to know that that provision was taken from
<col>1546</col>
the analogous section of the Act of 1861. With regard to mortgagees it was originally inserted on the ground that as the mortgagee was the owner of the property it would be hard, if a dispute arose between him and the mortgagor, that the latter should be at liberty to take criminal proceedings. Certainly more mature consideration would be required before they undertook to enlarge the criminal law further in that direction, but no doubt the clause would receive consideration in Committee. With regard to the cases to which his hon. friend more particularly referred, any trustee under an instrument in writing who fraudulently misapplied property was liable to prosecution under the law as it stood. His hon. friend said that certain conditions had to be complied with by the prosecutor, but they were not at all onerous. If civil proceedings were entered on, it was very proper that the certificate of the judge should be obtained that the case was one suitable for criminal prosecution, and if it were suitable there would be no difficulty about obtaining a certificate. The other condition was that the fiat of the Attorney General should be obtained for a prosecution. He did not think that any difficulty or delay would be occasioned by that condition, while the necessity of obtaining the fiat of the law officers was some security against improper claims being put forward. No doubt the whole subject deserved and would receive full consideration in Committee. It should always be remembered that there was danger of the criminal law being applied, or rather misapplied, for the purpose of enforcing a civil liability, and care should be taken that in preventing the escape of rogues, honest men were not laid open to vexatious charges. He desired to express his appreciation of the spirit in which the Bill had been received, and he could assure hon. Members that every suggestion in Committee would receive the fullest consideration.</membercontribution></p>

the third section of the Larceny Act of 1861, with which the Bill was intended to be read.

<title>BERWICKSHIRE COUNTY TOWN BILL<lb/> [Lords].</title>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04278" align="center">[SECOND READING.]</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04279">Order for Second Reading read.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04280"><member>THE LORD ADVOCATE (Mr. A. GRAHAM MURRAY, <memberconstituency>Buteshire</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said that the Bill was an entirely non-controversial measure introduced by the Government at the request of the county authorities in Berwickshire, who unanimously desired that the seat of county government should be changed from Greenlaw to Duns. The present arrangement was found exceedingly inconvenient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04281">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Bill be now read a second time."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04282"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> asked, if the Bill were non-controversial, why the hon. Member
<col>1548</col>
for Berwickshire was not present to support it. It was a very important measure, and he had received communications from persons in the county begging him to oppose it. The only reason why he was approached on the matter was that on one occasion he addressed a meeting at Greenlaw in support of the hon. Member for Berwickshire, and some of the hon. Member's constituents had written him stating that the people of Greenlaw were strongly opposed to the Bill. The Lord Advocate stated that the Bill had the support of the county authorities. Did they include the people of Greenlaw?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04283"><member>MR. A. GRAHAM MURRAY</member><membercontribution> said he was not aware that the people of Green-law were a county authority. He used the word in the ordinary sense.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04284"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he thought it was rather a large order to ask the House of Commons to pass a Bill of this kind without some clearer proof of the desire of the county than the bald statement of the Lord Advocate. For all they knew the change might have only been carried by a narrow majority of the county council. In the absence of a more convincing statement he should certainly divide the House against the Bill. Greenlaw had been the county town of Berwickshire since 1696, and the House ought to be given a more reasonable explanation before it was asked to disturb an arrangement which had existed for two centuries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04285"><member>MR. FLYNN <memberconstituency>(Cork, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it was extraordinary that such a Bill should have been brought forward as a Government measure at a comparatively early hour when much more important work might be transacted. He hoped that the old traditions connected with one of the most important and interesting parts of the Border would not be broken down without some more reasonable and valid explanation. He knew the country well, and he could not conceive why Duns should be selected as the county town rather than Greenlaw. The Lord Advocate said that certain county authorities had expressed a desire for the change, but the House had not heard the opinion of other local bodies regarding it. It was a significant fact that the hon. Member for
<image src="S4V0094P0I0896"/>
<col>1549</col>
Berwickshire was not present. If the hon. Gentleman had been strongly in support of the measure he would have been present to have given his representative blessing to it. No adequate reason had been given why an arrangement which had existed for over two centuries should now be changed. They had only had a few words from an ill-informed Lord Advocate, who thought, forsooth, that because a certain Bill was starred, therefore it ought to be accepted by the House without any information regarding it being given. It did not matter to him a twopenny ticket whether Duns or Greenlaw was to be the county town. He was impartial, but the question was what did the people of the district concerned think of the change? The hon. Member for the division was probably embarrassed between new claims and existing claims, and had therefore left the House. He did not blame the hon. Member, and he could quite understand other hon. Members being in equally embarrassing positions if similar Bills affecting their constituencies were brought forward. Was it reasonable to ask the House of Commons, which was already up to its neck in business, to make such a change as was proposed by the Bill without any explanation? They had no idea of the relative importance of Greenlaw and Duns, and he did not think that the House of Commons would be justified in destroying the status of an old commerical town without more adequate reasons. He hoped, therefore, that the House would resist the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04286"><sup>*</sup><member>CAPTAIN BALFOUR <memberconstituency>(Middlesex, Hornsey)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he acknowledged that the hon. Member for North Cork had a considerable knowledge of Berwickshire, as the hon. Member was through it when he was contesting the county against the present Member. As a member of the Berwickshire County Council he desired to put before the House the Berwickshire side of the question, and he was sure that hon. Gentlemen opposite would agree with the principle of Home Rule for Berwickshire. It was true that Greenlaw had a record of 200 years, but Duns went back further still, for it was the old county town, before Greenlaw by the influence of the Earls of Marchmont was made the county town in
<col>1550</col>
1696. They would be very well content to have Greenlaw still for their county town, were it not for the fact that Duns was now the natural centre and the most important town in the county. The only people likely to object to Duns would be the legal element, who had still to meet at Greenlaw under the existing Act. But owing to the fact that the bulk of the members of the legal profession now lived in Duns, they were equally unanimous with the county council in desiring that the business should be conducted in future at Duns instead of Greenlaw. He hoped the House would accept this statement from one who, although he did not represent Berwickshire, lived in the county and knew something about the district. He had talked the matter over with the hon. Member for Berwickshire; they were in absolute agreement upon this point, and he presumed it was only through some unfortunate accident that the hon. Member was not present to support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04287"><member>MR. WEIR <memberconstituency>(Ross and Cromarty)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> was extremely disappointed that the Lord Advocate had not made the House better acquainted with the object of the Bill. It was also very extraordinary that at a time when there was so much urgent business of a far more important character, to the consideration of which the House might devote its time, a miserable measure of this kind should be brought forward. He was inclined to think this was a landlord's Bill, but sufficient information had not been given to enable Members to judge whether or not they should vote for the Second Reading. It was surprising that the hon. Member for Berwickshire was not present either to support the Bill or to defend his county. Certainly if it had been a Bill affecting Ross-shire he (the speaker) would have been in his place to give the House all the information in his possession.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04288"><member>MR. JAMES O'CONNOR <memberconstituency>(Wicklow, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> inferred that this Bill was the outcome of a contest between the Greenlaws and the Dunses, and having listened to the speeches which had been delivered he had decided to vote for the Greenlaws against the Dunses.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04299">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That this House doth agree with the Committee in the said resolution."</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04300"><member>MR. O'MARA <memberconstituency>(Kilkenny, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it was frequently urged that the expenditure of money in Ireland compensated that country for the large revenue derived from her, but on looking through the Estimates that appeared not to be the case. The amount collected for Excise was about the same in Ireland as in Scotland, but the expenses of collection were about twice as much in Scotland as in Ireland. The salaries of assistant supervisors and first-class officers amounted to &#x00A3;105,000 in Scotland, but to only &#x00A3;46,000 in Ireland. The total cost of collecting the Excise in Scotland was &#x00A3;184,812, as against &#x00A3;93,868 in Ireland, while the numbers of officials employed in the two countries were 882 and 433 respectively. Moreover, in Scotland, the average amount of the salaries paid was much higher than in Ireland. If the officials in the latter country were as efficient as those in Scotland, why was not their pay the same? Another point to which he desired to direct attention was the amount of the rewards paid to the Royal Irish Constabulary for detecting persons engaged in illicit distillation in Ireland. While 1,800 illicit stills were discovered in Ireland, only two were discovered in Scotland. When on a previous occasion the hon. Member for East Mayo asked the amount of these rewards he was told that it was only a few pounds, but the sum taken in the Estimates was &#x00A3;3,000. That was a very great encouragement for the discovery of illicit stills, and he suggested that a large proportion of the discoveries in Ireland were manufactured for the sake of the reward.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04301"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: I think the figures quoted by the hon. Member for South Kilkenny require some explanation. On
<col>1556</col>
Friday night last I pointed out that in Scotland there were 129 distilleries at work as compared with 30 or 35 in Ireland, and yet in the course of last year only five illicit stills were discovered in Scotland as against 1,865 in Ireland. These figures are very difficult to understand. Living in Ireland as I do, and knowing that seizures for illicit distilling are very rare, I was astounded at these figures, and asked the Financial Secretary the amount of the rewards paid to the members of the Royal Irish Constabulary for effecting these seizures. He told me that it was something very trifling, and that the sums ranged from 5s. to &#x00A3;1 or &#x00A3;2, while for very large seizures the amount was higher.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04302"><member>THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, <memberconstituency>Worcestershire, E.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: May I interrupt the hon. Gentleman in order to correct a misapprehension? In the amount that I gave I spoke not of the whole sum, but of the rewards given in individual cases. I spoke of them as ranging from 5s. to some pounds in important cases. Since then I have made inquiries, and I find that the normal reward in Ireland is &#x00A3;2 in each case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04303"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: I suppose that is the minimum. The amount in the Estimates is &#x00A3;3,000 for this year, which is an increase of &#x00A3;500 over last year. I do submit that some explanation and inquiry is called for in regard to the number of seizures for illicit distillation in Ireland. It is ludicrous to tell this House that there are only five cases of illicit distillation in Scotland as against 800 cases in Ireland. There must be some reason to account for this extraordinary condition of things. It is absurd to tell us at the opening of the twentieth century that the seizures for illicit distillation in Ireland are increasing, when we have in that country the most idle and the most unoccupied police in the world. The police of Ireland are kicking their heels all day with nothing to do, except when they are summoning people for illicit distillation. It is positively ludicrous to state that in Ireland, where the police are three or four times more numerous than in Scotland, you are unable to put an end to this illicit distillation, which is said to be growing to an alarming
<image src="S4V0094P0I0900"/>
<col>1557</col>
extent. I believe that the figure given is a bogus one in regard to seizures for illicit distillation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04304"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: The question raised by the hon. Member for East Mayo, which was also raised the other night, is one which requires serious consideration. Having had my attention drawn to the matter I at once communicated with the Board of Inland Revenue on the subject, and I agree with the hon. Gentleman who spoke last that the present condition of affairs is serious, and that the explanation I have to offer is not a sufficient one. I propose to go into the matter with the Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, and to consider in greater detail what the nature of the seizures has been, and whether the system of rewards which has been in force without change for several years is a good one&#x2014;and I am inclined to think that it is not. At any rate, before the Estimates for next year are presented I will do my best, in conjunction with the Board of Inland Revenue, to inquire fully into this matter, and I hope that I shall be able to make a satisfactory statement. As I only had my attention drawn to this matter on Friday last, I am not prepared to make a full statement at the present moment, but I admit that the facts require further explanation. I hope the House will be satisfied with this statement, and allow me the necessary time to make inquiries. With regard to the other questions raised, they refer to the cost of the staff in Ireland and Scotland respectively, and I am afraid that it is not possible for me to enter into a detailed explanation of the duties of every officer mentioned, or the reason why more are employed in one place than the other. The staff is selected with a view to the duties that have to be performed, and we take care that we do not have more staff than there is work for, and the extra staff employed in Scotland is due to extra work.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04305"><member>MR. CREAN <memberconstituency>(Cork, S. E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> protested against the system established in Ireland of creating crime where no crime exists. He knew that this was the case, because he had conversed with some of the constables at the places where bogus seizures
<col>1558</col>
had been made. Those who were making these bogus seizures were not only swindling the Treasury but they were blackening the character of the country, where they were supposed to carry out the law impartially. The truth was that they were not honest and proper seizures at all, for those who concealed things could easily find them. He thought it would be well if the Secretary to the Treasury extended his inquiry so as to find out whether the rewards were genuine or not. He felt sure that many of the rewards were bogus ones, and he did not think they would be justified in voting this sum that night, because it was practically a premium on dishonesty. He thought the Secretary to the Treasury had made his promised inquiry in order to get the Vote through. This money was squandered in order to create crime where crime did not exist before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04306">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04307">Second resolution:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04308"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. HENNIKER HEATON <memberconstituency>(Canterbury)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I again desire to enter my protest against the absence of the Postmaster General in this House, and against the absence of any direct representative of the Post Office in the House of Commons. No doubt my hon. friend who represents the Post Office in this House has shown great intelligence and courtesy, but we are face to face with this fact, that the hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury had never been in the Post Office in his life before he took up his present position. Therefore he knows nothing about the Post Office, and upon three occasions last week he had to ask for notice of questions which a direct representative of the Department would have been able to answer at once. The great importance of the Post Office is shown by the fact that the Department employs 175,000 persons, and its revenue exceeds &#x00A3;17,000,000. There are hundreds of cases of complaints which it is necessary to bring before the attention of the Postmaster General, but under the present system it is impossible to reach him except by means of a long correspondence. As I have told the Committee before, during the past five years
<image src="S4V0094P0I0901"/>
<col>1559</col>
only three questions have been addressed to the Postmaster General in the House of Lords, while some thousands of questions affecting that Department have been asked in the House of Commons. I wonder what would be the position of affairs if we had no representative of the War Office or the Admiralty in this House, and I maintain that it is of equal importance that some direct representative of the Post Office should represent that great Department in this House. There is no Member of the House of Commons who does not realise the importance of having a representative in the House of Commons directly connected with the Post Office. It is perfectly well known that if this question is allowed to be considered entirely apart from party politics a resolution for the direct representation of the Post Office in this House would be carried unanimously. This is the state of affairs which exists under the present system. My hon. friend who at present represents the Treasury possesses undoubted ability, but he is quite unable to answer any ordinary point without referring to the Post Office, and that is a state of things which we ought not to tolerate in this House, considering the enormous importance of the Post Office. I wish to move that the salary of the Postmaster General or the Vote be reduced by a sum of &#x00A3;100 in order to test this question.<lb/>
I shall now proceed to point out two or three grievances in regard to the Post Office which will, I think, illustrate the utter inability of the Postmaster General to make reforms even of the smallest description, and I will endeavour to show how necessary it is that the House of Commons should assert its authority in matters of this kind. I have so often brought these questions before the House that I am almost ashamed to repeat them. For every one of the receipts given for a 6d. telegram, which does not cost a farthing, the Post Office charge 2d. It is almost incredible that any Government department would dare to make a charge of this kind. No successful merchant or business man would do so. The late Postmaster General made an appeal to the Treasury to abolish this charge, but that appeal was made in
<col>1560</col>
vain. I think that an annoying and irritating charge of this character should be abolished at once, for it would only cost the Treasury about &#x00A3;120 a year. My next point is in regard to the question of postal orders. It is not generally known that the profit on lost postal orders amounts to considerably over &#x00A3;10,000 a year&#x2014;I think it amounts to &#x00A3;15,000, but they credit the Post Office with &#x00A3;10,000 a year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04309"><member>MR. WEIR</member><membercontribution>: It is &#x00A3;15,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04310"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. HENNIKER HEATON</member><membercontribution>: That being the case, you would imagine that a great Department like the Post Office would deal liberally with the public in regard to postal orders. This, however, is not the case, and there is a rule to the effect that any postal order not presented within three months is subject to fines. The result is that in a very short time the fines amount to so much that the postal orders are not worth presenting. A gentleman from a bank in Ireland sent me a postal order for 1s. which had been mislaid since the year 1890. He had presented it in Dublin, but the Post Office officials told him that if they cashed it he would have to pay them 1s. 4d. in fines. In regard to having a greater variety of amounts in the value of postal orders, I know it is a rather complicated subject, but I do complain of the inability of the Postmaster General to issue a sufficient number of varieties of amounts, because this causes great annoyance to the public. The public often pay more for postal orders for 19s. 6d. than for postal orders for &#x00A3;1. I particularly regret the inability of the Postmaster General to issue a postal order for a guinea. With regard to the extension of postal orders, it is remarkable that, although you can get them at Gibraltar and Hong Kong, the Post Office will not extend postal orders to Australia and other colonies, notwithstanding the fact that frequent petitions have been presented to the Postmaster General upon this subject. My chief complaint is that the charges are considerably in excess of the charges in any other country in the world. If I send 5s. to France I have to pay 6d. for the money order, but a Frenchman can send 5s. to London for 1d. In each
<image src="S4V0094P0I0902"/>
<col>1561</col>
case we send the money orders through the respective post offices of France and England. This ought not to be tolerated. Frequent complaints have been made, and the Postmaster General has announced his inability to deal with the matter. There are scores of cases which show that the British Post Office is absolutely incapable of dealing with these matters, and the annoyance to the people is very great indeed.<lb/>
There is another important matter in this connection which will appeal to hon. Members of this House. It is a fact that you cannot send a few pence to this country from any country in the world to purchase a periodical or a newspaper without the recipient being subject to a fine. A man wrote to me from Africa the other day stating that he would like to have sent 6d. as a contribution to some charitable object, and he complained that to send that 6d. from his colony to this country would cost him 9d. for the order. There are hundreds of cases daily arising where people want to send to this country for books or catalogues, and it is impossible to send a few pence for this purpose. The remedy for this is a very simple one. There should be one room at the Post Office, and at the principal post offices in this country, where stamps of the Empire and of foreign countries could be exchanged for a small commission. An arrangement of this kind would be a very great convenience to the people. I do not wish to detain the House upon this question, and it would take me till to-morrow morning to describe the whole of the details. I wish, however, to point out that in regard to the great city of London the time has arrived for an alteration of the whole office in various directions. I think the time has arrived when we should have three classes of postmen&#x2014;the first-class, the second-class, and the third-class. The first-class postmen should be sent out on the first delivery with letters, the second-class postmen with newspapers, and the third-class postmen with parcels. The effect of this arrangement would be that every house within an area of seven miles would have the letters delivered earlier every morning, as they were at present in all the great cities of the kingdom. What do we see now
<col>1562</col>
early in the morning? About half-past eight we often see the postman heavily weighted with a huge bag of newspapers and letters and parcels all mixed up together. The whole thing is absurd. If you have first-class postmen to go out first with the letters, quickly followed by the second-class postmen with the newspapers, and the third-class with the parcels, then you would have an earlier and a more intelligent delivery by the first-class postmen, and I think a reform of this kind would work very well indeed.<lb/>
I shall not to-night describe in detail the present condition of affairs and the waste of expenditure which goes on in this great Government department. I think it is, however, a great disgrace to this country that we have not at the present time in connection with the Post Office a printing department. In most countries the Government office print all their own stamps and postcards and other things, and I have been informed on good authority that a saving of from &#x00A3;25,000 to &#x00A3;30,000 a year could be effected if the Government had a printing office of their own. The arrangements in regard to the delivery of postcards and parcels require looking into, and one of the ablest men in the Post Office has told me that a saving of &#x00A3;280,000 a year could be effected by a rearrangement of the Post Office administration in London alone. I will not go further into details upon this occasion, and I will content myself by merely entering a protest, because it would be absurd to expect any changes or improvement while the present administration is continued. In order to test the question of the desirability of having a direct representative of the Post Office in this House, I beg to move this reduction. If the Government will not make this a party question I feel sure that the result will be that it will be found that the whole House of Commons is in favour of a change of this kind.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1563</col>
ing exposition of public grievances against the Post Office contained in the speech of the hon. Member for Canterbury. Without respect to party, I think we are all thankful to the hon. Member who has just sat down for his effort in the past in connection with reforms in the postal department. I rose for the purpose of calling attention to another aspect of Post Office administration. The House of Commons must not forget that much of the success of the Post Office is due to the efficiency of the men employed in the various departments, to whose complaints the First Lord of the Treasury has turned a deaf ear. Last week, when this Vote was under discussion, the Leader of the House stated that there was no real grievance existing amongst the Post Office employees, and in the course of the debate it was stated that the outcome of the Tweedmouth Committee, which recently sat to determine into those grievances, had been practically to make the conditions of employment under the Post Office much more favourable to the employees. I will not attempt to-night to enter at any length into the many details of the numerous grievances which Post Office servants complain of. There is, however, one aspect of their demands which is entitled to the serious consideration of the House of Commons. I endorse the suggestion which my hon. friend has made as to the need for a permanent Committee to deal not only with the conditions of employment in the Post Office, but also with other matters affecting the administration of the Post Office. The employees of the Post Office request from the House of Commons the appointment of a special Committee to investigate their grievances, and to formulate such remedies as the circumstances demand. May I point out that the Tweedmouth Committee was a Departmental Committee, and the servants were not represented on it. From a Departmental Committee it is almost impossible to secure a decision of any breadth or width. It is like allowing a jury of malefactors to try their own case, and under such circumstances we can anticipate what the finding will be.<lb/>
Let me give one illustration of the sort of minor grievances under which Post Office servants are still labouring. Take, for example, the case of the rural postmen.
<col>1564</col>
They were recommended by Lord Tweedmouth's Committee to be paid a scale of wages whereby they were able to advance to 18s. and 20s. a week and higher, but of late the Post Office has been departing, from that recommendation, and instead of appointing rural postmen under the scale it has been appointing them at fixed wages of 16s. a week. That is to say, instead of a man being encouraged to perform his duty adequately, and with the prospect of an early increment in his wages, he has no such outlook, and, instead of the wage being as the Tweedmouth Committee recommended, under the new method of treating the rural postmen the maximum is 16s. a week. A matter of small detail, but still an irritating one, is the way in which those men are paid for Sunday work and Christmas and other holidays. Formerly they were paid so much per hour for the time they were employed, in delivering letters on these particular days, but now they are paid not so much per hour, but so much per mile covered in the delivery. Well, on the face of it, these arrangements are stupid. In one mile there might be fifty or sixty houses, and in another there may be 500 or 600 houses. It is obviously impossible to cover the ground in the same time where the houses are numerous, and it is desirable, looking to the circumstances under which the rural postmen work, that the old system of payment by time instead of by mileage should be resorted to. I understand that a case was submitted to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury some time ago, and that it was proved to him clearly how this new system worked out. I have to ask to-night whether he is in a position to state what the result of his consideration of the case has been, and whether the rural postmen in this respect may anticipate any change.<lb/>
These are a few illustrations of some of the minor grievances which irritate a body of useful and intelligent employees, and I would desire to point out, with all respect to the House, that, whilst the servants of the Post Office have no desire to inconvenience the community by any cessation or stoppage of work on their part, still if the House and the Government persist in turning a deaf ear to their claim for an impartial
<image src="S4V0094P0I0904"/>
<col>1565</col>
investigation of their grievances these men will not be to blame if in the end their patience and forbearance give way and the whole of our postal system is disorganised by some big labour dispute. I therefore hope that the Government, through the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, will not to-night again take up the <i>non possumus</i> attitude adopted by the First Lord of the Treasury of threatening these Post Office servants with disfranchisement because they are doing what every Member of this House is doing&#x2014;seeking to protect his own interest in a constitutional fashion. It is an insult to these men, and I should like to see the Government that would attempt to disfranchise the civil servants of the country. This House stands in relation to these civil servants just as the board of directors of a private company do to the men they employ. These men have a right to come to us at election times or other times and state their grievances, and to ask us to assist them in securing redress. To threaten them with disfranchisement for constitutional action of that kind, as was done on Friday evening, was unworthy of the First Lord of the Treasury. These, briefly, are some of the points upon which the postmen feel keenly, and upon which they demand inquiry. I trust that to-night we shall have some encouragement given to these men to go on performing their duty by having the prospect held out to them of getting their legitimate grievances inquired into in the proper way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04314"><member>MR. BROADHURST <memberconstituency>(Liecester)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: At present, as for some years past, we have no means of communication whatever with the Post Office except by a Treasury messenger. I have no cause of complaint with the manner in which the previous and the present Secretary of the Treasury have done their work, but the House of Commons has a right to direct access to the Department, which is one of the most important, affecting as it does the welfare of the poorer classes of the community. There are with regard to the Post Office undoubted grievances. We ought to have a direct, sure, and certain means of communication between this House and the heads of this great Department.
<col>1566</col>
The beginning and almost the end of our difficulty in this matter is that we have no direct representative of the Department in this House. I sincerely hope that the hon. Member will divide on this question, and that the Secretary to the Treasury will make representations to the Government in connection with this matter. I know that the Post Office grievances are great, and one might almost say they are acute. We shall never have satisfaction in this matter until we have the head of the Post Office sitting in this House. I sincerely trust that immediate steps will be taken, so that we shall have the representative element which is desired. It is an absurd idea to have the Postmaster General in the House of Lords. There is no trade, no commerce, no anything represented there, except the brewing interest, which is not a large commercial interest. We are representing the industries of the country in this House, and yet we are only treated with a messenger to take occasional communications from this House to the Post Office, however well that work is done. It is no reflection on those who have been the go-betweens up to now, but it is not respectful to the country, and certainly not respectful to the House of Commons. I sincerely trust that the hon. Member for Canterbury, who has done such marvellous service to the country in postal reform, will press the question to a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04315"><member>MR. JOHN DEWAR <memberconstituency>(Invernessshire)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that two years ago the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Preston, who was Financial Secretary to the Treasury then, promised that there would be an improved delivery of letters all over the country, including the remote parts of Scotland and Ireland. On that occasion an Amendment was withdrawn when the promise was made. The Postmaster General had since then written that a bi-weekly service could not be granted on account of the expense. He thought that no part of the country should have to submit to a weekly or a fortnightly delivery of letters. In certain rural districts they did not ask a daily delivery, but a better service should be provided than at present.</membercontribution></p>

<col>1567</col>
service provided at Baltimore, an important fishing station in the south of Ireland. Letters from Cork were detained at Skibbereen for a day, although the trains proceeded to Baltimore. He wished to know whether this matter was going to be remedied. He also asked whether the postal service could not be improved at other important fishing stations. It had been proved by Royal Commission that Ireland was cheated of two and a quarter millions a year; and surely when they asked for an expenditure of only &#x00A3;6 or &#x00A3;7 a year it ought not to be grudged. He wished to know from the hon. Member whether he was going to remedy this grievance, and what they were going to expect from the Government in the way of killing Home Rule by kindness.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04317"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: When this Vote was before the Committee the chief discussion occurred on the question whether the hon. Gentleman in charge of Post Office matters would see his way to the appointment of a Committee to inquire into the grievances of the Post Office employees. The hon. Member refused to grant that Committee; but I do not think that it will be possible to continue that refusal if the Postmaster General does not give a more sympathetic consideration to definite cases of abuses or grievances brought before him. I myself have been in correspondence with the Postmaster General for eight months on a particular subject, but have been unable to get any satisfaction from him. It is not my wish to trouble the House with petty details, for I consider that the House is the worst tribunal in the world to deal with these sort of questions. They could much better be dealt with by a Special Commission, or some other authority which could deal gently and kindly with the men and their grievances. But after four hours discussion there was a blank refusal of such a Special Commission or authority. The grievance to which I wish to allude lies in a very small compass. Everyone in the House desires to see the Sunday labour of the Post Office servants restricted as far as possible. In carrying out this very desirable reform a few old servants in the Post Office in London&#x2014;not more than twenty in all&#x2014;who have been carrying on Sunday duty for thirty
<col>1568</col>
to thirty-five years, have been deprived of that Sunday duty, and their pay has consequently been reduced from &#x00A3;15 to &#x00A3;20 a year. The men get the Sunday rest, and they do not object to the reduction of their pay; but they are entering on the last three years on the pay on which the amount of their pensions will be calculated under the ordinary rule, and the consequence will be that their pensions will be materially reduced. Now, they have asked the Department to consider their case as special. Some of them have worked for thirty-five years, and they ask that their pensions, when due, shall not be calculated on the three years in which the pay has been compulsorily reduced, but on the three years preceding. Does that not seem reasonable? They may have to lose &#x00A3;13 a year in pensions because the Post Office have made this change. This is a business matter, and it, could be quite easily dealt with; but the Department insists on putting a very harsh interpretation on some red-tape rule, and leaves these men under the rankling feeling that they are being hardly dealt with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04318"><member>COLONEL NOLAN <memberconstituency>(Galway, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the wise policy of the First Lord of the Treasury in instituting light railways to the West Coast had called for a great increase in postal facilities, and especially for a Sunday delivery at the fishing towns. It was true that in some places the postal facilities had been increased, but not sufficiently for the development of the fisheries. He hoped the Financial Secretary to the Treasury would not only take note of the places mentioned by the hon. Member for West Cork, but would take into consideration the necessity of increased postal facilities for the whole coast district generally. There was a point of more general interest to which he wished to direct the attention of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. There seemed to be a totally different system in regard to the established force of postmen and the unestablished men in England, Scotland, and Ireland. And, as usual, wherever there was a difference of system in the public service between the three countries, Ireland got the worst of it. [HON. MEMBERS: No, no.] Yes; he spoke from experience.
<image src="S4V0094P0I0906"/>
<col>1569</col>
He found that the proportion of established postmen in England to unestablished was as three to one; in Scotland as two to one; and in Ireland the postmen were chiefly unestablished. He knew that the established force always got the best of it in pension and pay. He hoped the Secretary to the Treasury would make inquiry into it and remedy this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04319"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. JOHN BURNS <memberconstituency>(Battersea)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: One is very reluctant indeed to occupy the time of the House of Commons on petty matters of postal administration in the small hours of the morning. But the fact that we are driven to discuss a vast concern such as the Post Office, employing 170,000 people, and spending an enormous number of millions at such a time, is evidence that the Department is not managed in the best possible way. Although I am disinclined to keep Members out of their beds, I wish to say one or two words before the division. The fact that we have various grievances continually brought up&#x2014;although there is certainly one with which I do not agree&#x2014;is to me proof positive that we ought to devise some more reasonable method of disposing of the grievances of the postmen, and a better method of dealing with the complaints of the commercial public against the Post Office. The hon. Member for Canterbury has proved the necessity for the direct representation of the Post Office in this House. I venture to say that some of the grievances which we have heard of, as to the mismanagement of the Post Office, would not be heard of by way of needless questions and speeches if we could get in contact with the representative of the Post Office in this House. I have only asked six questions in ten years, and I hope I take as much interest in some departments of administration as hon. Members who speak for the Post Office officials. I am not specially concerned with the Post Office; but in other Departments I can see the Minister, and by a conversation over the tea table or in the smoke room we can save endless questions and avoid needless waste of time which are caused by the want of a direct representative of the Post Office in the House of Commons. If the First Lord of the
<col>1570</col>
Treasury wants to save the time of the House, let him have the Postmaster General in this House. I venture to say he could save half an hour or an hour almost every day by such a change. The hon. Member for Canterbury comes here year after year and makes up a powerful indictment against the mismanagement of the Post Office, and its flagrant inconsistencies; and the public are with the hon. Member, and against the Post Office. Why is this? It is simply because the Secretary to the Treasury, however energetic, and however willing he may be to discharge the duties of his dual post, cannot get close to the heads of the Department or be intimate with the endless detail of postal work. If the Postmaster General and the hon. Member for Canterbury were locked up in a room for five or six hours, and fought out the matters in dispute, with an impartial umpire looking through the window, nine out of ten questions put in the House would not be required, and much inconvenience to the public would be avoided. There is another matter. I am under the impression that the Secretary to the Treasury is the last-individual in the world to be selected to do the work here of the Post Office. The Treasury ought to be the watchdog of economy and finance; and it should be the duty of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to look after expenditure so as to secure greater value for the taxpayers' money. Instead of occupying his time in this important duty of economic watchdog, the Secretary to the Treasury is made the departmental drudge of the Postmaster General to the detriment and exclusion of his supervisory Treasury duties.<lb/>
Now, Sir, I desire to have from the House an expression of opinion on one or two points connected with the Post Office. Our mail carts are a scandal and a disgrace, and the horses are a disgrace to any Government that claims to be humane. I feel very keenly on these points. I do not wish to worry, the Secretary to the Treasury with innumerable questions about dirty mail carts or horses that ought to be in the knacker's yard, or drivers who seem to be clothed from the salvage sales of old clothes dealers in the East End of London. I
<image src="S4V0094P0I0907"/>
<col>1571</col>
do not wish to put questions to the hon. Gentleman on these subjects, but if the Postmaster General were in this House I would point out to him how the County Council horse their Fire Brigade, how they clothe their firemen, and park constables, and by direct argument, and I hope good reasoning, I could show him a more excellent way of managing the mail cart service than he now practises. I could give him many excellent reasons for an improved distribution of letters, books, and newspapers and the practical and profitable extension of the Post Office service. I am convinced that the public as well as the staff are discontented, and the time of the House of Commons will be wasted in the future even more than it now is, because the Secretary to the Treasury may make up his mind that the House of Commons is determined to improve the Post Office. In these days of foreign competition and the necessity for rapid transit, the public are looking to the Post Office as a means of meeting some of that competition by the conveyance of light articles, which the Post Office will not undertake to carry. Therefore I claim that the Postmaster General should be in this House, so as to be in touch with well informed and representative opinion. I also claim that when we have the Postmaster General in this House we shall also have a small Committee appointed from both sides, and without distinction of party, to be joined to the Postmaster General to help him to manage this vast Department. I would make the hon. Gentleman the Member for Canterbury one of that Committee. Five or six Members would be associated with the Postmaster General, and instead of the hon. Member for Canterbury or the hon. Member for Battersea delaying the House of Commons at twenty-five minutes to one in the morning over necessary but unimportant details and grievances they should be closeted with the Postmaster General once a week, or once a fortnight, or once a month, and nineteen out of twenty Post Office questions which now take up public time would be dealt with by that Committee&#x2014;questions not only affecting the employees, but also matters with reference to the extension of the
<col>1572</col>
Post Office generally would be considered. I know what the bureaucrats will urge. I know what the ossified officials at St. Martin's le Grand will say. They will say that it would kill discipline. It would do no such thing. Discipline is impossible without confidence, and the present system breeds mistrust. I can give a parallel instance. We have in London a fire brigade consisting of 1,200 men. They are admittedly organised on a military basis; that is, that the chief of the fire brigade does what he likes with his men in the technical duties they have to discharge, and the County Council does not interfere with him. He has full discretion, not only in regard to the discipline of his men, but also with regard to their administrative management. An executive committee of the Council is joined to the chief of the fire brigade, and when any of the men have a grievance they have a right to approach that committee, either through their chief or directly, and the fact that last year only three men desired to approach the committee is an indication that discipline can be maintained by that system, which also gives the chief of the fire brigade the assistance of a committee in the technical, practical, and economical administration of the fire service to an extent which would not be possible if he alone were responsible, as the Postmaster General is, for the Post Office. I believe that one of these days such a Committee will be appointed for the Post Office, and the sooner it is appointed the better for the present condition and the future improvement of the Post Office. I shall have to reiterate that view, because I want the House of Commons to believe that it is the only solution of the problem, the only way of obtaining the confidence of the men and giving satisfaction to the general public.<lb/>
My last point is this. It will be said these Standing Committees will not work. I do not believe it. Take the case of the Navy. Whenever the Navy makes a blunder over Belleville boilers, or anything else, who are the people to put it right? The House of Commons throws over the permanent officials and experts and gets three or four practical engineer Members from its own ranks to show the permanent officials how not to perpetrate similar mistakes in future. When the War Office does not manage its cam-
<image src="S4V0094P0I0908"/>
<col>1573</col>
paign with military precision in South Africa, who are appointed to show them a more excellent way? Why, a Committee of business men from both sides of the House, joined with military men, who show the War Office what should be done. What I want is that the Post Office should be shown how to avoid mistakes, just as are the Navy and the Army. If such a Committee is good enough for the War Office and the Navy in times of difficulty, blunder, and mismanagement, it ought to be good enough for the Post Office to prevent mistakes. Therefore I ask the serious consideration of the House of Commons to the view that I now express, that there should be a small Committee appointed by the House of Commons to assist the permanent officials in each of the great spending departments, which when an unreasonable claim is put forward would resist it, but when a legitimate grievance is brought forward would support it with all the weight of knowledge and deserved sympathy. Pending the appointment of that Committee, the next alternative is that the Government should see the folly of having the Postmaster General in another place, and that he should be brought as soon as possible into the House of Commons. If the Secretary to the Treasury is made Postmaster General, we shall stand up and criticise him with greater frankness and more justification, because he will then have the whole responsibility, and we will not let him off as we do now, nine times out of ten, because we know that Dr. Jekyll is in the House of Lords and Mr. Hyde in the House of Commons. The Secretary to the Treasury is not responsible, and until he is made responsible he can put us off, as he has done to-night, with great courtesy and plausibility, but with little knowledge. We want the man whose hand is on the machine, and to whom we can bring responsibility home, and if the hon. Member who moved the reduction gets to a division I shall support him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04320"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: Several questions have been mentioned to-night, two of them of great scope and importance, the others being questions of detail. The majority of them have been used to illustrate the thesis
<col>1574</col>
which the hon. Member for Canterbury and the hon. Gentleman opposite, who desire to see a House of Commons Committee to inquire into Post Office matters, put before the House, and which was brought forward not so much to get an answer at this time as for the purpose of showing what is the effect of having the Postmaster General in another place. There are two questions of detail which I am bound in courtesy to deal with as shortly as I can. Two hon. Gentlemen from Ireland spoke about the better delivery of letters in places in that country, and in particular in connection with the fishing trade, to develop which considerable efforts have been made. The Government are naturally interested in the question, and hon. Members will find us not unfriendly in regard to what may be necessary in that connection. At the same time, I must say, as I have already said, that we must have regard to the amount of business which there is to be done, and to the amount of revenue obtainable, and the proportion which one bears to the other. We cannot, with the best goodwill in the world, agree to give all the postal facilities which may be required by every individual village or town, without having regard to the cost of that service and the revenue to be derived from it. The hon. Member for West Islington complained that he had been in correspondence with the Postmaster General for eight months without getting satisfaction. I am afraid we could not give the hon. Gentleman satisfaction except by doing everything he wished, and that would not be possible in most cases. The hon. Member referred to certain postmen in London who have to do extra duty on Sundays. The amount the men received in respect of that duty, which is in the nature of overtime pay, becomes part of their pensionable emoluments.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04321"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: How can it be described as extra duty when it has been going on for thirty years?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04322"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: It is a duty for which the men have volunteered and which they are anxious to retain. They volunteer for it every Sunday in the year, and the Postmaster

<col>1575</col>
General felt it necessary to interfere not only in the interests of the men, but also of the postal service, and to put restrictions on the amount of Sunday labour which any man might do. I think it is not in the interests of the individual or of the service that a man should, week in and week out, work seven days.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04323"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: Did not the Postmaster General arrive at that decision only last year?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04324"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: If the hon. Gentleman informs me of that, I accept his statement. It is said that these men have been regularly engaged on this work. They volunteered for the work and were prepared to do it Sunday after Sunday, and the Postmaster General accordingly issued an order preventing any man from doing any more than a reasonable amount of work. That had the effect of reducing the immediate emoluments of these men in proportion to the decreased work, and to that extent will reduce their pensions. The hon. Gentleman says that that is a great hardship; but no man has a right to claim overtime without regard to its effect on himself and the service, or to the discretion invested in the Postmaster General. Then the hon. Gentleman says, Why should not these men be pensioned on the basis of another three years? They have not been doing this extra work, and therefore are not entitled to an extra pension, and we should be breaking the law if we did that. I am therefore sorry I cannot promise to do what the hon. Gentleman asks.<lb/>
I now come to the larger question brought forward by the hon. Member for Canterbury and the hon. Member opposite. The hon. Member for Canterbury is well known for the interest he takes in Post Office questions, and he is honourably associated with Post Office reform. There are many improvements which he still thinks might be effected in the service, and he seems to think that it would be a specific for every grievance if the Postmaster General sat in this House. I am afraid that that would not satisfy my hon. friend or remove all cause of complaint. The fact of the matter is that the Post Office business is very difficult and complex.
<col>1576</col>
It consists to a very large extent of details which require a great deal of attention to master, and I am not by any means certain that from the administrative point of view, as my right hon. friend who is now President of the Board of Agriculture stated on the previous occasion, it is not a positive advantage for the Postmaster General to have the greater freedom and the larger leisure which a Member of the other House has. In any case, I venture to put it to the House that the process of forming a Government and selecting the persons most fitted for each office is already a sufficiently difficult task, and that the House will be making that task infinitely more difficult if it lays it down that this or that particular office must necessarily be held by a Member of this House. I hope the House will not add any such restriction. Then the hon. Member for Battersea said that if the Postmaster General was to be represented in this House the worst person to choose for that purpose was the Financial Secretary. I confess I do not agree with him. [An HON. MEMBER: It is not a personal matter.] Of course, if it had been a personal charge, I would not have made this remark; but I am treating the matter differently, and am not speaking of it as a personal matter at all. The Post Office and the Treasury are necessarily brought into very close contact. It is one of the complaints of the hon. Member for Canterbury and other hon. Gentlemen interested in Post Office reform, or perhaps I might say change in post Office methods of management, that the control of the Treasury is too direct and too far reaching, and that above all, as we were told the other night, it is ignorant and unsympathetic. What better cure could anyone devise for that state of affairs than making the representative of the Treasury responsible for the Post Office in this House? If it be the case that the Treasury has delayed and thwarted Post Office reform&#x2014;which I do not admit&#x2014;I say there could be no better remedy or no better means of putting a strong check on the Treasury than by making the representative of the Treasury also the representative of the Post Office, and therefore the scapegoat for its misdeeds. I think it must be obvious to hon. Gentlemen that the
<image src="S4V0094P0I0910"/>
<col>1577</col>
fact that the Financial Secretary has to answer for the Post Office in this House forces upon him an interest in Post Office work, and brings him into contact with the complaints and demands of the public, which under other circumstances he would not be likely to possess. Under our present system the Treasury has to exercise some control over the spending and revenue departments, and it is not altogether a misfortune that the Financial Secretary should have to answer for these matters in the House of Commons. My hon. friend says he objects to Treasury control, but if the Treasury did not occasionally, so to speak, focus different demands and compare the urgency of one with another, if there were not some department to exercise this control over the spending departments, I think that the complaints of hon. Gentlemen as to the increase of taxation would be even louder than their present complaints of the Treasury.<lb/>
The other large question was that raised by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydvil. He desired to see a Committee of this House appointed to examine into alleged Post Office grievances. The hon. Member said that it was true that a Committee had sat on the matter, but he called it a Departmental Committee, and he said it was similar to a jury of malefactors trying their own case. Just let me remind the House that the Chairman of that Committee was Lord Tweedmouth. There was nothing peculiarly official about him&#x2014;I say it, of course, with all respect. Another Member was Mr. Llewellyn Smith, Labour Commissioner of the Board of Trade, and there were three other officials. I do not think it would be possible to select a stronger or more impartial Committee, or a Committee more competent to carry out the very far-reaching investigation entrusted to It. The hon. Gentleman talked as if this Committee were mainly composed of officials, and that, therefore, it had some peculiar interest in keeping down expenditure, and so on. But a civil servant at the head of a great department has no personal interest, such as a manufacturer would have, in cutting down wages. His inclination rather would be to give way for the sake of peace and quietness. What I wish to call the attention of the
<col>1578</col>
House to is that no grievance has been brought before the House either to-night or on Friday night which was not carefully examined by the Tweedmouth Committee, and which was not remedied if that Committee recommended that it should be remedied. All the recommendations of that Committee have been carried into effect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04325"><sup>*</sup><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE</member><membercontribution> said that the point of his statement was that rural postmen were not being appointed in accordance with the recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee and were only being paid 16s. per week.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04326"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: I think the hon. Member does not understand the recommendations of the Tweedmouth Committee. If he will give me a specific instance I think I will be able to show him the bearing of the Report of the Committee on the matter. I say no fresh grievance has been brought under our notice. It is therefore not a new case which a Commission, if appointed, would have to try. It would be the old issue, which has been already decided. We are now asked to constitute a new court of inquiry and if the House consents to that there will be no end, as long as a single request is not granted, to these demands. There will still be complaints as to the character of the tribunal, still requests for further inquiries, and there will still be the same kind of pressure placed on Members of the House of Commons. I beg the House to remember after all what is the position of the Post Office employee. He is in many respects a very favourable specimen of the working man, and what he gets he gets at the expense of the whole body of the taxpayers, including the working men, many of them less favourably situated. He gets good wages for the work he has to do, he gets a stripe allowance which amounts to 6s. after twenty-five or thirty years service, he has a right to a pension at the age of sixty or if incapacitated in work earlier, and he has holidays and sick leave on full pay extending to a maximum of six months. Is it to be wondered at that with these terms of employment offered there is no difficulty whatever in filling any of these places? On the contrary, there is great demand for them. Every
<image src="S4V0094P0I0911"/>
<col>1579</col>
hon. Member knows from his own experience how many applicants there are who desire to enter the Post Office service. I do not think postmen would be so ill-advised as ever to act upon the threat held out by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydvil to the effect that if the House of Commons could not see eye to eye with the men and did not obey their behests they would cause a stoppage of the whole postal system of the country. If they ever did that, I think they would find that there was a public opinion roused against them stronger than anything of which they have any conception. It is only if they are moderate and reasonable that they can expect to have public opinion on their side. If they were to adopt measures of that kind, regardless of the cost or inconvenience they would inflict upon their countrymen, I think it is not the business of the country or the general public, but the ill-advised men themselves who would be the greatest sufferers.<lb/>
In conclusion, I have only two words to say, and they apply both to Members of this House and to postal servants. A great deal has been said about the inaccessibility of the Postmaster General. One hon. Member after the discussion on Friday came to me and said, "Why do you not do as we do in the business firm with which I am connected? If any man has a grievance, all he has to do is to go to the general manager and put it before him. Why can you not do that in the G. P. O.?" I said, "That is exactly what the postal employees can do." The Postmaster General has expressed his readiness to receive representatives drawn from any class of men to state their case in regard to the work in which they are employed and the conditions of their service. In the same way I venture to say to hon. Members of this House that they will always find the Postmaster General most ready to meet them and to hear any point they may wish to put before him if they prefer a personal interview. I have only to add that the Postmaster General himself would do his utmost if, instead of asking questions in this House, hon. Members wrote to him, to see that they got their answers at the earliest possible moment. We have now discussed this Vote at considerable length, both on Friday last and
<col>1580</col>
again to-night, and I hope the House will consent to an early division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04327"><member>MR. WILLIAM REDMOND <memberconstituency>(Clare, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The hon. Gentleman has made an, appeal to the House to come to an early division upon this Vote. He said that on Friday last these matters were discussed at some length, and that they had been again, discussed at some length to-night. That is quite true, but I rise for the purpose of emphasising the complaint of the hon. Member for Battersea of the action of the Government in insisting that important matters in connection with a great public spending Department should be brought on at this hour of the night. I am very reluctant, to prolong this debate unduly, but I do say that when, we have 670 Members of this House, each of whom represents a district largely interested, as it must be, in the whole administration of the Post Office Department, it is rather a large order to ask us to dismiss the entire subject in the course of a few hours on Friday, and a few hours at this time in the morning. The practice of bringing matters of this kind before the attention of Parliament at this hour is a bad one, and if it is necessary to have these late sittings I say that the late sittings should be devoted to the discussion of matters other than the great spending departments of the country, such as the Post Office. Upon this point I will only say that the time given us for the discussion is quite inadequate. Unfortunately, I was not able to be here on Friday last. If I had been present I should have taken the opportunity of bringing forward a great many matters connected with the administration of the Post Office in Ireland However, I had not that opportunity, and certainly at this hour of the night I should not receive either the attention of the Financial Secretary or the consideration of the House if I attempted, to go into details in regard to those matters. It is not fair on the part of the Government to put Members into the position, if they want to discuss what they consider to be faults, drawbacks, and flaws in Post Office administration, of having to sit up the whole night in order to do so. The hon. Member for one of the divisions of Cork put a question to the Financial Secretary with regard to the locality which he represents,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0912"/>
<col>1581</col>
but the hon. Gentleman did not condescend to give any reply or explanation on the point brought forward. There are many Irish Members on these benches who could, if they had the time, bring forward what they rightly consider to be shortcomings in reference to this Department. But if they rose to do so now they would be greeted with cries of "Divide," and they would receive no better treatment than was accorded to the hon. Member for West Cork. We cannot discuss these matters in the form of question and answer, and if we attempt to do so we are at once told that the Irish Members are asking too many questions. I say you should give us a few hours at a reasonable time. We shall have no further opportunity whatever of asking, in the form of a speech, a single question with regard to the administration of the Post Office. I deliberately characterise t as a perfectly monstrous piece of mismanagement on the part of the Government that the House of Commons should be asked at nearly half-past one in the morning to pass, with practically no discussion, this enormous sum, which covers, one might almost say, the whole cost of the Post Office administration of the country. If there are complaints outside in the ranks of postal officials the reason is largely to be found in the fact that those who are acquainted with the grievances, and would like to state them to the House, are not given a proper opportunity for doing so. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury spoke of the Post Office officials as if they were a body of men anxious to bully the House of Commons, to dictate to the Government, and to insist upon every single thing which they demanded being at once granted. He seemed to imply that if those demands were not granted the men would take measures of the most extreme description, and measures calculated to upset the convenience of the whole country. I do not think the hon. Gentleman is justified for one moment in speaking of the Post Office officials in that way.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0094P0-04330"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: I said I did not believe the Post Office officials would take that course. I referred to the suggestions made in the speech of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydvil, and I said that I did not believe the Post Office officials would do that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04331"><member>MR. KEIR HARDIE</member><membercontribution>: I made no suggestion of the sort. What I said was that if the House of Commons did not pay attention to the claims of these men their patience might give way.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0094P0-04332"><member>MR. WILLIAM REDMOND</member><membercontribution>: I do not at all attribute to the Financial Secretary any statement to the effect that the Post Office officials contemplated a general strike, but I beg respectfully to be allowed to adhere to my description of the references made by him to those officials as references which seemed to imply that the men were a sort of dictators, that they desired to bully Parliament, and that unless what they demanded was granted at once they would take extreme steps. My view is&#x2014;and every fair minded man must admit it&#x2014;that the exact opposite is the case. Post Office officials consider that in certain respects they have not been properly treated. After all, there is no body of public servants in any branch of State administration the members of which do not from time to time seek to better their position or to have remedied grievances from which they consider they are made to suffer illegitimately and unnecessarily. Why, therefore, should not the Post Office officials be allowed to do so in a reasonable way if they consider it necessary and proper? The hon. Gentleman says they are paid good wages. I do not deny it. I do not deny that they have some advantages in the public service, but the hon. Gentleman must admit that that is no reason whatever why they should be deprived of the right of putting forward in a legitimate way the grievances and drawbacks from which they consider they are unnecessarily suffering. As far as I know the Post Office officials in Ireland, that is all they have ever done and they have done it at all times in a reasonable and moderate way.<lb/>

<col>1583</col>
The hon. Gentleman the Financial Secretary says that the case of the employees was tried by the Tweedmouth Committee not long ago, and cannot now be reopened. I say that their case was not tried fairly. I do not question the strict impartiality of the Tweedmouth Committee, but from the description given by the Secretary to the Treasury I do say that it was not a Committee capable of fairly considering the claims of the men on account of the manner in which it was constituted. The hon. Gentleman said that there was only one Post Office official on the Committee, and that was quite true. The rest of the Committee, however, were Government officials, and everybody knows perfectly well that when a Committee composed exclusively of Government officials sits down at a table to consider the grievances put forward by the rank and file of any branch of the public service there is sure to be, consciously or unconsciously, an official bias against the employees. The tendency of those officials will be to uphold the views of the heads of the Department, and they would rather incline against the views of those who were putting forward the grievances of the employees. That is what took place before the Tweedmouth Committee which did not have a member upon it who could be described as directly or indirectly representing the men. That is what the Post Office employees complain of, and I think it is a most reasonable request that the whole matter of their grievances should be submitted to a Commission in which they will have the most implicit confidence by reason of the fact that they will have upon that Commission one or two gentlemen who will represent their views. That is the kind of Commission asked for, and undoubtedly the Tweedmouth Committee was not one of that kind. I think this demand is perfectly justified by the circumstances.<lb/>
I wish to make one reference to the Postmaster General. I am not going to say whether it would be to the benefit of the public service that the Postmaster General ought to be in the House of Commons, or in what has been described as "another place." I do say, however, that it is a remarkable thing that, as far as my memory carries me back, I believe I am right in saying that a great majority
<col>1584</col>
of the Postmasters General have always been in the House of Commons. I can say without fear of contradiction that the very best Postmasters General we ever had, including the late Mr. Fawcett, did sit in the House of Commons, and they were in a position to answer the questions put forward by hon. Members in regard to the Post Office Department. Those are facts which the hon. Gentleman opposite may set off against the advantages he has put forth in regard to the Postmaster having a seat in another place, wherever that may be. If it is necessary to have a peer as Postmaster General, there is one thing which I think it is his bounden duty to do as the representative of a great Department, and that is that upon occasions like this, when the Vote for his Department is being discussed, and when the views of all sections and parties are being put forward, the very least he can do is to come and take his seat in the gallery here and listen to what is said in the way of complaint. If he was not in a position to rise in this House and answer straight off the questions put to him, as they are now put to the Secretary of the Treasury, then, at least, on hearing the debate his Lordship&#x2014;[Ministerial laughter]&#x2014;hon. Gentlemen opposite are evidently not too sleepy to be able to laugh, and I do not know exactly what class of constituencies they represent. I do not suppose that they represent any great section of the democracy, but if they do, and if they will go to their constituency and put the views I am expressing before them, they will find that a great number of their constituents will agree with what I have said.<lb/>
After all, a Peer who is at the head of one of the greatest Government Departments in this country, and who is paid by the taxpayers of this country the sum of &#x00A3;5,000 a year.&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: No, no&#x0021; His salary is &#x00A3;2,500.] I should have thought that any Peer would have turned up his nose as such a small salary as that. At any rate, a member of "another place," who is the head of one of the greatest Departments in this country, and who is not above taking pay from the people of this country for looking after that Department, might at least, for the time being, have the humbleness to come, once in a way,
<image src="S4V0094P0I0914"/>
<col>1585</col>
down to this House, and listen to the complaints of the representatives of the people whose money he is taking and putting into his own pocket. [Ministerial cries of "Divide, divide&#x0021;"] Hon. Members opposite always cry "Divide" when they hear anything particularly true. When we have a discussion such as this, and such as that which took place last Friday on the Post Office Vote; when we have the Member for Canterbury getting up in this House and urging those reforms which everybody must thank him for urging&#x2014;even then the Postmaster General will not come to the gallery and listen to the debate. But if the hon. Gentleman the Chief Secretary for Ireland got up to make a speech about Irish landlordism, they would always see the Postmaster General there, more especially if there was anything being dealt with in connection with the Irish land question, and if the hon. Member for South Tyrone was about. Sometimes I forget that he is a member of the House of Lords, and I refrain from looking upon him with the proper amount of respect with which I always ought to look upon a member of the House of Lords. At any rate, I put it forward with all the earnestness I can that, while I do not wish to disparage the hon. Gentleman the Secretary to the Treasury, who is most anxious to do the best he can in the position in which he finds himself, I say we have a right to demand that the head of this great Department should at least attend in the House of Commons, and listen to what we have got to say.<lb/>
It is always a bad thing to turn out the heads of any great Department at the same time. We have got a Secretary to the Treasury who is new to the Post Office. I have no doubt that he will acquit himself creditably when he has been there some time, but he is new to the work. The two principal heads responsible for the working of this great Department are practically new to the work, and I would like to know why the Government did not leave the present President of the Board of Agriculture in the Post Office Department? Why did they not leave him there, or, better still, why did they not make him Postmaster General, when everybody knew that he knew far more about it than any
<col>1586</col>
other member of the Government, because he had administered that Department for five years in this House as Secretary to the Treasury? We have got a brand new Secretary to the Treasury, and we have got an Irish landlord for Postmaster General, who sits in the House of Lords. The Post Office Department is not administered as it should be, and if the time of this House is taken up upon questions in reference to the Post Office hon. Members who ask questions should not be blamed, but the Government ought to be blamed, because they do not give to hon. Members a proper opportunity of discussing this great question at a reasonable time.</membercontribution></p>

In Ireland there were 3,000 postmasters and sub-postmasters, and altogether they were paid a less total sum than 2,300 postmasters and sub-masters employed in Scotland. That was a point which required some explanation. Ireland was treated unfairly in regard to salaries and promotions.</membercontribution></p>
