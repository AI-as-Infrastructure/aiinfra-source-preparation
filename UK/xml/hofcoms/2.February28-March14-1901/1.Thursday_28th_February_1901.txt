<title>ROYAL CORPS OF CONSTRUCTORS.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00198"><member>*LORD BRASSEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed by the Admiralty under the Earl of North-brook, recommending the constitution of the Royal Corps of Constructors, and to the increasing duties and responsibilities of the professional officers at the Admiralty and dockyards. In introducing this subject I make no reflection on the Board of Admiralty or on Sir William White. The faults which I shall endeavour to point out are not of recent date. They are more or less inherent in any system which must be administered under rigid rules. To Sir William White the highest praise is due. A noble fleet has been constructed for the Navy under his direction, and to his ability the highest testimony is borne by the leading men of his own profession, abroad as well as at home.<lb/>
Turning to the general question, it is the settled policy of the country that the British Navy should be maintained at such a standard of strength as will secure the integrity of the Empire, and adequately protect our lines of communication across the ocean. The number of men voted for the Navy has been doubled since I first entered Parliament, while the sum voted for new construction in the last Estimates prepared by Lord Goschen was no less than &#x00A3;8,460,000. There are some who think that our expenditure, large as it is, scarcely suffices for our
<image src="S4V0090P0I0120"/>
<col>5</col>
needs. When, however, we compare the shipbuilding Votes of our own Navy with those of France and Russia, and note the fact that, taken together, the combined expenditure of the two Powers is considerably less than that incurred for the British Navy; and if we further take into view that shipbuilding is more costly elsewhere than with us, it seems a clear duty, before adding to Estimates, to secure the most effective application of the vast sums which the wise liberality of Parliament has already placed in the hands of the Admiralty.<lb/>
In the department of construction all depends on the scientific attainments of the naval architect and the practical knowledge and experience of the shipbuilder. The professional work for the British Navy requires a large body of officers. It has been the policy of the Government to recruit for this service from the more promising students at the dockyard schools, and to train them at the public expense. The training is admirable. The positions opened to these highly-trained men, more especially on first entering the service, long remained unsatisfactory. The necessity for an improvement in the status of the constructive branch was brought before Lord North-brook by Sir Houston Stewart, who was for many years an able and popular Controller of the Navy. On his advice a Departmental Committee was appointed, over which, as Civil Lord of the Admiralty, I had the honour to preside. My colleagues were the late Sir Geoffrey Hornby, Mr. George Rendell, and Sir Nathaniel Barnaby was Sir William White.<lb/>
Following, as we so often do in matters naval, the lead taken by France, a Royal School of Naval Architects had been established in 1864 at South Kensington. The school was subsequently transferred to the Naval College at Greenwich. The English training was in no respect inferior to the French. On the practical side it was perhaps superior. We had failed, as I have said, to provide suitable positions for our highly-trained men. On completing an elaborate course of professional study, the only position open to the students was that of an established workman, with the prospect of an early appointment as a supplementary dockyard draughtsman. In France, on the completion of their course, the students at once become junior officers
<col>6</col>
of the Genie Maritime. Sir Houston Stewart recommended an organisation for the British Navy similar to that established in France. This scheme was approved by the Committee. The result was the constitution of (the present Royal Corps of Constructors. The new organisation substantially improved the position of the junior officers. It was more difficult to deal with the superior ranks, and quite impossible to provide for special cases under fixed rules. I need not trouble your Lordships by going through the list in detail. It is sufficient to say that in the case of the Royal Corps of Constructors, as indeed in all branches of the public service, we find a tendency to employ large numbers, while there are but few valuable appointments.<lb/>
The Corps of Constructors, like every other properly organised body, should be under a head whose superior authority is fully acknowledged. The chief should be supported by a stronger staff, under more direct responsibility to the country than at present. To Sir William White's subordinates the opportunity is too rarely given of making a name by professional ability and exertion. In the public service honours are coveted even more than pecuniary rewards. The C.B. has been given to three members of the clerical staff of the Secretary's Department at the Admiralty. No such mark of distinction has been given to any officers serving under Sir William White, whether at the Admiralty or the dockyards. It seems hardly consistent that the skill and ingenuity required to design and build a first-class battleship should be less rewarded than the performance, however efficient, of administrative duties. The Admiralty alone can judge as to the claims of j individuals to an increase of emoluments, or to honorary rewards. This, however, is certain, that many members of the Corps of Constructors&#x2014;and not rarely the ablest &#x2014; leave the public service. To give only a few examples. The well-known shipbuilding yard of Clydebank is under the management of Mr. Luke; the Barrow yard of the Vickers-Maxim Company is under Mr. Dunn, from whose designs a most powerful battleship has recently been built for Japan; the Armstrong shipbuilding yard is under Mr. Watts, whose cruisers, in the opinion of some authorities, have not their match in any navy; the yard at
<image src="S4V0090P0I0121"/>
<col>7</col>
Fairfield is under Professor Elgar, who gave up the appointment of Director of Dockyards in order to take the management. To this list I might add Mr. Biles, Professor at the Glasgow University and in large and lucrative practice as a consulting naval architect. All these gentlemen are in receipt of emoluments of from &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;4,000 a year upwards. Lastly, we have the cases of Sir Edward Reed and Sir William White, both of whom had left the Admiralty to take more advantageous positions and were brought back not without difficulty to fill the post of Director of Naval Construction. When we have to deal with the employment of labour and the economical use of materials l on a vast scale, and with designing work requiring talent of a high order, the wide contrast between the practice of our private employers and the cast-iron rules of the Treasury gives occasion for very grave reflection.<lb/>
The condition of things which obtains to-day differs little from that described in the Memorandum which formed the basis of the reference to the Committee on Constructors. Sir Houston Stewart objected that&#x2014;
<quote>"No proper provision was made for men educated at the Naval College. Year by year their numbers increased, and no permanent positions were open to them of the character for which their training specially fitted them. There was consequently a great amount of dissatisfaction, and a large proportion quitted the Admiralty service as soon as possible."</quote>
The temptation offered to men of the highest qualifications must always exist, but it should be possible to reduce its influence. In the constructive branch at the Admiralty, in so far as it is known to the public at large, responsibility seems unduly centralised. The Royal yacht has been a conspicuous instance. The want of stability when first put into water was the result of carelessness in matters of detail, for which those subordinate to the Director of Naval Construction should have been responsible. But Sir William White accepted the entire responsibility. It was chivalrous. It has brought out the more strongly our undue dependence on a single officer. In dealing with a vast expenditure of thirteen millions sterling on shipbuilding, repairs, and maintenance, it is clearly wrong that the Director of Construction should bear all the blame for failure and receive all the
<col>8</col>
credit for success. The country should have an assurance that he has around him a staff able to share in his responsibility, and qualified for promotion to the highest posts. This is the conclusion to which I hope I have brought your Lordships. It is, perhaps, desirable to impress these views on the Treasury even more than on the Board of Admiralty.<lb/>
It is an obvious remark that conditions which have been gradually brought about cannot be suddenly changed. To surround and support the Director of Construction with a staff in the position formerly held by the members of the Council of Naval Construction must be the work: of time. High appointments should clearly be the reward of approved merit. In dealing with that difficult branch of their administration, to which I have called attention, I would respectfully urge that the Admiralty should be allowed by the Treasury a free hand to do what is best for the public advantage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00199"><member>*THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (The Earl of SELBORNE)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Lord who has just sat down has, even in the presence of such high authorities as I see around me, a, very particular qualification for bringing this subject under the notice of the House, for, as he himself has told you, he was, the chairman of the Committee upon whose Report and recommendation the Office of Naval Construction and the Royal Corps of Naval Constructors were constituted. I do not think it is possible to exaggerate the importance of this branch of Admiralty work. The Controller's department is, I think, the chief department at the Admiralty, and in the Controller's department the branch under the Director of Naval Construction is the most important. Consequently, the, organisation and working and the future prospects of this branch of Admiralty work must always be a matter of constant, anxiety to any First Lord or any Board of Admiralty.<lb/>
Before touching briefly on the largo principles which the noble Lord has raised, perhaps he will allow me to follow him in the historical retrospect which he sketched out, and to point out that in one or two respects, no doubt inadvertently, he has slightly misrepresented the exact position of affairs. For instance, the noble Lord laid considerable stress upon the fact that the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0122"/>
<col>9</col>
Admiralty had lost many&#x2014;I think the word he used was "many"&#x2014;of the more promising naval constructors because the prospects open to them in the Admiralty yards are not so favourable as, and are not a sufficient counter attraction to, the prospects offered by the private yards. I do not profess to have examined at length into the position of affairs that obtained in this respect before the year 1883, which was the year in which the Committee appointed by Lord North-brook, and of which the noble Lord was chairman, sat; but I find that since that year &#x2014; the year the Royal Corps of Constructors was constituted &#x2014; only four naval constructors have left the Admiralty yards for engagements in private yards before they reached their proper term of pension. One of the four was Mr. Watts, who succeeded Sir William (then Mr.) White at the Elswick Works when he left to join the Admiralty, and another was a gentleman whom Mr. Watts took with him. Besides those four there was Mr. Dunn, who, as the noble Lord stated, joined the Vickers-Maxim Works; but he retired in the ordinary course at the age of 60 with a pension, and then took, as be was entitled to do, this private employment.<lb/>
I do not think, therefore, that it is quite accurate for the noble Lord to say that the Admiralty has lost in recent years the services of many of its more promising young constructors; and I attribute the fact that on the whole the national service has proved sufficiently attractive to these gentlemen mainly to the labours of the Committee over which the noble Lord so ably presided. Before that Committee sat there was only one avenue through which appointments could be obtained in the construction branch of the Admiralty, and that was through an apprenticeship in the Royal dockyards. Since that time there have been three separate avenues established, and the career has always been open to private individuals who had the necessary training and could pass the examination. The corps now consists of seventy-seven members, all graduated, as is the traditional habit with any body of public servants, in lank and salaries.<lb/>
It is perfectly true that in the Royal Corps of Constructors, as in the public service generally, young men of special merit cannot be offered the special prizes that private employers offer. Every
<col>10</col>
officer in the public service has to appear in the Estimates with a definite status and a definite salary, and it is no more in my power than it is in the power of the head of any other Department to single out A or B and give him special inducements to remain, whether in the shape of bonuses or an increase of salary. Every man is obliged to work up in his grade, and all that the head of the Department can do is to give in these cases special and speedy promotion. But that on the whole the service has not proved unattractive is, I think, shown by the fact that, with all the inducements which the private yards can offer, only four have left the Admiralty service during the last seventeen years before they had reached a pensionable age. In another respect, also, I think I can correct a slight inaccuracy on the part of the noble Lord. He said, I think, that, with the exception of Sir William White, no members of this corps had received any recognition in the shape of an honour, while the Secretary's branch of the Admiralty had received several such rewards. That is not quite the case. Mr. Stainer, the civil assistant to the Admiral Superintendent of Portsmouth Dockyard, received the honour of a C.B. in 1897.<lb/>
The noble Lord, after sketching the history of the construction department of the Admiralty, proceeded to draw the moral that that department was unduly centralised, and had more work than its present staff could properly perform, and he ascribed that state of affairs to the unsympathetic reception which the proposals of the Admiralty met with at the Treasury. I presume that all First Lords of the Admiralty&#x2014;I am speaking in the presence of three noble Lords who have held that position&#x2014; have felt that they could very much improve the Treasury; but in this case it would be most unfair, if there is any deficiency in staff or over-centralisation in the Department, to lay the blame at the door of the Treasury. I speak in the presence of Lord Goschen, whom I have only just had the honour of succeeding at the Admiralty, and I am sure my noble friend will agree with me when I say that up to the time of his leaving the office all the proposals which were put forward by the Director of Naval Construction, either as to an increase in the number of his staff or an improvement in the position of individual members of the corps,
<image src="S4V0090P0I0123"/>
<col>11</col>
had been finally adopted by the Board and sanctioned by the Treasury. Therefore it would be strictly inaccurate and unfair to lay at the door of the Treasury any blame for deficiencies in this Department, if deficiencies there be.<lb/>
I cannot pass over without notice the noble Lord's allusion to the accident to the Royal yacht. There is nothing new to be said about it; the whole of the facts are well known. It is a matter of great anxiety and concern, to nobody more than to Sir William White. No man less deserved that such an accident should have occurred in the middle of his great career and public service. What the noble Lord who introduced this subject said as to the reputation of Sir William White was in no sense exaggerated. The services he has rendered to this country can only be described in the words "very great," and it is indeed unfortunate that, out of the 220 ships which up to the beginning of last year had been designed, the only one in which any error in calculation existed was the one most calculated to draw public attention to it.<lb/>
I am afraid I have detained your Lordships at undue length, but I cannot sit down without dealing with what is really the gist of the observations which the noble Lord addressed to the House. His reason for bringing the question forward was his fear that the Director of Naval Construction is overburdened with work, and that his department is too centralised. I am the last person in the world to say there cannot be any over-centralisation at the Admiralty. It is one of the great difficulties that we have to endeavour to fight against in all our public Departments. You cannot have the advantages of a system without the disadvantages. The great advantage in our democratic system with respect to these great Services is that the public interest is so keen that it gives an unfeigned support to any Government which endeavours to maintain the Services in a proper state of efficiency. But there follows the inevitable thirst for information from Parliament&#x2014;a thirst for information that requires an answer to be ready on every conceivable question of detail. That must necessarily tend to centralisation, however much you may fight against it. If you have to have in a pigeon-hole from which you can draw it at a day's notice the answer to any question which
<col>12</col>
may be asked in Parliament, the tendency of that pressure is towards centralisation.<lb/>
Again, our system requires naturally and properly very strict financial control. The stricter and more rigid the financial control, the more difficult it is for the Minister to decentralise. If responsibility for every penny spent is centred in the head of the Department or one of his principal officers the work of devolving authority throughout the branches of a Department scattered all over the world becomes well-nigh impossible. At the same time I recognise that it is the duty of the head of any Department like the Admiralty to fight constantly against this tendency and to endeavour to increase devolution and decentralisation. This I shall always strive to the utmost to do. Also I am not prepared to say that the present staff of the Director of Naval Construction is sufficient for all the work that is thrown upon him. At present the Director has twenty-nine assistants in the Admiralty, but the Vote for construction is constantly increasing and shows no tendency to diminish, nor am I prepared to say that it ought.<lb/>
The noble Lord mentioned incidentally that in recent years our Vote for construction had been greater than the Vote for construction of France and Russia combined. That is so. The House may be interested to learn that in the five-years that end on 31st March, I calculate roughly that the money spent on construction in this country would have exceeded the money spent on construction in France and Russia combined by about &#x00A3;4,300,000. I do not say that that is too much, or that it is alone a test of whether all that should be done has been done. Many other things have to be taken into consideration in addition to expenditure of money, but at all events it is an indication that we have not fallen behind in our construction to the degree that some people would have the country believe. All that, of course, must increase the work of the Constructor and his assistants. Therefore I am not prepared to dispute the noble Lord's general contention, that as the work increases so also must the staff. The noble Lord says it is very important that the staff in this department of the Admiralty should be able to continue the work from administration to administration and from generation to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0124"/>
<col>13</col>
generation without depending entirely on the genius of one man, who in the ordinary circumstances of affairs could not be permanent. I entirely agree with him.<lb/>
It is absolutely necessary that provision should be made for the continuation of the work, and you cannot choose for the position of Director of Naval Construction a public servant solely on the grounds that he has honestly and laboriously for many years served his country. You want more than a man well trained and of the highest qualities and devotion to the public service. You want a man with something like genius, or at any rate a spark of genius. The designing of a battleship is one of the greatest efforts of human imagination, as well as a triumph of mechanical education and of mathematical knowledge. If the Royal Corps of Constructors at any time is unable to furnish a man with qualifications sufficient for so great a post, then in my opinion the Board ought not to be limited to that body for their selection. It is better that a man of superior intellect and higher professional qualifications should be taken from outside the public service rather than a man of lower qualifications from inside. What we should prefer would be that the corps should be so constituted and should receive such a succession of promising young constructors from the different sources of supply that it should in course of time become self-contained. The importance of the subject must be my excuse for having gone on beyond the limits that I had laid down for myself. I can only thank the noble Lord for bringing the question before the House, and assure him that I believe matters have certainly improved upon the state which he found before his Committee sat, and that the work he did has helped forward a final solution.</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVAL MAN&#x1053;UVRES AND MERCHANT<lb/> SHIPPING.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00200"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask His Majesty's Government whether in April of last year the Merchant Service Guild drew attention to the dangers to merchant shipping caused by naval ships man&#x0153;uvring at night time without lights; whether this organisation was then assured by the Admiralty that the greatest care is taken on the occasions in question to avoid accident; whether in

the following July, H.M.S.

<p id="S4V0090P0-00201"><member>*THE EARL OF SELBORNE</member><membercontribution>: The noble Lord asks mo whether in April of last year the Merchant Service Guild drew attention to the dangers to merchant shipping caused by naval ships man&#x0153;uvring at night time without lights. I am informed that the Admiralty had no communication of any sort with this body before October of last year.&#x2020; The noble Lord's second question was whether this organisation was then assured by the Admiralty that the greatest care is taken on the occasions in question to avoid accident. As there was no communication at that time, of course the Admiralty could not have given this assurance. If there had been, the Admiralty would certainly have done so, because under all circumstances the greatest care is taken when His Majesty's ships have to manoeuvre without lights to avoid accidents. The third question which the noble Lord asked was whether in the following July H.M.S. "Trafalgar," steaming without lights, collided with the passenger steamer "King Orry"; and, if so, whether the Admiralty have taken any further steps in averting the appalling loss of life which may at any time arise through the practice referred to. So far as I can gather, there has never been any other occasion on which any one of His Majesty's ships when navigating without lights has ever collided with another ship; and as on this occasion, owing to I the skill of the officers in command, both of the "Trafalgar" and the passenger steamer, the collision that took place was very slight and no loss of life occurred, I am not prepared to admit that the risk is a serious one in any degree. This being so, I cannot consent to take any steps that would hinder the practice of the Navy in evolutions which are absolutely necessary for a proper training for war.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ARMY AMBULANCE WAGONS AND<lb/> HOSPITAL TENTS.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00202"><member>LORD RIBBLESDALE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to ask the Under Secretary of State
<quote>&#x2020; See correction, 1st March.</quote>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0125"/>
<col>15</col>
for War whether, in view of the time which must elapse before any conclusions can be arrived at upon the larger questions raised by the suggestions in Part IV. of the Report of the Royal Commission upon the care and treatment of the sick and wounded in the South African campaign, he can give the House an assurance that such matters as improvement in ambulance wagons and hospital tents referred to therein have already received the attention of the War Office. As your Lordships are aware, Part IV. of the Report concerns itself with suggestions with a view of remedying defects, and recommends the appointment at some early convenient time of a Departmental or other Committee of experts to inquire into and report upon the steps necessary to be taken. The two points in the list of suggested reforms to which my question refers are the improvement of the existing ambulance wagons and the selection and employment of the form of hospital tents best suited for the reception of sick and wounded in a campaign.<lb/>
I hope that in putting this question I shall not interfere in any way with the process of digestion and assimilation which we were told the other night was needed before the Secretary of State could take any step of the kind recommended by the Commission. We must all recognise, if what I have called the larger questions raised by the suggestions in Part IV. of the Report&#x2014;which I take to be from No. 1 to No. 5 on page 69 &#x2014;are to be the basis of the reference to the Committee or Commission which is likely to be appointed, that that would involve a considerable reconstruction of the whole of our Army medical system, both in time of peace and of war. That, I admit, is a very large order, though I think everyone who has read the evidence given before the Hospital Commission and their Report must admit that such reconstruction is very desirable. However, I am perfectly willing to rest content with the promise which was given in another place that on the major points there will be a thorough investigation. But although I quite agree that, grammatically, the two points in my question are governed by the first paragraph of Part IV., and so are included in the subject-matter which the Commissioners suggest an expert Committee should inquire into and report upon, I think that so much ground has been cleared upon those two points by the evidence given
<col>16</col>
before the Hospital Commission, and by the actual experience of the Commission, that the Government might do something to effect an improvement so far as ambulance wagons and hospital tents are concerned without further delay. The Commissioners reported&#x2014;
<quote>"With regard to the bearer companies, we are not satisfied with the ambulance wagons which are now being supplied to them. We have tried these wagons. We found them very heavy, requiring a large number of mules to draw them, and very jolty and uncomfortable. The type of wagon used appears not to have been materially changed or improved upon for many years. We cannot help thinking that this type of ambulance could be and should be improved."</quote>
With regard to tents, the Commissioners say&#x2014;
<quote>"We saw, during our journeys in South Africa, some other tents which appeared to us to be superior to the ordinary marquee-tents. For instance, we think that the tortoise-tent, a well-known type, is better for a war like the present, though not suited to places like India."</quote>
The Commissioners then commend the E. P. Indian tent, and go on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"Another tent which we also observed used to good purpose, especially for enteric fever patients, was the ordinary Ordnance Store tent."</quote>
The early part of the year&#x2014;a dangerous time for enteric fever&#x2014;has arrived; and it would be satisfactory to know that in regard to these matters at least something has already been done by the War Office.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00203"><member>THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (Lord RAGLAN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am glad to be able to assure the noble Lord that the two points which he mentioned have already received, and will continue to receive, the closest attention of the War Office. Changes are in contemplation in the pattern both of the ambulances and of the hospital tents, and experiments are now being made. But it is extremely difficult to find the ideal tent or the ideal wagon; and at present it is undesirable to put a stop to inquiry and experiment. Otherwise we might order a large number of wagons and tents in haste and repent at leisure, for we might find ourselves saddled with articles not only undesirable in themselves, but which, from their numbers and cost, might prevent more efficient appliances being supplied.<lb/>
The War Office is most anxious to benefit by the experience of officers who
<image src="S4V0090P0I0126"/>
<col>17</col>
have been in South Africa, some of whom are not yet home; but I may inform the noble Lord that up to the present the following steps have been taken:&#x2014;In July last a new pattern ambulance was built to the specification of the Royal Army Medical Corps and was sent down to Aldershot for experiment and report. This wagon is 1 cwt. Lighter than the old pattern, and it carries more men. The old pattern carried twelve men seated, or four seated and two on stretchers. The new pattern carries fourteen seated, or six seated and four en stretchers. We have obtained as much imformation as possible about the ambulances in use in foreign armies, especially about the Austrian ambulance, of which many favourable reports have been received. This type has been sent to Aldershot for report, and will then be sent to Woolwich, whore the officials will confer with officers of the Royal Army Medical Corps and of the transport department who have recently returned from South Africa. The question of tents, as the noble Lord knows, is much complicated by the question of climate. The tortoise tents were at first reported on very favourably from South Africa; but recent reports have not been quite so good. It is not the ideal tent in bad weather; and another, more satisfactory, seems to have been found. Trials of many kinds of touts were made last summer and autumn. Although there is unusual pressure at the War Office, no time will be lost in remedying any defects which can be dealt with immediately.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00204"><member>LORD TWEEDMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think we all agree that there is no fault to find with regard to the good intentions expressed on behalf of the War Office. But I think we have a right to know whether anything has already been done to supplement the present old-fashioned ambulance wagons in use in South Africa. Have any wagons of a better type, such as those used by the voluntary hospitals, been sent out? Such steps would not only be for the comfort of the wounded, but would be extremely valuable from the point of view of the experiments which are being conducted, and which could be better carried out in South Africa than at Aldershot. As to tents, the Commissioners say&#x2014;
<quote>"We think that the tortoise-tent, a well-known type, is better for a war like the
<col>18</col>
present, though not suited to places like India. A better tent still for many purposes is the 'E.P.' Indian tent which we saw at Stander-ton and Charlestown, although it is somewhat heavy. Another tent which we also observed used to good purpose, especially for enteric fever patients, was the ordinary Ordnance Store tent."</quote>
Have steps been taken to have a large supply of the different kinds of tents, mentioned by the Commissioners in their Report, for the present purposes of the war? It is natural that it should be thought desirable, if it is necessary to supplement the number of tents already in South Africa, that the Government should supplement them by the provision of a large number of tents of the kind indicated by the Commission appointed by the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00205"><member>LORD RAGLAN</member><membercontribution>: So far as I gather from their Report, the Commissioners do not say that a large number of supplementary tents are required in South Africa, but they recommend that a Committee should be appointed to choose a pattern of tent for the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00206"><member>LORD TWEEDMOUTH</member><membercontribution>: My question is, Has a further quantity of tents been sent out or not, and have steps been taken to send to South Africa supplementary ambulance wagons likely to be more comfortable than those at present in use?</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE PAARDEBERG ARMISTICE.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00264"><member>MR. YERBURGH <memberconstituency>(Chester)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether he can inform the House what general granted the armistice of twenty-four hours to General Cronje, which Lord Roberts on his arrival at Paardeberg, as he states in his despatch of the 28th February, 1900, immediately revoked on the ground that the request for an armistice was obviously only an expedient to gain time for reinforcements to arrive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00265"><member>THE SECRETARY of STATE for WAR (Mr. BRODRICK, <memberconstituency>Surrey, Guildford</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: The paragraph referred to is a little misleading. The facts are as follows: On the morning of the 19th February a message arrived from General Cronje asking for an armistice for twenty-four hours to enable him to bury his dead and send out his wounded. Lord Kitchener, as chief of the staff, replied to the message in the name of the senior officer at Paardeberg&#x2014; Lieutenant-General French &#x2014; who was with the cavalry some little distance off, to the effect that the message was being sent to the Field Marshal commanding, and that, pending his reply, Cronje's laager would not be attacked. Lord

<col>27</col>
Roberts received the message about 10 a.m. the same day, on his arrival at Paardeberg, and gave orders that the armistice could not be granted for the reason given in the despatch.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00266"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: May I ask the right lion. Gentleman whether when Lord Kitchener replied he was actually in command of the British army on that day at Paardeberg?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00267"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: No, Sir; the actual control was in the hands of the senior general officer, who, at that moment, by local rank, was not Lord Kitchener. Lord Kitchener was empowered by Lord Roberts to offer advice if he thought it necessary, and, if he offered such advice, no doubt it was taken by the senior officer on the spot.</membercontribution></p>

<title>MILITARY COURTS OF INQUIRY.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00270"><member>MR. YERBURGH</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary of State for War whether an officer whose conduct forms the subject of a court of inquiry has the right or is afforded the opportunity of appearing in person before such court, and of calling witnesses in his defence; and whether officers of all ranks, against whom steps have been taken by the War Office in consequence of the finding of a court of inquiry before which they have not had the opportunity of appearing, have the right, whether on full or on half-pay, to demand a court-martial; and, if not, whether they have any, and, if so, what right of appeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00271"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: The officer on whom a court of inquiry is held has the right and is afforded the opportunity of appearing before the court. The court of inquiry may report circumstances directly or indirectly affecting other officers, but in such cases the fact that they have not been called is considered in dealing with the finding of the court. No officer has a right of appeal to a court-martial, but to the Commander-in-Chief and the Sovereign, in accordance with Section 42 of the Army Act.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman and the First Lord of the Treasury the other day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00273"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: No promise was given as to the alteration of rules, but certain pledges were given as to the way in which officers were to be treated in certain cases, and these pledges will be adhered to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00274"><member>MR. YERBURGH</member><membercontribution>: What I would like to ask the right lion. Gentleman is, are all officers whose conduct may be the subject of a court of inquiry given the opportunity of appearing before the court?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00275"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: It is impossible to assure the procedure to such a degree that, when the conduct of one officer is under consideration by a court of inquiry, no evidence may be by any chance brought forward which may affect some other officer who may not be present. But should any action be taken on such evidence, or on the report made on it, of course the fact of such officer not being present is taken into account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00276"><member>MR. YERBURGH</member><membercontribution>: I desire to ask the right hon. Gentleman whether where punishment is passed upon an officer in accordance with the result of a court of inquiry that officer is given as a matter of right the opportunity of having his case heard before sentence is passed upon him?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00277"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: I think the hon. Member had better put his question down. I am quite aware of the case to which he refers, and I am prepared, at the proper time, to answer it, but I am not prepared to enter into a debate on this question in the form of a question and answer across the floor of the House. But I may state that the officer to whom the hon. Member refers had had an opportunity of making an explanation, and the substance of his explanation was well known to the officer who made the recommendation in regard to it.</membercontribution></p>

This difficulty has been rendered greater by many of the men arriving unexpectedly after the authorised hours. As the barracks are temporarily occupied by more than the normal number, it has been necessary to provide trestle camp

It is not true that men have been drilled in the snow un-provided with proper clothing or boots. Every man is provided with a warm jersey to wear under his khaki serge frock. As regards the rifles, all demands of the Commandant, Imperial Yeomanry, have been met without any hitch or delay. The Commander-in-Chief has sent General Mackinnon to Aldershot to take command, under Sir Redvers Buller, of the large body of Yeomanry now there.

<p id="S4V0090P0-00317"><member>MR.

No defects have been discovered in the breech mechanism, nor has the recoil proved destructive to the carriages. The threads of some of the breech screws have become burred owing to the guns being used for drill purposes without drill carriages&#x2014;a slight damage which can be repaired locally. Some of the axles of the gun carriages having cracked in travelling, the firm which supplied the batteries is replacing all the axles by axles of an improved pattern at its own expense.

<title>HIRE OF TRANSPORTS FOR THE<lb/> CAPE.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00329"><member>*MR. ALFEED DAVIES</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Admiralty whether he can explain why the Government did not exercise the powers in the subsidy contract with the steamship companies when war was imminent with the late Transvaal Government, and when the ultimatum had been issued and British territory invaded, by taking their fastest steamers for transports which were available, some of which have an average speed of twenty-one to twenty-two knots, and would have done the passage to Cape Town in twelve to fourteen days (the length of passage by ordinary steamers being sixteen days), instead of chartering at that time steamers many of which had an average speed of ten to twelve knots, and took twenty to twenty-eight days for the passage to Cape Town; and whether, Shaving regard to the importance of the arrival of troops eight or twelve days earlier at that critical time, he can state why the following steamers were employed for carrying troops &#x2014; namely, the "Jelunga," which took thirty-six days from Southampton to Durban; the "Harlech Castle," which took twenty-six days from Southampton to Cape Town; the "Manila," which took twenty-six days from Southampton to Cape Town; and the "Zibengla," which took twenty-eight days from Birkenhead to Cape Town.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00330"><member>MR. ARNOLD-FORSTER</member><membercontribution>: It is doubtful whether the Admiralty had power to take up subsidised ships for the purpose of transport, and in any case the Admiralty does not consider it desirable
<col>38</col>
to make a demand upon the steamship companies which would clearly be at variance with the intention of both parties when entering into the contract. The intention of the Admiralty was to obtain the use of these vessels as armed cruisers, and not as transports in a non-maritime war. Many of the steamers on the Admiralty List, especially the Atlantic vessels of very high speed, are not suited for the purpose of Army transport, and would require extensive alterations and refitting to make them available for the purpose. When two of the Atlantic vessels were subsequently engaged (not under the Subsidy Agreements) they took eighteen and nineteen days respectively to reach Cape Town. They are quite unsuited for the conveyance of artillery (for which the first requisition was received) and for cavalry. The "Jelunga" was all ready fitted when requisition for the despatch of troops was received. It was necessary to send her <i>via</i> the Mediterranean and Suez Canal, as the Rifle Brigade, which was one of the regiments selected for South Africa, was stationed at Crete. With regard to the other vessels&#x2014;looking to the necessity in every case of erecting special fittings, it was obviously necessary to take the most suitable ships actually in British ports, a necessity which, of course, limits choice. The "Harlech Castle" and "Manila" each lost four days on their passage through heavy weather. As there were only three weeks in which to prepare transport for 20,000 men, the ships that could be got at once had to be taken to enable it to be done, as it was.</membercontribution></p>

<col>49</col>
the meaning of the statute of Anne 1, stat. 1, c. 8; or. if not, what is the effect of such letters patent; and if such letters patent constitute a new commission, must two justices at least from each county take the judicial oath and the oath of allegiance before the Lord Chancellor or one of His Majesty's judges in order to enable a court of quarter sessions to be formed before which the other justices can take the necessary oaths as required by the Promissory Oaths Act, 1871, or will some person be appointed by His Majesty in accordance with Section 2 of that Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00386"><member>*MR. RITCHIE</member><membercontribution>: I have been in communication with the Lord Chancellor, from whose office the letters patent referred to were issued. The answer to the first and second questions is that the letters patent do not constitute a new commission, and that their effect is not to determine but to continue existing commissions. Consequently the third question does not really arise, but seeing that justices may think it desirable (in accordance with the advice which I stated a few days ago had been given to me) to take the oaths afresh, I am considering whether I shall recommend His Majesty, for the sake of general convenience, to make an appointment under the Promissory Oaths Act. 1871.</membercontribution></p>

Proposals of the kind referred to in these questions were more than once discussed in this House last year in connection with the Bill for the Housing of the Working Classes. It clearly appeared that the sense of the House was adverse to them, and I am not now prepared to propose the legislation which would be necessary for carrying them into effect.

<title>SOUTH AFRICAN MAIL DELAYS.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00421"><member>MR. BARTLEY</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury, as representing the Postmaster General, whether he is aware that the South African mail arrives frequently, as it did this week, on Monday, thus taking nineteen days from Cape Town; whether he is aware that the new mail boats do the voyage in fifteen or sixteen days, thus securing delivery of the letters three and four days earlier; whether, under a recent arrangement, the voyage of the mails was to be done in sixteen days; and whether he will take steps to secure that the mails shall not in future be carried by the old slow boats of the Union Castle Line.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00422"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: On three occasions during this year the South African correspondence has only been delivered in London on Monday, the packet having reached Southampton on two of those occasions on Sunday morning, and on the third, late on Saturday night. On the two occasions of a Sunday arrival the packet exceeded, in adverse circumstances, the time allowed for the voyage under the contract, namely sixteen days twenty hours. A contract time of sixteen days fifteen hours comes into force on the 1st of October, 1903. It is a fact that the voyage has been completed by some of the packets in sixteen and even in fifteen days; but the Postmaster General cannot prevent the
<col>56</col>
use of any particular packet of the Union Castle Line which is not up to that speed, especially if the ships can in normal circumstances do the contract speed. If a vessel incapable of performing the contract were habitually employed, the Postmaster General would, of course, represent the matter to the Colonial Government. The contract is not with the Postmaster General, but with the Government of the Cape Colony. Penalties are prescribed for cases in which the contract time is exceeded.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00440"><member>THE PARLIAMENTARY CHARITY COMMISSIONER (Mr. GRIFFITH BOSCAWEN, <memberconstituency>Kent, Tunbridge</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: With reference to the question in the first paragraph, the Commissioners have no knowledge of the new regulation mentioned in the question beyond what has appeared in the newspapers.

Under the provisions of the

City of London Parochial Charities Act, 1883, the sum representing Dowe's gift, which amounts to &#x00A3;1 6s. 8d. a year, was scheduled as an ecclesiastical charity, and freed from all previously existing trusts, and by a scheme established under this Act it became part of the City Church Fund, the balance of which, after providing for various City church purposes, is paid to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners.

<p id="S4V0090P0-00442"><member>MR. GRIFFITH BOSCAWEN</member><membercontribution>: There is in the recently established scheme for St. Cross a provision giving to the town council of Winchester the nomination of one of the trustees. But the scheme in question is not a new scheme in the sense that it reorganises the charity. It is in the main a scheme consolidating the provisions of previous orders of the Court of Chancery and of the Charity Commissioners. There is such a restriction in the scheme as that mentioned in the second part of the hon. Member's question. The restriction is in accordance with the provision made by the Court of Chancery in 1857, that the mayor of Winchester should be a trustee if a member of the Church of England. In answer to the third part of the question, there are many recent precedents for requiring in schemes that representative

<p id="S4V0090P0-00451"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The eviction of Allison was carried out on the 6th instant in pursuance of a magistrate's warrant for possession. At the hearing of the case a statement was made on behalf of the tenant to the effect mentioned in the third paragraph; the statement, however, was not proved. After eviction, a sum of &#x00A3;50 was offered to Allison by the agent, but was rejected. I am informed that Allison was carried out of the house in his bed.

reported accordingly to the Local Government Board; and whether the Local Government Board will order an inquiry by their inspector into the representations lodged in May, 1899, and order the district council to promulgate a scheme which will include cottages for those labourers whose representations are so long pending.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00472"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The facts are generally as stated. It appears that the district council received representations for the erection of twenty-four labourers' cottages, but they decided to make a scheme for eleven only, as that was the number of applicants' dwellings which the medical officer of health actually condemned as unfit for human habitation. The scheme so made is being confirmed by Provisional Order, and it appears from recent minutes of the district council that they are considering further representations with the view of making a supplemental scheme. The effect of an inquiry such as that asked for would be to coerce the council to act on particular applications, but as that body seems to be exercising a reasonable discretion in the matter, the Board do not think there is any cause for interference on their part.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00473"><member>MR. O'DOHERTY</member><membercontribution>: What was the reason for the rejection of the scheme?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00474"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The district council put forward a scheme affecting a number of houses which had been condemned by the medical officer.

<title>RENT FIXTURES.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00475"><member>COLONEL M'CALMONT</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland will he state what is the number of cases in which rents have been fixed by the Land Commission or by agreement in Ireland; and how many cases in which orders have been made under Section 19, Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, directing cottages to be built or improved; in how many of these cases have the orders been complied with; and in how many cases have the penalties for non-compliance with orders been enforced.</membercontribution></p>
<col>68</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00476"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The number of fair rents fixed by the Land Commission has been, for a first statutory term, 174,849; for a second term, 34,367. The number fixed by agreements and declarations lodged with the Commission has been, for a first statutory term, 132,051; for a second term, 27,777. Fair rents have also been fixed in the civil bill courts for a first statutory term in 18,477 cases, and for a second term in 2,492 cases; and by agreements in the same courts, for a first term in 7,329, and for a second term in 146 cases. The number of orders made by the Land Commission under the enactment referred to in the second paragraph is 853. I am unable to say, without further inquiry, in how many cases these orders have been complied with. The duty of enforcing compliance with the order devolves primarily upon the sanitary authority, and it is only in cases where complaint is made to the Local Government Board by householders in the district that the Board act in lieu of the sanitary authority. Only one such case has so far occurred, and in that the Board took proceedings and enforced the penalty.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00492"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The position in reference to the payment of the grant in aid of the maintenance of pauper lunatics for the period mentioned has repeatedly been explained, both in answer to questions in this House and in communications addressed by Government to the local authorities. It is erroneous to assume that these authorities have been deprived of any portion of the grant by reason of the change in the year of account. It is true that the expenditure during the quarter ended 31st March, 1899, does not form an element in the calculation of the grant for 1900&#x2013;1, but in lieu of it the somewhat greater expenditure for the corresponding quarter of 1900 has been taken, and the local authorities have thus received for this year, as heretofore, a full year's grant.</membercontribution></p>

<col>71</col>
the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been directed to the deportation of a woman named M'Cabe from Glasgow to Nenagh (Ireland); whether he is aware that it appears from the depositions of Mrs. M'Cabe, that she left Ireland when eight years old and went to England where she resided fifty-two years, then went to Scotland when, after a residence of four weeks in a workhouse in Glasgow, she was sent to Nenagh; and whether the authorities connected with the Glasgow Workhouse are empowered to take such action; and, if so, whether he will cause the law to be amended to prevent a repetition of similar action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00496"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: I am informed that the facts are correctly stated in the question. The Local Government Board for Scotland have informed the Guardians that the Parish Council of Glasgow were acting within their legal rights in removing this poor person, and that she did not reside in Glasgow sufficiently long to confer upon the Irish Board of Guardians a right of appeal against her removal. The case is doubtless one of hardship, but I am afraid I can hold out no hope of an amendment of the law, as suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00497"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution>: Why was this woman, who lived fifty-two years in England, not sent there instead of to Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00498"><member>MR.

Hence this poor woman was not sent to England.</membercontribution></p>

This indulgence is given to tenants on many estates in Ireland, but I have no means of ascertaining whether it is demanded when the tenant enters the courts as suggested.

<p id="S4V0090P0-00553"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: There appears to be some misapprehension in this case. The scale of pay for sorting clerks and telegraphists on appointment at Enniskillen, sanctioned by the Treasury in 1890, was the same as at all other offices of a similar class&#x2014; namely, 12s. the first year. 14s. the second year, and 18s. the third year, and then rising by 2s. per week annually to the maximum. It appears, however, that two officers, who are probably those referred to, did not enter the scale at 12s.
<image src="S4V0090P0I0159"/>
<col>83</col>
per week, but, in pursuance of further authority obtained in 1891, granting a concession to officers who had rendered unestablished service of not less than a year and had attained certain qualifications, wore allowed to enter the scale at 14s. a week; and in their case the pay was, as laid down in the authority, 16s. a week for the second year, and 18s. a week for the third year; so that instead of receiving 12s. a week for the first year, 14s. a week for the second year, and 18s. a week the for third year, they received 14s. a week for the first year, l6s.a week for the second year, and 18s. a week for the third year. Another officer, appointed in 1892, with longer unestablished service, was, in accordance with the same authority, allowed to enter the scale at 10s. a week, receiving 18s. a week for the second year, then rising by 2s. per week annually.</membercontribution></p>

<title>ILLEGAL PRACTICES IN THE CHURCH<lb/> OF ENGLAND.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00570"><member>MR. CHARLES MARTHUR <memberconstituency>(Liverpool, Exchange)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the First Lord of the Treasury whether his attention has been directed to the continued resort by a section of the clergy of the Established Church to practices not prescribed by the Book of Common Prayer or ordered by lawful authority, such as. masses, celebration of Holy Communion without the requisite number of communicants, children's Eucharists, ceremonial use of incense, and the inculcation of habitual confession; whether he is aware that the bishops continue to veto legal proceedings intended to check such irregularities; whether the laity in large numbers are thus deprived of their constitutional right to the ministrations of religion in their parish churches in
<image src="S4V0090P0I0161"/>
<col>87</col>
accordance with the rites of the Church of England, and that disturbances in Divine worship have been occasioned in connection with these irregularities; and whether he will consider the desirability of carrying into effect the Resolution of the House of Commons on 10th May, 1899, that if the efforts now being made by the archbishops and bishops to secure the due obedience of the clergy are not speedily effectual, further legislation will be required to maintain the observance of the existing laws of Church and Realm.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00571"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: As my hon. friend is aware, I have no official cognisance of the matters referred to in the first three paragraphs of the question. He must therefore take my answer as conveying my own personal views for what they are worth. I hope, and believe, that the efforts of the bishops have had, and are having, a great effect in diminishing practices in the Church of England which are unlawful or inexpedient. I have heard of no employment of the veto by any bishop except in the case of Colonel Porcelli, who was not a parishioner of any of the churches of which he complained, nor did he represent any responsible body or association in the country. I ought to add that my hon friends enumeration of the unlawful practices he desires to see dealt with is somewhat misleading. He enumerates five practices which he implies are contrary to the law. The first of these is Masses. If he means to describe the Communion Service of the Church of England by the word "Mass," it seems to me to be a misleading and foolish expression. But it is not illegal. As to the second point, the celebration of the Holy Communion without the requisite number of communicants is undoubtedly illegal; but I have no ground for thinking it is otherwise than of rare occurrence, and when it happens it is often by accident. The third point is children's Eucharists. If this means, as I suppose it does, the presence of children during the Communion Service, it seems to me to be a very undesirable practice, but it cannot be described as unlawful. I may add that it has been frequently objected to by the bishops. The ceremonial use of incense is undoubt-
<col>88</col>
edly illegal, but I believe the practice has greatly diminished, and is diminishing, through the action of the bishops. As to the fifth point, the inculcation of habitual confession is, wherever it takes place, a most unfortunate practice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00572"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: This is a speech, and a very offensive one. On a point of order I desire to ask whether the First Lord of the Treasury is in order in delivering a long speech giving his opinion on controversial matters to which hon. Members are not at liberty to reply.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00573"><member>*MR. SPEAKER</member><membercontribution>: I must say I think the fault, if any, is rather of the questioner than the answerer. The question enters into matters of opinion which, if I had seen it, I should not have allowed to appear on the Paper. The first part of the question does refer to these practices as illegal, and I cannot say the right hon. Gentleman is out of order in offering his opinion whether they are illegal or otherwise. He is speaking, not of the merits of the practices, but strictly to the question whether they are in accordance with the law of the Church of England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00574"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: If the hon. Gentleman supposes I was making any reflection on observances in the Church of which he is a member he is mistaken. I was referring only to the Church of England, and to practices as they are regarded by the Protestant community. To make confession a condition of receiving Communion is not only repugnant to the whole spirit of the Church of England, but is wholly illegal. I do not think the imposition of such a condition has been attempted, and if it were it would not receive a moment's toleration from any member of the episcopal bench.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00601">1. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;5,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, for the Houses of Parliament Buildings."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00602"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I have long been waiting for this opportunity, and I hope the question I am about to raise will not be debated upon party lines. I allude to the necessity of providing for the Members of this House a new and a more airy smoking place. Those of us who make a practice of attending steadily and regularly to our duties in this House have been long groaning under an intolerable grievance in the shape of the present smoking-room accommodation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00603"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: How does the hon. Member propose to raise such a discussion upon this Vote?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00604"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: IT is for the cost of certain alterations in the House of Commons</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00605"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: But these alterations do not relate to the smoke-room.</membercontribution></p>
<col>92</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00606"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: My point is that they ought to relate to the smoke-room.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00607"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The discussion must be confined to the matters dealt with in this Supplementary Estimate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00608"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: How are we to know what is included? The items are not set forth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00609"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: If the hon. Member will look on page 4 he will see them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00610"><member>MR. LOUGH <memberconstituency>(Islington, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: This Vote relates to the new rooms which have been placed at the disposal of the House, and I ask therefore is it not in order to discuss to what use they should be put?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00611"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: It is obvious that there is no relation between the late clerk's residence and the provision of a smoking-room.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00612"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: Would those rooms not enable us to have another smoking room?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00613"><member>MR. FLYNN <memberconstituency>(Cork, N)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The present smoke-room was changed not long ago, and I believe the alteration is a portion of the expense in connection with this Vote. It will be remembered that the smoke-room has quite recently been removed to the other side of the corridor, and the present room is a very great inconvenience to the majority of the Members of this House</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00614"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member, to bring himself in order, must show that the late residence of the Chief Clerk ought to have been converted, or might have been converted, into a smoking-room. If he can show that, then he will be in order in discussing that, but if he is suggesting that other rooms should be devoted to a smoke-room, or that the accommodation of the present smoke-room ought to be improved, then he is not in order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00615"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: I confess that I did not think you would draw the rule so close as to say that it should be a room in the residence of the late Chief Clerk. Of course, I can argue my point upon that as well as if it
<image src="S4V0090P0I0164"/>
<col>93</col>
were any other room in the House. This Vote provides some fresh accommodation for the members of the press, and for the warming and ventilating of a portion of the House. My contention is that the present smoking-room is not sufficient accommodation for the Members of the House who frequent it, and I do think that it is a monstrous thing that in the House of Commons we cannot have decent accommodation in the smoke-room and the dining-room. I would prefer to take the new smoke-room from the House of Lords, but I can see that I cannot argue in favour of that proposal under your present riding. My primary object is to get this accommodation wherever we can, and I am quite ready to accept an additional room if the First Commissioner of Works can offer one of those which belonged to the residence of the late Chief Clerk. What are the conditions to which we are subjected? In the first place the room is not large enough, and I myself and other hon. Members have gone and found it impossible to get in, the room being so crowded, and the atmosphere absolutely unhealthy, and calculated to make one weary and ill, instead of making Members refreshed to return to business in the House. Not only is that the case, but the present smoking-room is situated over the kitchen or some other subterranean place where fires are kept up in the summer time. It looks into a closed yard in which there is no free circulation of fresh air, the consequence of which is that when summer comes it is absolutely intolerable, and I have seen the thermometer there standing at 90 degrees day after day, so that it was, practically speaking, uninhabitable. I think that that is a condition of things which the Members of the House of Commons ought not to be subjected to. At all events, if we are to have no other smoking-room accommodation except the present room, then I would ask that some attempt should be made, by a system of ventilation, to relieve the vitiated atmosphere of the room.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00616"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member is not confining himself to the subject. The house of the late clerk is the point to which the hon. Member must confine himself.</membercontribution></p>
<col>94</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00617"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER of WORKS (MR. AKERS DOUGLAS, <memberconstituency>Kent, St. Augustine's</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps it will shorten the debate upon this subject if I state now what the Government propose to do, and it may save a good deal of time. I fully admit the inadequacy of the present smoking-room accommodation, and it has been my earnest endeavour to improve the ventilation of that spot. Owing to the vacation of the late clerk's residence we have been able to make a different allocation of the rooms, and at the present moment there are some four or five rooms which have not been allocated on the Terrace front. I had intended to ask the House at the commencement of this session to reappoint the House of Commons Accommodation Committee, so that they might make some recommendations upon this point. Besides further smoking-room accommodation, some hon. Members opposite require further accommodation for their private secretaries and for typewriting, and it has always been the practice of this House, that whenever structural alterations of the building take place, this should only be done upon the Report of a Committee of this House. I did not see fit last autumn to make these alterations, because I intended to move for the re-appointment of this Committee for that purpose. It is quite possible to make a decent smoking-room on the site to which I have alluded. I am not certain that it would be adequate for the large number of hon. Members who use the smoking-room, but, at all events, it would be a great improvement on the existing room, and not being over the kitchen, would he free from the smells of which the hon. Member complains, as it would be possible to ventilate it thoroughly. I will do my best to: provide this extra accommodation. In regard to the other small requirements of the House, I think these had better be left to the Committee, and if the hon. Member is satisfied with my explanation I will put down a notice for the appointment of the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00618"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: I rise simply to convey my grateful thanks to the right hon. Gentleman. Nothing could have been more satisfactory than his statement.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0165"/>
<col>95</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00619"><member>MR. WILLIAM REDMOND <memberconstituency>(Clare, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked if an additional smoking could not be provided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00620"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: That is a point to which the attention of the Committee will be directed. Of course Ave shall be guided by the recommendations of the Committee, and we had better wait until it reports.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00621"><member>MR. WILLIAM REDMOND</member><membercontribution>: When will you appoint the Committee?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00622"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: I will put it down on the Paper as soon as I can.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00623"><member>COLONEL WELBY <memberconstituency>(Taunton)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said they all knew the condition of many parts of the House on a hot July day, and he would make a suggestion as to the ventilation of the lobbies&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00624"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: No question arises on the lobbies,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00625"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution> thought that the statement of the right hon. Gentleman in regard to the appointment of a Committee was quite satisfactory, and it would be more convenient for hon. Members to bring any suggestions they had to make before the Committee rather than discuss them there. A reference was made in the Estimates to ventilation. Members had suffered greatly from the thoroughly bad ventilation of the big Committee rooms upstairs. He understood that experiments were promised a long time ago with the object of determining whether the ventilation of these rooms could be improved. He did not know whether this would come within the scope of the reference to the Committee, but he would ask whether the right hon. Gentleman could not adopt some of the simple expedients now common in other places&#x2014;such as electric fans&#x2014; so as to make the ventilation quite right. There was also a reference in the Vote to the increased cost of fuel. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could give some information on the point which might be interesting to the House, for other people had suffered from the increased price of coal. Would the right hon. Gentleman say what the Government were doing in the pur-
<col>96</col>
chase of fuel, and whether the price was going down, so that this difficulty might soon disappear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00626"><member>MR. FLYNN</member><membercontribution> said he wanted some-information in regard to the item under the heading D,&#x2014;"Cost of furniture I etc., in connection with the opening of Parliament by the King in person." He objected to this Vote <i>in toto,</i> not because the King had opened Parliament in person, but because the whole of the arrangements had been most unsatisfactory and most undignified. He would like to know what that additional furniture was and where it was-placed. He had never seen any of it. The sum&#x2014;&#x00A3;800&#x2014;was not very great, but the principle involved in this Vote was important. The House had to find the money for these ceremonies, but hon. Members were deprived of any accommodation to witness them except that which they would not give a lackey. He himself had taken no part in the proceedings, because he had a distaste for ceremonials of that kind, but he had been assured by hon. Members who were there that the only accommodation they could get enabled them to gain a peep view over their neighbour's shoulders. In fact, they had no more opportunity of catching sight of the King and Queen than a man in a theatre had of securing a view of the stage if he sat behind a lady wearing a tall feathered hat. The result was that hon. Members had suffered considerable pain of mind and body. He had great sympathy with hon. Members on both sides of the House who had been engaged in the discreditable football rush towards the-bar of the other House, and who, when they got there, could not even see their Majesties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00627"><member>SIR BRAMPTON GURDON <memberconstituency>(Norfolk, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he had placed on the Notice Paper a motion to reduce this Vote by the sum of &#x00A3;1,300. He would not have done so if it had really been the opening of Parliament for which they were asked to pay the reasonable expenses. But it was not the opening of Parliament, but the opening of an assembly of ladies and friends of the Lord Great Chamberlain; and it was
<image src="S4V0090P0I0166"/>
<col>97</col>
too much to ask the British taxpayer to pay the expenses, at this time, of such a ceremony. He believed that the people who went to see this show and who had no constitutional right or necessity to be there, should pay the expenses, just as they would pay for seats at the opera or theatre. A great constitutional question was involved in this Vote, because if Parliament was to be opened by the Sovereign in person, and if the King was to deliver his gracious Speech from the Throne to the Lords and his faithful Commons, the Commons ought to be there, and it was for them that room ought to be supplied. He was not making any attack upon the right hon. Gentleman opposite. He knew it was not the right hon. Gentleman's fault, and that the matter was entirely in the hands of the Lord Great Chamberlain. He spoke not only for Members of that House, but also for Members of the other House, who had been worse treated even than the Commons were, and had been deprived of their usual seats. It was most important that the House should show that they meant to be as loyal and faithful to His Majesty the King as they were to the late Queen; but if they passed this Vote it was as much as saying that they did not value the privilege of access to His Majesty, and that they did not care to hear his gracious Speech from the Throne. He thought that, having been prevented from obeying the first command given to them by His Majesty after his accession, they should make this protest; and he hoped hon. Members would take that, the only opportunity they had, of testifying their loyalty to His Majesty by refusing to vote this sum. He moved that the Vote be reduced by the sum of &#x00A3;1,300.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00628">Motion made and Question proposed, "That a sum not exceeding &#x00A3;3,700 be granted for the said Service."&#x2014; (<i>Sir Brampton Gurdon.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00629"><member>*COLONEL NOLAN <memberconstituency>(Galway, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he might fairly support the Amendment for the reasons given by the hon. Member. He had not been in the crush, but everything had been done to put hon. Members in a position in which they were very
<col>98</col>
likely to be crushed. When he got to the House of Lords he had a view of several very handsome peeresses, very prettily dressed, but he saw very little else, and had only a peep at His Gracious Majesty. But he had a much more serious reason for moving the reduction of this Vote, as he had intended doing. He thought that it would have been far better if the King had not come to open Parliament on that occasion, and the &#x00A3;1,300 would have been saved. Her late Majesty, when she came to open Parliament, was fulfilling a very important part of the Constitution, and therefore she was to be encouraged in doing so; but on this special occasion the King ought not to have come, and his reason for saying so was that he wished His Majesty had put off making the Declaration calling him an idolater.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00630"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: Order, order&#x0021; That has nothing to do with the Vote before the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00631"><member>*COLONEL NOLAN</member><membercontribution> said he might not be allowed to argue the question, but he could not be compelled to vote &#x00A3;1,300 to pay the expenses of His Majesty coming. as was alleged, to open Parliament. He did not blame the King. He knew that whatever His Majesty said, he was advised to say by his responsible Ministers. If he was not allowed to give the reasons for the vote he was going to record, everyone should know why he objected to the Supplementary Estimate asked for. Not only every Roman Catholic Member, but every enlightened Protestant ought to join in the endeavour to cut it down.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00632"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE <memberconstituency>(Northampton)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that all this bother in the House of Commons was. as usual, due to an hereditary gentleman&#x2014;the Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain. He was perfectly convinced that if the matter had been left in the hands of the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works, the House of Commons would not have been treated in the fashion it had been, and that hon. Members would have had allocated to them a fair space in the House of Lords when His Majesty came to deliver his gracious Speech from the Throne. He would like some-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0167"/>
<col>99</col>
one to explain how far the functions of this hereditary gentleman&#x2014;the Hereditary Lord Great Chamberlain&#x2014;went. He had an objection to vote anything as long as that gentleman had the disposal, in any sort of way, direct or indirect, of the funds voted by the House of Commons. He believed that there was a time when this Hereditary Great Chamberlain exercised a jurisdiction over all the palaces in the country; but, by degrees, he had been disestablished in every palace except that of Westminster. He really thought it was full time that they should claim that the Palace of Westminster, being the seat of the Legislature of the country, should be in the hands of some responsible Minister, like the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works. He would point out that the Hereditary Great Chamberlain was a peer, and looked after his own friends &#x2014; especially the peeresses. He (Mr. Labouchere) was as fond of a show as anyone else, but he had had no opportunity of seeing this one. Surely, if it became a question as to whether peeresses or the Members of the House had the privilege of witnessing the show, representatives of the Commons, who were a component part of the Legislature, had the first call in regard to space. He hoped the right hon. Gentleman would take some steps to take the control of the Palace of Westminster out of the jurisdiction of the Lord High Chamberlain, and place it in the control of a responsible Minister.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00633"><member>*MR. JOHN ELLIS <memberconstituency>(Nottinghamshire, Rushcliffe)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> expressed a hope that the right hon. Gentleman who asked for the Vote would take notice that what had been said was a faint echo of the widespread dissatisfaction that existed in regard to this matter. On the occasion of the opening of Parliament hon. Members endeavoured to squeeze themselves into a place which could not accommodate them, and the arrangements made were such as to mar the dignity and decorum which everyone desired should permeate such an occasion. He did not look at the matter from a spectacular but a constitutional point of view. The Sovereign, the Crown, the Lords, and the Commons were the component parts of Parliament, and it was the King's command which
<col>100</col>
took hon. Members to the other House; and, putting the spectacular aspect of the matter on one side, the only proper way in which the King's command could be obeyed was for proper accommodation to be made for the Commons to assemble in the House of Lords, as was desired-He had been shocked to see the way in which the House of Lords had been transformed. If the Lords cared to have. their benches put up and stacked away and narrow wooden benches erected for themselves and their peeresses, certainly he did not object. But outside the space of the actual technical House of Lords the Commons had the first claim. He would like to know why Members were deprived of the possibility of going into the galleries in the House of Lords which were reserved for them, especially when those galleries were not fully occupied. The-only remedy for preventing a recurrence of the unseemly spectacle which was: witnessed on this occasion was that steps should be taken&#x2014;and they could be taken at the beginning of a new reign, for of course the Crown was above precedent as regards its own high officials &#x2014;to put the Lord Great Chamberlain in his proper place in these matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00634"><member>MAJOR JAMESON <memberconstituency>(Clare, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> also protested against the arrangements which were made for the reception of the House1 of Commons when they started to obey the King. Many reasons had been given: to show that the First Commissioner of Works was not to blame, but he considered that that Gentleman was entirely to blame. In the unseemly crush which took place when the House was summoned to hear the Speech from the-Throne, he had been content to put up with the loss of a hat, but one hon. Member had been so injured that he had never been out of bed since. Until the House received some kind of apology from the right hon. Gentleman for what had occurred, when he knew, under the circumstances, that all Members of the House would like to attend, he should consider he was to blame for not making arrangements with the Lord Great Chamberlain on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00635"><member>*MR. STEVENSON <memberconstituency>(Suffolk, Eye)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> was glad that this opportunity had been, taken for adequately expressing the wide-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0168"/>
<col>101</col>
spread feeling of dissatisfaction which prevailed on this subject. A short time since he had put a question to the First Lord of the Treasury as to the advisability of appointing a Committee to consider the comparative merits of Westminster Hall as a place where Parliament might be convened. The proceedings on the opening day marked a complete divergence of the theory and the practice of Parliament, and they were, in so far as the House of Commons was concerned, a positive scandal. Until the reign of Henry VII., and possibly on some subsequent occasions, the opening of Parliament took place in the Painted Chamber, the Lords sitting on the one side and the Commons on the other; and at this date, when the Painted Chamber was no longer in existence, the chamber which most closely approximated was Westminster Hall. The cost of utilising what was acknowledged to be the grandest hall in England would not greatly exceed the cost at present involved in opening Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00636"><member>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE <memberconstituency>(Wexford, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it appeared to him that in this particular case the House of Commons was in the same position as an Irish county council in connection with the court-houses in Ireland. They built and maintained the court-houses, yet those court-houses were not in their control, but in the control of the High Sheriff. In this ease the House of Commons paid the money, and the control was in the Lord Great Chamberlain. He should certainly go into the lobby against the Vote asked for. He intended to vote against the proposal as an expression of his feeling in connection with the proceedings at the opening of Parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00637"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: I am not at all surprised at the dissatisfaction which has been expressed by the Committee with regard to the arrangements made at the opening of Parliament. As many hon. Members on the other side of the House were kind enough to say, those arrangements were not in my hands or in the hands of the Government. It has always been my wish on these occasions to represent in the proper quarter that accommodation of a suitable character should be found for the House
<col>102</col>
of Commons. But so far as I am concerned, I have no power in this matter to act for the House of Commons. With regard to the particular question and the jurisdiction of the Lord Great Chamberlain, I venture to offer the protest that this is hardly the opportunity when complaints in regard to that distinguished officer can be made. All we are asked on the present occasion to do is to vote a sum of money with regard to certain arrangements made for the opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, arrangements made not by the Great Chamberlain's office, but by the Department I represent. I hope I shall be able to justify that expenditure and show, if pressed, that the actual amount of money spent has been represented by the goods provided. But with regard to the general question of the convenience of Members on that occasion. I would point out that I recognise that the House of Commons is properly dissatisfied with the arrangements then made, but I think that that dissatisfaction is general not only to the House of Commons, but to the other House and to the public at large. I am quite sure that there is no one in this country more anxious to provide proper accommodation for his faithful Commons than His Majesty the King. With regard to Westminster Hall, the hon. Member who has just sat down has made an appeal to me, and although I agree with him as to the suitability of the building, I wish to put on record a protest with regard to the expenditure likely to be incurred. I should like to guard myself in that maattr, because undoubtedly the expenses would be considerable in providing accommodation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00638"><member>*MR. STEVENSON</member><membercontribution>: My only point with regard to expenditure is that Westminster Hall would require little decoration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00639"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: With regard to decoration, yes; but with regard to stands and other things I may tell the hon. Member that I have taken pains to go into the figures, and to get these things would involve considerable expenditure, but I do not think there need be a difficulty; if both Houses are agreed and if the King is pleased to agree in making the necessary alterations.
<image src="S4V0090P0I0169"/>
<col>103</col>
May I point out that not only did we recognise that the accommodation at present is unsatisfactory, but that we have at once met the appeals made to us from both sides of the House to find some remedy, and my right hon. friend the Leader of the House at once consented to the appointment of a committee to take into consideration not only the accommodation available in the House of Lords, but also the advisability of substituting Westminster Hall for use on similar occasions? That motion has been on the Paper two or three nights, and it is only owing to the action of hon. Members from Ireland who complain of the general arrangements on that occation that that motion has not received the approval of the House of Commons. I hope that the motion may be carried to-day, especially after the discussion we have had. Before that committee the whole of the subject can be raised in a much fuller way, with all the materials required before it, than can be the case on the present occasion. I trust, in view of the anxiety expressed by the (government to meet the views of Members on both sides, the Committee will not only agree to the expenditure which has been incurred for the opening of Parliament this year, but also allow us to proceed with the motion to-night for the committee to inquire into the providing of proper accommodation on a future occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00640"><member>MR. DALZIEL <memberconstituency>(Kirkcaldy Burghs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> thought the House would recognise the very sympathetic reply of the right hon. Gentleman. He was sure they were all agreed that if the arrangements had been in his hands the state of things that existed would not have occurred. The right hon. Gentleman had told them that this was not the occasion to raise this point. The hon. Member would like to know when the occasion would arise. This gentleman's salary did not come up on the Estimates, and they had practically no other occasion whatever for raising the question. It appeared to him that if they were dissatisfied at the insult offered to the House of Commons it was the duty of the House to refuse to vote this money, as a protest against the system. If the individual responsible for what had happened had brains he ought to have
<col>104</col>
foreseen the state of things. He himself did not attempt to get into that portion of the House of Lords which was allocated to Members of the House of Commons on that particular day. The individual responsible must have known that the House of Commons would be summoned to the House of Lords, and if he had only calculated the space required he would have come to the conclusion that it was impossible to have his own particular friends and the peeresses present on that occasion. There was another matter, and that was the ridiculous arrangements made for the press on that occasion. The accommodation for the press was materially limited, in fact only comparatively few selected newspapers were represented, and many important journals in the country were unable to have their representatives there. In fact, in his opinion, they were treated in the most contemptuous way by the individual responsible. That was a state of things which deserved severe condemnation, and showed utter incapacity on the part of the person responsible. There were persons in the House of Lords that day who had no more claim to be there than the man in the street. It seemed to him to be part of the general policy pursued in reference to recent processions and other things. If it were in order to discuss them now he should say something of the arrangements made on the occasion of her late Majesty's funeral, but it was impossible to enter upon that matter now. It showed to him that there was a feeling practically of contempt with regard to that House on the part of the individual responsible, for this treatment was continued. This official seemed to think that he might pursue that course, because the House of Commons did not vote his salary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00641"><member>SIR E. ASHMEAD-BARTLETT <memberconstituency>(Sheffield, Ecclesall)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said everyone who experienced the inconvenience arising from the arrangements made for the opening of Parliament must feel that there was great neglect of the interests of that House, but he was not at all sure that they were fair in laying all responsibility, or indeed any very large share of it, on the Lord Great Chamberlain. No doubt these affairs were governed by precedent. He thought there was great want of a
<image src="S4V0090P0I0170"/>
<col>105</col>
sense of responsibility on the part of the Government to see that the House of Commons was properly looked after on the occasion. The right hon. Gentleman said he was not responsible. What he wanted to know was, which member of the Government &#x2014;there were twenty of them&#x2014;was responsible for seeing that the House of Commons was treated with ordinary decorum? The hon. Member for the Kirkcaldy Burghs had referred to the want of arrangement on the occasion of Her late Majesty's funeral. That want was most deplorable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00642"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: That matter cannot be raised on this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00643"><member>SIR E. ASHMEAD-BARTLETT</member><membercontribution>: Quite so. He would say no more about it. He only referred to it, not to argue the matter, hut as an illustration of the necessity for some new arrangement being made in the interests of the House of Commons. He suggested that either some special official should be appointed to look after the interests of the House of Commons, or that the Government should distinctly depute his right hon. friend the First Commissioner of Works to deal with this question. Then no doubt they would have all the arrangements satisfactory. He was quite certain that there was no person in the realm who would regret the want of proper accommodation for Members of the House of Commons more than His Majesty himself. He thought if proper representations had been made to him by someone, the interests of the House of Commons would have been better looked after.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00644"><member>MR. DALY <memberconstituency>(Monaghan, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the interest of the Nationalist Members in this question had reference to the money involved. He had no sympathy at all with hon. Members who got jostled in the rush to the House of Lords. He thought those who were crushed deserved all they got on the occasion. He rose to ask the right hon. Gentleman a question with regard to the new smoke-room.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00645"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution> said it would not be in order to raise that matter on this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00646"><member>MR. HEYWOOD JOHNSTONE <memberconstituency>Sussex, Horsham)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he was very
<col>106</col>
glad that, on the occasion referred to, the side galleries, usually available in the House of Lords for Members of the House of Commons, were not open to them. If they had been he was quite certain that a larger number would have shared in the discomforts of the occasion. He did not think that any of the Members who had spoken had grappled with the real difficulty of this question. It was not to be solved by making the office of Lord Great Chamberlain an elective one, or by any method of that sort. The real difficulty was to get the quart of the House of Commons into the pint of the House of Lords. The House of Commons could not attend His Majesty as a whole, and it would be well to consider whether some small number of Members should not be selected to represent the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00647"><member>MR. BARLEY <memberconstituency>(Derbyshire, Chesterfield)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he would vote for the reduction of this Vote. The Government had proposed a Committee to deal with this subject, but the Committee would have no legal right to go to the Lord Great Chamberlain and ask him to do anything on their behalf. If the House had the moral courage to protect its own dignity and constitutional rights in connection with the granting of money when they were treated as they had been, things would be managed differently on such occasions. He would support the Government and the Committee in the action they were taking.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00648"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he should be sorry to allow it to be supposed that the Irish Members had any grievance in not getting into the House of Lords. They had not the slightest desire to enter the House of Lords, and they watched with amusement and surprise the degradation of others of the House. If the Members of the House had any proper sense of their own dignity they would let these high and mighty persons know that if they were going to treat them with contempt they must put their hands into their own breeches pockets. If the House of Commons refused to pay the bill, ample accommodation would be forthcoming on the next occasion. He heartily agreed with the sentiment expressed by one hon. Member who said that on the occasion referred to they had been treated as they deserved to be. He had never attended any of these
<image src="S4V0090P0I0171"/>
<col>107</col>
ceremonials, but during the time he had been in the House he had seen Members come there after great ceremonials weeping, lamenting, and bewailing the gross insults with which they had been treated. On one occasion they went in procession through Victoria Street to present congratulations to the Queen in connection with the Jubilee, and they were practically kicked downstairs, and he found the House of Commons literally boiling with indignation over the treatment to which they had been subjected. That had been repeated over and over again, and until the House of Commons did some specific act different from grumblings and growlings, and showed that they were not going to submit to that treatment, they would be treated in the same way. They had a simple way of stopping it if they chose, and that was by stopping the supplies. Let it be known that if they were going to carry on ceremonials at the public expense they must treat the House of Commons with civility, and that otherwise the House of Lords could raise a subscription for these entertainments. He thought they would then find that the Lord Great Chamberlain would become civil to the House of Commons. The right hon. Gentleman opposite had on these occasions done his best for the House of Commons. He trusted sincerely that if they passed the Vote they would get kicked out as before.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00649"><member>MR. PATRICK O'BRIEN <memberconstituency>(Kilkenny)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he rose to call attention to the accommodation provided in the press gallery of the House of Commons. He was not sure that it was in order to do so under this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00650"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution> said the Amendment which had been moved related solely to the provision for the opening of Parliament, and the debate must be confined to that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00651"><member>MR. PATRICK O'BRIEN</member><membercontribution> gave notice that on another occasion he would call attention to the fact that, in his opinion, there was not proper accommodation in the press gallery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00652"><member>MR. JORDAN <memberconstituency>(Fermanagh, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said there were no details given of the expenditure, and they were absolutely
<col>108</col>
in the dark as to what the money was asked for. They did not know whether they had got fair value for the money or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00653"><member>MR. O'DOHERTY <memberconstituency>(Donegal, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the remark made by the hon. Member for South Fermanagh showed the Ulster keenness about pounds, shillings, and pence. As an Irish Member he had no fault to find with the accommodation provided at the opening of Parliament, but ho suggested that in connection with the Coronation ceremony a few hundred pounds should be spent in providing ambulances for Members of the House who at risk of life and limb attempted to attend. Moreover, it would be as well that Irish Catholic Members should not be asked to go to the House of Lords on such occasions to hear their religion insulted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00654"><member>SIR BRAMPTON GURDON</member><membercontribution> thought that to go to a division was the only means the House had of apologising to the King for not obeying his command. Furthermore, as the hon. Member for Rushcliffe Division had truly said, if the Lord Great Chamberlain had removed the benches from the House of Commons, that House would very soon have wanted to know the reason why. The Lords, however, have no constitutional privileges in this way, and so were obliged to suffer. The House of Commons, therefore, should have some feeling for the House of Lords, and help them where they could not help themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00655"><member>MR. FIELD <memberconstituency>(Dublin, St. Patrick's)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> would not have intervened but for the remarks of a previous speaker. Being an Irish Member he had no desire to assist in the House of Lords at the opening of Parliament, especially when the King used an Oath which in the opinion of Catholics was blasphemous&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00656"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: Order, order&#x0021; I have already pointed out more than once that the matter is not one to be discussed on this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00657"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution> did not propose to discuss the matter further than to say that as an Irish Member&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00658"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member is not entitled to say anything further
<image src="S4V0090P0I0172"/>
<col>109</col>
after I have told him it would be disorderly to refer to the matter. He really must not go on with the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00659"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution> said that while the Irish Members had no desire to go into the House of Lords, they insisted on sufficient accommodation being provided for Members of the House of Commons. He could not understand why an invitation should be given if no accommodation was provided. If the noble Lords, who occasionally came down for a few minutes to carry on or to obstruct the business of the country, occupied all the available room, there was no use in requiring the Members of the House of Commons to attend, and the Vote should be opposed by all hon. Gentlemen who had any respect for their own dignity.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00660"><member>MR. TULLY <memberconstituency>(Leitrim, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked for further details as to the expenditure under discussion. There was an item of &#x00A3;200 for the extension of electric lighting to the Royal Gallery; another &#x00A3;200 for additional supply of electric current; and &#x00A3;1,100 for additional cost of fuel, mainly in respect of steam coal used by the engineering branch. What was the steam coal required for? No justification had been given for the expenditure of such a large sum. The electric light was supplied from the electric mains; therefore, why should there be this additional expenditure in regard to steam coal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00661"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: Those items are not in connection with the opening of Parliament at all. The &#x00A3;1,400 is mainly in respect of steam coal used by the engineering branch during the year, and, as everyone knows, the price of coal has enormously increased during that period. With regard to the &#x00A3;200 for supply of electric current, that is an additional sum owing entirely to the fact that Parliament met for an autumn session, and also for a short</membercontribution></p>

As to the provision of the electric light in the Royal Gallery, that is not merely for the occasion of the opening of Parliament, but for all time; it is for the supply of standards and so on in a portion of the House which has not been used for forty years for similar purposes.

<p id="S4V0090P0-00677">Question put and agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00678">2. Motion made and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;2,500, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March,
<image src="S4V0090P0I0175"/>
<col>115</col>
1901, for Expenditure in respect of Art and Science Buildings, Great Britain."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00679"><member>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE</member><membercontribution> asked whether a corresponding supplementary Vote would be submitted with, regard to similar buildings in Ireland?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00680"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: I do not think that really arises here, but I am only too glad to answer any question. I understand the lion. Baronet to ask whether there is a corresponding Vote required for Ireland. I will endeavour to obtain that information, but I am not responsible for any buildings outside Great Britain.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00681"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said the Committee knew there would not be a corresponding Vote for Ireland, as the present represented the whole of the Civil Service Supplementary Estimate for the year. This Vote was claimed simply and solely on account of the increased price of coal. The point of the hon. Baronet was why, if this Supplementary Estimate was necessary in regard to public buildings in England and Scotland, was not a corresponding Vote required in connection with similar public buildings in Ireland? There should be some proof that this was a bon&#x00E2; fide claim due to a real deficit caused by the increase in the price of coal. Were the Committee to understand that in Ireland when coal rose in price the unfortunate inhabitants were obliged to shiver and do without coal in order to keep within the Estimate, while in Great Britain a different principle was applied?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00682"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: As I pointed out to the Committee, I am quite prepared to justify the Vote which I am asking for in regard to the extra expenditure due to the higher price of coal, so far as it affects those buildings for which I am responsible. But it is not for me to say whether the Secretary to the Treasury, who administers the public buildings in Ireland, has been more fortunate in his contracts. I can only tell the House what has occurred in regard to the price of coal in the buildings for which I am responsible in England. I will take this opportunity of answering the question put to me by the hon. Member opposite, which applies to all these Votes. The reasons for the extra cost in the coal contracts for the year are
<col>116</col>
two. In the first place there was a very large increase in the cost of steam coal since the time that the original estimates were prepared. There has been a very great increase in this respect, and consequently we have had to ask for more money for the warming and the lighting of these buildings. The other reason is because we have a different system in vogue now to that which has hitherto been the practice. We are paying this year for fourteen months supply of coal in the place of twelve months, because we are now supplying ourselves directly from the pit's mouth, instead of supplying ourselves through the middlemen and contractors in London; and we are paying ready money for our coals instead of paying quarterly, so that we are asking for a larger sum than if we bought under the old system. This is an advantage, because we get a very much better class of coal, and we have the control of the supply in our hands. We also get the advantage of the overweight which is always given when dealing direct with the colliery. We have saved in efficiency at least 15 per cent., and at least 5 per cent, in the overweight, besides securing a better quality of coal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00683"><member>MR. JORDAN</member><membercontribution> thought that in view of the fact that the right hon. Gentleman had been buying coal at cost price, and also getting the overweight, he would have been able to reduce and not increase the sum required for coal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00684"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: We should have had to pay a great deal more, owing to the extra price of coal, had we not been able to make this economical arrangement under the new system of purchasing direct from the collieries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00685"><member>MR. JORDAN</member><membercontribution> said that possibly this explanation was satisfactory, but he did not understand how that explanation could apply to such articles as water and household furniture.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00686"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: If the hon. Member will look at the bottom of the page he will see that the extra cost is due to the increase in the price of steam coal.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00690"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said this Vote was a glaring example of a custom which had grown from year to year since the present Government came into office, and which threatened to be a great public nuisance. He alluded to the system of covering the Notice Paper with Supplementary Estimates in almost every department of the public service. When he first came to the House of Commons Supplementary
<col>120</col>
Estimates were very few, and it was considered to be a reproach to any Minister to be compelled to put down a Supplementary Estimate unless he could allege some unforeseen circumstances. When a Minister came down to the House of Commons in past years and asked for a Supplementary Estimate he was always on the defensive, and he was bound to make out some special cause for his action. Consequently Ministers bringing forward such Estimates always rose and made a statement in regard to the grounds upon which the money was asked for. Nowadays, Ministers seemed to be proud of Supplementary Estimates, and the number and the amount of them was growing year by year. The original Estimate for Diplo-

<col>121</col>
matic and Consular Buildings was &#x00A3;30,000, and they were now asked, without any details whatever, to add to that sum an additional &#x00A3;2,000 for the maintenance and alterations of those buildings. The reason given for this extra expenditure in the Estimate was as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"Sundry urgent works, some due to changes of occupation, not anticipated when the original Estimate was prepared, were required to be carried out at, among other places, Vienna Embassy House, Brussels and Lisbon Legation Houses, and Cairo Agency House."</quote>
What was the meaning of "urgent works"? What were the urgent works necessary in the embassy and legation houses at Vienna and Lisbon? These urgent works were not anticipated at the beginning of the financial year, and why could they not have waited? He should like to know why the right hon. Gentleman had departed from the good and orthodox system of endeavouring to keep within the original Estimate unless something really urgent occurred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00691"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution> said that this increase of &#x00A3;2,000 was almost entirely due to changes in the <i>personnel</i> in the diplomatic and consular service which had rendered a change of occupants necessary. A certain amount of expense for the redecoration and repair of official residences upon a change of consul or ambassador was unavoidable. It was the custom, even in private life, when a man had been in possession of a house for a certain time to incur a certain amount of expense in order to prepare it for his successor.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00692"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL <memberconstituency>(Longford. N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> did not think that the explanation of the right hon. Gentleman was satisfactory, for this large expense seemed to have been incurred without steps being taken to carry out the work in the most economical way. He thought hon. Members from Ireland were only exercising their ordinary rights in closely criticising the proposals of the Government in the smallest detail. As an Irish Member he strongly protested against the Government having a free hand in expenditure of this kind without taking contracts in the usual way. Unless some more satisfactory explanation was given he
<col>122</col>
would move a substantial reduction in the Vote. He thought they were entitled to demand a more explicit statement in regard to this increased expenditure than that which they had received from the right hon. Gentleman, and he begged to move the reduction of this Vote by &#x00A3;2,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00693"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: That is the total amount of the Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00694"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL</member><membercontribution>: Then I will move to reduce it by &#x00A3;200.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00695">Motion made, and Question put, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;1,800, be granted for the said service."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. J. P. Farrell.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00696"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said the explanation of the right hon. Gentleman was by no means satisfactory. The only ground given for the increased Estimate of &#x00A3;2,000 was that changes had occurred in our embassies. Changes were always occurring in our embassies or agencies. It was the average state of things, and it ought to have been in the power of the Government to produce a more reasonable Estimate than the one before the Committee. He was aware that it was not reasonable to press unduly for details in the Estimates, because the elaborate details were matters for the Committee of Accounts, but the persons responsible for preparing the Estimates were surely bound to go so far as to let the Committee know where the money had been spent. The Estimates showed that &#x00A3;2,000 had been spent in Vienna, Brussels, Lisbon, and Cairo, and the Committee was entitled to know how much had been spent on each house. The real reason for his protest against this particular Estimate was the extraordinary statement of the First Lord of the Treasury on a previous occasion, that it was the practice of the Committee of Supply never to examine the Estimates. Such a practice would open the floodgates to every kind of jobbery and loose expenditure, if a Minister wished to make any additions to his house, if such openings were afforded by such a statement being made beforehand that it was the settled practice not to examine the Estimate. He protested against such a statement being made. It was the duty
<image src="S4V0090P0I0179"/>
<col>123</col>
of the Committee to examine the Estimates with great care, and to endeavour to remove any abuses and ensure economy in the financial business of the nation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00697"><member>SIR WALTER FOSTER <memberconstituency>(Derby, Ilkeston)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> desired to emphasise the views just put before the House, and appealed for a more definite explanation of that increase in the Estimate which, though small in itself, was a considerable amount when one considered the amount of the original Estimate. With a very little consideration, the Government ought to have been able to provide in the ordinary Estimates sufficient to cover these charges, but with the want of foresight which was so great a characteristic of the Government, they could not even look twelve months ahead.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00698"><member>MR. LABOUGHERE</member><membercontribution> said in his opinion the Vote ought to be reduced by at least &#x00A3;1,000, if at all, because although it might be necessary to keep up such establishments at Vienna and Brussels, it certainly was not at Lisbon and Cairo. At the time it was proposed to buy these houses he protested against it because it would lead to increased expenditure. It was unnecessary to bring into the present Estimates the residencies at Lisbon and Cairo, and therefore he should vote for the reduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00699"><member>MR. POWER <memberconstituency>(Waterford, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the Supplementary Estimate, although not large in itself, presented a large percentage of increase. He endorsed the remarks of the Member for East Mayo. When the First Lord introduced the Rule for the guillotining of the debate, it was pointed out that it would lead to a certain amount of looseness in preparing the Estimates, and when those who were in the House in the eighties recalled the trouble Ministers took to explain every Vote, they would recognise the change which had come over the practice of the House in the discussion of the financial business of the country, and that every year the amount of information given by the Ministers responsible was less.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00700"><member>MR. TULLY</member><membercontribution> said so far as the debate had gone it had shown that very little supervision was exercised over the financial business of the House. The
<col>124</col>
Supplementary Estimate was not large in itself, but at the same time the Committee was entitled to know how it had been expended and how much was spent on each house. The expense of an Agency in Cairo should not have been incurred, seeing that Egypt was a British dependency and, as he understood, was administered at a profit to this country. He supported the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00701"><member>MAJOR JAMESON</member><membercontribution> disclaimed any desire to detain the House, but felt compelled to say that what he objected to in this Estimate was its unbusinesslike character. He had some knowledge of how a Government contractor did his work; repairs were often made which were absolutely unnecessary, simply for the purpose of increasing the Expense, and whatever might be the position of England, Ireland at all events had not too much money to pay for these estimates. The four items dealt with should have been kept separate and not lumped together in one Estimate, because when it came to a question of voting Supplementary Estimates no one knew where it was going to end. So far as the Irish Members were concerned, they were determined to extract the greatest possible information from the Government in regard to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00702"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution> said the House of Commons took upon itself to criticise the work of some of the count councils in. Ireland, but, as a member of a county council, he would inform the Committee that no county council in Ireland could carry on its financial business in the way in which the fiscal business of the Empire was conducted. The fiscal business of the Empire was carried on in the loosest possible manner&#x2014;the House being expected to vote millions of money on the mere word of a Minister, no financial committee making any examination into the Estimates until they came to be considered by a Committee of the House. Such a practice was not one to recommend itself to a business man. He thought the business of the Empire ought to be carried out on business principles, and therefore he supported the Amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00703"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution> did not know who was responsible for the Estimate, but the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0180"/>
<col>125</col>
Estimate itself certainly showed that very loose management existed in the Department from which it emanated. It showed a great want of economy. He regretted also that as the amount was so small and we were so near the new financial year this Estimate could not have gone over with the ordinary Estimates, but no doubt the reason for bringing it in in this way was in order that the general Estimates should be made to look less. He was pleased the Amendment had been moved, and was of opinion that if a good fight were made by the Irish Members it would tend to make the Government more careful in the future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00704"><member>COLONEL NOLAN</member><membercontribution> thought that the Vote ought to be reduced by at least &#x00A3;1,500, as he saw no reason for maintaining any of these Embassies in Catholic countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00705"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: Order, order&#x0021; The hon. Member is not entitled to go into that question. All that is open to discussion is the amount in the Supplementary Estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00706"><member>COLONEL NOLAN</member><membercontribution> drew attention to the fact that in the original Estimates a sum was allowed for this purpose, and he thought that amount ought never to be exceeded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00707"><member>MR. FLYNN</member><membercontribution> expressed the opinion that if a county or district council in Ireland prepared their accounts in such a fashion as the Estimates of the Empire were prepared there would soon be a strong complaint from the Local Government Board. Some explanation ought to be given by those responsible for the Estimates such as the Committee had the pleasure to listen to when the Treasury was represented by the present President of the Board of Agriculture. On the Front Opposition Bench there was at one time a party whose cry was Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform, but that party, judging from the state of the bench, had disappeared. It had come to this, that the iconoclastic, revolutionary, and semi-socialistic persons re presenting in that House the people of Ireland were the only persons who looked at the Estimates with a critical sense of economy.</membercontribution></p>
<col>126</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00708"><member>MR. FLAVIN <memberconstituency>(Kerry, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> hoped some explanation would be forthcoming. All that the right hon. Gentleman said was that urgent work was necessary; he gave no details. He submitted that no business man would accept an account which only contained the lump sum in respect of several items, and in this case the House ought to be treated as a customer who, having to pay the money, was entitled to receive a detailed account.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00709"><member>MR. DALZIEL</member><membercontribution> complained that the application by hon. Members for details had not been acceded to, but he thought, at all events, they were entitled to a courteous reply, if it only contained reasons why no details were to be given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00710"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution> said he had already explained that there had recently been many changes in the <i>personnel</i> of the diplomatic and consular service, and expense had unavoidably been incurred in redecoration and repairs of official residences on a change of Consul or Ambassador. It was the general thing to do. Hon. Members themselves did it when they took a house after the expiry of a lease.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00711"><member>MR. JORDAN</member><membercontribution> had no objection to putting these houses into repair, that was a thing that everybody did. His objection lay in the fact that no details; being before the Committee, the Committee was unable to form an opinion as; to whether the work had been economically carried out. In all these cases there was a lack of business detail. If the Committee had been in possession of the details of the &#x00A3;2,000 they might, having found the details correct, have agreed to the Estimate. As matters stood, he should vote against the lump sum.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00712"><member>MR.CALDWELL<memberconstituency>(Lanarkshire, Mid)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it appeared to him that what was gene rally complained of was a want of specification in the Estimate. The Committee would notice that in Section B there was a Vote for &#x00A3;500 for anything that might not be foreseen. There were a great many changes in our diplomatic service-every year, and the changes of one year balanced the changes of another, and
<image src="S4V0090P0I0181"/>
<col>127</col>
that sum of &#x00A3;500 was put in in order to meet anything extraordinary which might take place. The Estimate ought to have stated what the particular expenses were, and the amount required at each place. The whole complaint</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00716">4. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;7,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during

the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, for the expenses of the Post Office and Post Office Telegraph buildings in Great Britain, including furniture, fuel, and sundry miscellaneous services."</p>

<col>133</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00717"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL</member><membercontribution> thought it would be admitted that the criticism of these Votes had been very useful. The total original Estimate in this instance was &#x00A3;316,000, and without any explanation an additional &#x00A3;7,000 was asked for. It was said to be in consequence of the additional cost of steam coal in the engineering branches. He did not know much about the arrangements for the postal service in London, and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would explain what was meant by the "engineering branches." Everybody knew that coal had increased in price, but he understood that the Post Office were now paying more for coal at the pit mouth than they were formerly paying to the contractors.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00718"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: Less, not more.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00719"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL</member><membercontribution> accepted the correction of the right hon. Gentleman, but he was speaking on the authority of Members who knew something of the subject when he made the statement. There was another reason why the Irish representatives should discuss this Vote. London was one of the largest and richest cities in the world, and served by a very big Department. But the Irish people gained no benefit whatever from the large expenditure involved, and it was not fair that they should be expected to contribute something like &#x00A3;30,000 for the accommodation of the people of London in this matter. It was an extraordinary thing that in each case where the Department came for a Vote it was increasing an original Estimate which it had been thought would be sufficient for the year. If satisfactory explanations were not forthcoming it would be the duty of the Irish Members to take the opinion of the House as to whether these constant increases were justified. There was an utter absence of detail in regard to the expenditure. For all the House knew, there might be a large amount of jobbery concealed in these items. It certainly would not be much trouble to print, in addition to the bald information now supplied, a schedule giving particulars which would explain these matters.</membercontribution></p>
<col>134</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00720"><member>MR. TULLY</member><membercontribution> thought this Vote was another instance of the slovenly manner in which the Estimates were presented. It was not fair to ask for an additional sum of &#x00A3;7,000 on an original Estimate of &#x00A3;15,009 without giving any information. If officials got a free hand in these matters, knowing there would be no inquiry, they would pile up extras at an enormous rate. No confidence could be placed in any estimate coming from the Post Office Department, as Committees sitting upstairs knew how the leading officials of the Department juggled with the finances of the country. As an illustration he might instance the case of the telegraphs&#x2014;they were to have been bought for &#x00A3;3,000,000, but when the Post Office had done taking the public money &#x00A3;17,000,000 had been paid. The Committee had been told that instead of buying the coal from contractors the Post Office officials were to do a stroke of economy by buying at the pit mouth, and thus avoid the I middleman's profits. What was the result as soon as they had this free hand? There was this increased demand for &#x00A3;7,000. That ought to appeal to the Liberal Members to support the Irish I representatives more than they had done in criticising these Votes. If these small sums were not looked into with care and discrimination they would soon mount to very large totals.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00721"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution> pointed out that in the footnote to this Estimate it was stated that this &#x00A3;7,000 was due partly for steam coal. What did "partly" mean? With regard to purchasing coal at the pit mouth, was the contract put out to tender, or had the Government given it to some particular firm? As one who knew a little about the coal business, he was surprised to hear that by buying the coal direct from the collieries the right hon. Gentleman obtained extra weight. If he had been so fortunate he had been more lucky than most people. What foundation had the right hon. Gentleman for that statement? Had he personally seen the coal weighed? Another point was, how much per ton had the Government paid for the coal I That there should be a Supplementary Estimate of &#x00A3;7,000 on an original Esti-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0185"/>
<col>135</col>
mate of only &#x00A3;15,000 seemed to point to great incapacity on the part of the department that made such a wrong calculation, and it was nothing short of an insult to the Committee that they should be asked to pass such Supplementary Estimates without any particulars or explanation whatever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00722"><member>MR. CALDWELL,</member><membercontribution> in reference to the appeal to the Liberal benches by the hon. Member for South Leitrim, said he had not seen any necessity for the Liberals to interfere in the Votes so far as they had gone. The Local Government Act in Ireland had evidently been most beneficial, one of its fruits being that Irish Members, being now accustomed to local government and to the manner in which accounts should be kept, were able with that experience to come and give a lesson in the matter of accounts to the House of Commons. He never thought that the Government would have put forward the price of coal as a reason for the present Estimate, because there had not been a rise in the price since the Estimates were prepared. The Government evidently thought that they were going to make a good bargain by taking the coal supply into their own hands, and they made a contract for fourteen months supply of coal just before the price went down.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00723"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution> said he could only repeat the explanation which he had given on the previous Vote as to the causes of the increase. A very great increase had taken place in the price of the coal. The Estimates were prepared in November and December of the year before the last, and that Estimate had been exceeded. Hon. Members opposite must be aware that the extra cost of coal had been felt very severely not only by individuals, but also by large undertakings. Under the new arrangement which the Government had made they were paying for a fourteen months supply, whereas the original estimate was made only for twelve months. They had been told that as the Government were very large consumers of coal, and consumed in their public departments something like 24,000 tons
<col>136</col>
of steam coal annually, they ought to make arrangements whereby they could supply themselves from the pit's mouth. Such an arrangement was entered into, and it came into effect on the 3rd of July last. They were now getting steam coal direct from the collieries, and it was being paid for monthly, whereas it was paid for quarterly before. They were distributing it themselves, and were actually placing it in the cellars of the public departments. By this means they could guarantee that the coal was of the description which it professed to be, and they could ensure greater punctuality in the delivery. By this new system they got not only a very much better class of coal but they had a much smaller amount of what were known as "sweepings." On the whole, the experiment they had made in this direction had worked extremely well. They had now got their own wharf in London, and they had a practical man resident there who inspected the coal and saw it weighed before it was delivered to the Government departments. They had now under the present system an assurance that the coal they were receiving was of the quality ordered. They were also getting the advantage of the overweight by dealing directly with the collieries, and they would not get that additional weight if they bought from the middleman or the contractor. With regard to-the price, they were paying for steam coal 18s. 3d. per ton at the pit's mouth. They were consuming some 24,000 tons-of coal annually, and they were practically saving about 1s. per ton upon the prices which they would have to pay in London</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00724"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON <memberconstituency>(Tower Hamlets, Poplar)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> agreed that the Department were doing well in dealing directly with the collieries, instead of allowing the middleman to get a profit. That course was certainly putting the matter on a more businesslike footing. The right hon. Gentleman opposite had given the Committee a full explanation, but he agreed with his hon. friend behind him that some such explanation ought to have been put on the Estimate itself If the terms of this new arrangement had been set forth on the Estimate this
<image src="S4V0090P0I0186"/>
<col>137</col>
discussion would have been unnecessary, and the right hon. Gentleman would have been saved a good deal of trouble. One point he wished for an explanation upon was how the right hon. Gentleman made out that he had effected a real saving by taking this contract for fourteen months instead of twelve months, in view of the high price of coal?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00725"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: We did not make such a contract. What I said was that by the present system we are paying ready money, whereas formerly we paid only quarterly. It is only for this particular year that we are paying for this extra two months supply. By this system of paying ready money instead of paying quarterly we have got two more months supply in the year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00726"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON</member><membercontribution> said that when the new contract was arranged last July the price of coal was about the highest, and it had come down in price since that time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00727"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: But we did not enter into a contract for a year at all. We simply made this new arrangement, and the extra two months, as I have-already explained, is entirely owing to the different method of payment. We are now paying for our coal in advance, and consequently we have to put two more months in the Estimate. We did not enter into a year's contract last July.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00728"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON</member><membercontribution> accepted this explanation, and said there was one other point upon which he should like an explanation. He wished to know whether a considerable number of respectable producers were asked to contract for the supply, and was the lowest tender accepted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00729"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: Yes, a considerable number of producers were asked to tender, and the lowest tender was accepted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00730"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution> said that the right hon. Gentleman's explanation was not satisfactory He moved a reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;1,000.</membercontribution></p>
<col>138</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00731">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;6,000, be granted for the said Service."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Daly.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00732"><member>MR. NANNETTI <memberconstituency>(Dublin, College Green)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he desired to enter his protest against this increase in the expenditure, because it showed very bad management on the part of the parties responsible. He happened to be connected with a corporation which had to buy coal, and when the difficulty complained of by the right hon. Gentleman occurred they made their arrangements for purchasing coal accordingly. The parties responsible for this contract had very much mistaken their position, and they had made a mistake in giving out a contract which was far in excess of the requirements of the case. He was very much surprised indeed that hon. Gentlemen opposite were satisfied with this state of things, and were leaving all the criticism to Members on the Opposition side of the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00733"><member>MR. O'MARA <memberconstituency>(Kilkenny, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the right hon. Gentleman opposite had pointed out that the Government had been purchasing coal in a cheaper way, and under those circumstances he could not understand why there had been an increase of &#x00A3;4,000 in twelve months. Last winter was not very cold, and how was it that in public offices some attempt was not made to economise in the quantity of coal used and so reduce the expenditure of the country? To his mind 18s. 3d. per ton was a very excessive price to pay for steam coal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00734"><member>MR. FLAVIN</member><membercontribution> regarded the right hon. Gentleman's statement as very unsatisfactory, and he wished to know why a fourteen months contract was entered into last July.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00735"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: I did not state that such a contract was entered into last July. What I said was that the new arrangement came into force in that month. We certainly did not make such a contract in July.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00736"><member>MR. FLAVIN</member><membercontribution> said he understood that the new system came into opera-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0187"/>
<col>139</col>
tion in July. He wished to know when the Government commenced paying the price which had been quoted, and had that price been continued up to the present moment. The right hon. Gentleman had not explained that I point. If the information he had received was correct, steam coal was now worth between 3s. to 5s. a ton less I than it was in July, when this arrangement was entered into. Taking the 24,000 tons consumed during the fourteen months at 18s. 3d. per ton, according to the present price of steam coal they were paying an overcharge of 5s. per ton. [Ministerial laughter.] He thought he was perfectly entitled to say that, because the First Commissioner of Works had given them no explanation of it. Hon. Gentlemen opposite sat there and absolutely refused to ask a single question upon this subject. This was not the first occasion upon which Irish Members had considered it their duty to examine the details of a Supplementary Estimate, and they were quite prepared to accept the laughter of hon. Gentlemen opposite. The fact remained that they laughed and did nothing else. What they wanted to know was when the contract was entered into, and whether the price of 18s. 3d. per ton was given last July, August, or September.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00737"><member>MR. CLEAN <memberconstituency>(Cork, S.E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that what struck him in connection with this Vote was not so much the amount of money in excess of the original estimate, but the system of contracting. If the humblest county or parish council in Ireland were to prepare its estimates in this fashion, and then add 50 per cent, to them, the Local Government Board would come down on it, surcharge the amount, and make the members pay the excess. If that system were introduced in the Government departments they would have none of these Supplementary Estimates. At present the work was evidently done in a very slipshod way. Ho was perfectly well aware that so long as the Government had such a big majority behind them, their supporters would swallow anything, even if it were as big as a whale, or so long as it was for the consumption
<col>140</col>
of Government money. He supposed the same thing would happen if the Liberals were in power, and ho maintained that it was the Irish Nationalists who could alone, with clean hands, criticise the Government departments in their dealings with the country. If the war contracts were conducted on the same principle as the right hon. Gentleman had conducted the contracts for his office, no wonder they were spending hundreds of millions in South Africa. The Irish people had to pay the piper more in proportion to their means than the English, and they could not afford to allow this extravagant expenditure over estimates to go on. [Laughter.] Hon. Gentlemen opposite-might laugh, hut they would laugh with the wrong side of their mouth if they did that sort of thing in Ireland. Hon. Gentlemen opposite were very good when they went to their constituents and said they would carefully look into these things; hut the moment they were elected they did not care how the taxpayer's money was spent. They in Ireland did care, and hence their protest against this extravagance. He did not want to waste the time of the Committee, but if more time was spent in discussing the Estimates there would be less waste of public money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00738"><member>*MR. MANSFIELD <memberconstituency>(Lincolnshire, Spalding)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he did not question the principle of these contracts, but the true secret was to choose the light time for entering into them. The right hon. Gentleman had explained that the contract was for fourteen months and not for twelve months, but he had given no-idea when it was entered into. If that had been done in July it was what no business firm would have done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00739"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution> said he would point out again that although the contract, for a certain fixed amount of coal, dated from the 1st of July, it did not necessarily follow that they made it on that date. There was no desire whatever on the part of the Department to keep back anything from the House, but to give the actual facts as to the date of the contract.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0188"/>
<col>141</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00740"><member>*MR. MANSFIELD</member><membercontribution> thought that under the circumstances it would be better to postpone the Vote. What he was seeking to know was, whether the contract was entered into on the 1st of July at July prices, or whether it was entered into prior to July at lower prices. At what price per ton did the contract allow the coal proprietor? He would like to be clear as to whether the Government had given a price at high-water mark, and so secured for the contractors a rate which in a year's time the contractors could not have hoped to have obtained. He noticed that the fuel for the Post Office had risen 50 per cent., while that for the Science and Art Department had only increased 6 per cent., and for Public Buildings Department 8 per cent. Would the right hon. Gentleman tell the Committee the reason for this enormous difference? Was there one contract, or different contracts entered into at separate times? It would not be amiss if someone went down from the Public Buildings Department, or, better still, from the Science and Art Department to the Post Office, and made some inquiries as to the cause of these enormous differences. It would be a pity if they were asked to vote for this huge increase, and to be kept absolutely in the dark as to the reason for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00741"><member>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE</member><membercontribution> said that if the right hon. Gentleman could not give the information, he supposed it was not owing to his fault, but to that of the person who drew up the statement. He thought the right hon. Gentleman should postpone the Vote to enable him to obtain full and accurate information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00742"><member>MR. CALDWELL</member><membercontribution> said he too would appeal that the Vote should be postponed. The right hon. Gentleman had, after he had drawn attention to it, himself to admit that the Vote was not correct in this respect, that whilst they had put &#x00A3;7,000 under item M, item Rought to have been included, which would have brought the sum up to &#x00A3;20,000. That one point showed that the Government came before the Committee with defective Estimates. But more than that, if the right hon. Gentleman would refer to the
<col>142</col>
explanation given in the foot-note, he would find that it had nothing to do with; the explanation now given from the Front Bench. The explanation in the, foot-note was&#x2014;"Additional cost of fuel, partly steam coal, required for the engineering branches." But the explanation given from the Front Bench was that the increase was due to the contract being for fourteen months instead of twelve. But the difference would only amount to &#x00A3;4,000 for the two months, supposing the whole quantity of coal had been taken, and that left &#x00A3;3,000 or &#x00A3;4,000 entirely unexplained. The increase in the price of coal had nothing whatever to do with the increase of expenditure, because, if they took this same Vote under item J, for coal fuel for the port of London and the outports in England, Wales, and Scotland, amounting to &#x00A3;9,000, no increase was asked for. How did they make out that in a particular Department in London there was an enormous increase in the price of coal, while there was no increase whatever in the price throughout England, Wales, and Scotland? There must be some explanation, but obviously that given both on the Estimates and from the Front Bench was insufficient and incomplete. For their own credit he beseeched the Government to withdraw this Vote&#x2014;the Estimates would not all be pushed through that night&#x2014; and bring it forward on Monday with full information, and then the Committee would be able to deal with it in a spirit which would be intelligent at least. His experience of the House was that when person the Government would not get on with their other Estimates if they insisted on going on with the disputed one without explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00743"><member>MR. JORDAN</member><membercontribution> said his excuse for the right hon. Gentleman was that he was new to his office, and had not been able to give the attention desirable to his permanent officials, who desired, of course, to "boss" the whole thing. These permanent officials had evidently furnished the right hon. Gentleman with Estimates without any details, and they had thought that hon. Members were fools enough to pass them without discussion. But the Committee had been indued with a
<image src="S4V0090P0I0189"/>
<col>143</col>
spirit of investigation, and intended to exercise it. He appealed to the right hon. the First Commissioner of Works to postpone the Vote, at any rate until Monday; and between now and then he could see his permanent officials and consult with them as to how a detailed Estimate could be brought in. The right hon. the First Commissioner could come on Monday fresh and primed for his work, as they also would be.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00744"><member>MR. O'MARA</member><membercontribution> said he had just been doing a little sum on paper, and found that there had been an increase of 26 per cent, on the original Estimate. If the First Commissioner had been chairman of a railway company, and had come before his shareholders and told them that there had been an increase of 26 per cent, in the cost of running the locomotive department, the shareholders would have immediately appointed a committee of investigation to inquire where the money had gone. An hon. Member had drawn attention to the fact that this increase was only for London. The figures were very interesting. Over the whole country &#x00A3;316,000 was spent for fuel, and in London &#x00A3;22,000. That was only 7 per cent, of the total amount spent in the whole of England. Now, it was a very curious thing that there should have been an increase of 50 per cent, in the cost of coal in London, and no increase at all in the money spent in all the provincial towns. He could not understand how the price of coal had risen 50 per cent, in London, and had remained the same in every town in the country. He joined in the appeal made to the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw this Vote until he had a full explanation to offer to the Committee. [Laughter.] Although there was a good deal of laughter on the Government benches, the country would not be satisfied with the explanation given by the First Commissioner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00745"><member>MR. WILLIAM REDMOND <memberconstituency>(Clare, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it was an extraordinary thing that no British representative, except a few on the Opposition side of the House, had offered any opposition whatever to
<col>144</col>
these accounts. Was it to go out to the public that supporters of His Majesty's Government were prepared to sit perfectly silent when they found such a large increase in the Votes without one of them asking the Minister responsible why the increase had come about? Outside the House he had heard representatives of the British public saying that they opposed Home Rule because they were always glad in Committee of Supply to have the Irish Members standing up and objecting to extravagance on the part of the Government, which the supporters of the Government were either unwilling or afraid to put out. The hon. Member who spoke from Scotland had appealed to the First Commissioner of Works to postpone this Vote, and he would repeat that appeal. He would ask whether any Gentleman representing the Government on the Front Bench could point to a single precedent where a responsible Minister in Committee of Supply had got up and frankly admitted that he had not got the particulars asked for, and at the same time refused to postpone the, Vote in question until he had obtained the particulars which would enable him to answer inquiries made? If they were not to receive detailed explanation from the Minister in charge of these Votes, and if inquiries addressed to him in a reasonable way were not to be listened to the sooner a fresh arrangement was made the better, whereby Ministers could allocate the public money in any way they pleased without coming to the House and asking for it. He had heard it said that the reason for this large increase of &#x00A3;7,000 in one year was due to the increased price of coal. That might be the reason for all he knew, but it ought to be the duty of the responsible Minister to take steps to guard the public against such an exorbitant increase, in the price of a necessary of life like coal, which came from time to time on the public. They had heard that fuel ought to be laid in stock by municipalities, so that the public could have a supply at a reasonable rate. Whether that were so or not, he submitted that the Government ought to take steps to lay in a sufficient supply of fuel, in order to protect the taxpayers, when they had reason to believe that the price was to be raised to an exorbitant rate. If this extraordinary increase
<image src="S4V0090P0I0190"/>
<col>145</col>
was the result of the increased price of coal, then that increased price had been purely fictitious, and had enormously and extravagantly enriched the coal merchants, and to a great extent the coal-owners, from which the public ought to have been protected. For the Government to come down and, without a word of explanation, calmly to ask the representatives of the taxpayers to pay &#x00A3;22,700, instead of &#x00A3;15,700, owing to an increase in the price of coal, was an extravagant and outrageous thing. He quite agreed with what fell from the hon. Member for North Wexford, that the lack of details and the absence of explanations asked for might not be in any single way the fault of the First Commissioner of Works. So far as he had had experience of the right hon. Gentleman in the office he held, they had always found him quite ready to give any explanation in his power; but on this occasion he told them frankly that he had not got at his disposal the facts that would throw some light on this extravagant increase. He certainly thought that some hon. Gentlemen supporting His Majesty's Government should lend assistance to the appeal they were making to the right hon. Gentleman; because, after all, the constituents of hon. Gentlemen opposite were as much interested in this matter as Irish constituents. He believed there was not one of them who,</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00755">Resolutions to be reported.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00756">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;35,200, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, in respect of sundry Public Buildings in Great Britain, not provided for on other Votes."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00757"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON</member><membercontribution>: I wish to ask for information with regard to this Vote. In the Votes we have been discussing this evening, our chief difficulty has been that we have not had that information which would be thought requisite in submitting an original Estimate. My contention is that these items ought not to appear as Supplementary Estimates at all. They ought to have been anticipated at the time the Estimates were framed, and it is not right or fair to the House of Commons, which has to vote the money of this country, that these enormous Supplementary Estimates should be introduced in this fashion, We have before us today I believe the largest Supplementary Estimates that have ever been presented to the House of Commons. A few years ago it was the exception to introduce Supplementary Estimates except under special circumstances. Year by year, however, an increasing number of Supplementary Estimates are being presented to the House of Commons, and it is on that point that I wish to ask the right hon. Gentleman a few questions. In the discussion on the last two Votes, the right hon. Gentleman said he was not personally responsible; that one Vote had reference to the Foreign Office, and the other to the Post Office.
<col>158</col>
No doubt to a certain extent the right hon Gentleman was in the hands of these, offices, but he is directly responsible for the Estimate which I now desire to criticise. The first item is Census Buildings, &#x00A3;2,100. The right hon. Gentleman, when we were discussing the Foreign Office Vote, said that the reason for the Supplementary Estimate was that it could not be anticipated, inasmuch as some of the ambassadors had been moved from one place to another, and the houses had to be altered for the new occupants. That to a certain extent is reasonable, but surely the right hon. Gentleman must have known that the Census comes every ten years, and that a building for the taking of it would be required this year. We know that during the last year or two the Government have never anticipated anything, and that the expected was the one thing they were never prepared for. Here was an Estimate which could have been anticipated with the greatest ease, and there is no possible excuse for presenting the House of Commons with a Supplementary Estimate regarding it. The next item is the fitting up of Hertford House, Manchester Square. That is a matter that has been going on for some years, and which might have been fully anticipated if the right hon. Gentleman had only chosen to anticipate it. Further on, there is an item for the Royal Mint, and also for the introduction and extension of electric lighting in the principal public buildings. I ask the right hon. Gentleman how it is that all these items were not anticipated 1 Not only might they have been anticipated, but it was his bounden duty to anticipate them. This is a matter in which this House is very much concerned, because if Estimates are so under-estimated,as they would seem
<image src="S4V0090P0I0197"/>
<col>159</col>
to have been from these huge Supplementary Votes, the annual statement which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has to make is really totally misleading to the country. The only conclusion that I can draw is that the finance of last year was so bad, and the Government thinking the war was coming to an end, all these different Departments were instructed to keep back every possible Estimate and have it introduced subsequently as a Supplementary Estimate. Even to this Govermnent, a million is a considerable item, and therefore I think we are entitled to ask the right hon. Gentleman, how it is that such items as Census buildings, Hertford House, the Royal Mint, and the introduction of electric lighting were not anticipated in the Estimates that were originally framed? I hope he will be able to give us a satisfactory explanation, but if he does not, I shall certainly vote against the Estimate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00758"><member>MR. BROADHURST <memberconstituency>(Leicester)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said there was one item of a very interesting nature in the Vote, and that was the alteration of Winchester House, to be adapted to the Intelligence Department of the Government. If the Government would increase that item to some extent, he was sure it would be readily passed. A larger devotion of Government resources to the Intelligence Department would have obviated many of the blunders committed by the Government during the last few years. He especially desired to request information in respect to the moiety of the further portion of the cost of site and erection of buildings for the King's Bench and Probate Registries of the High Court of Justice, of which the total estimate was &#x00A3;19,800. What part of that was the cost of the site, and what part was the cost of the building? There was another item, Patent Office extension, acquisition of site and erection of buildings &#x00A3;3,000. It would, he thought, much facilitate the passing of these Votes if more detailed
<col>160</col>
information regarding them was given. The amount given for the site and the amount to be expended on the building should be given separately, and he thought that the House of Commons was also entitled to know what class of building it was proposed to erect, what was the material to be used, and what provision had been made to see that the material agreed upon was really used by the contractor, and that the work was carried out in accordance with the specification. He asked for information on these points,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00759"><member>MR. FLYNN</member><membercontribution> said he was surprised at the innocence of the hon. Gentlemen, above the gangway, who, however, he was glad to see were waking up to a sense of their duty as the representatives of the taxpayers. The hon. Member for Poplar spoke of the absent-mindedness of the Government. Surely it was not a matter of surprise that the Government had only now awakened to the fact that there was a census every ten years. It was only yesterday that they discovered that the 1st of April this year fell on a Sunday. There was one very remarkable sum in the Vote, and that was in connection with the Wallace Exhibition. He believed that no one would grudge money for housing such a priceless collection of ancient and modern art, but surely the buildings ought to have been provided before the collection was arranged. The gallery was opened last May, and how it was that nearly twelve months afterwards there should be a Supplementary Estimate passed his comprehension altogether. He was delighted that hon. Gentlemen above the gangway were waking up to their duty. The Government had hoped to slip all these Estimates through without protest or examination, and would have succeeded were it not for the more or less accidental presence of a large number of Irish Members. There was also an item in the Vote of nearly &#x00A3;10,000 for the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0198"/>
<col>161</col>
London University. The Irish Members would certainly inquire as to how that money was to be spent. They could not get &#x00A3;1,000 for the Queen's College in Belfast or Cork, while &#x00A3;10,000 was to be given to the London University. He did not know what genius was responsible for the Imperial Institute, but everyone knew it was a dismal failure, and now, at very short notice, it was to be dedicated to the purposes of the London University. The Irish Members strongly objected to that, first of all on the general principle, and secondly because money was being spent with a lavish hand in this country, while &#x00A3;10 would not be given for obviously necessary purposes in Ireland. These Supplementary Estimates called for the strongest protests from hon. Members representing the taxpayers. They were now on the threshold of a new financial year, and these huge sums were asked for instead of the Estimates being submitted to the House in a businesslike manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00760"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution> said there was one point about the Estimates which he thought was possibly a mistake, but which certainly deserved the attention of the right hon. Gentleman. Only one item&#x2014;item A&#x2014;was explained, and no explanation whatever regarding the others was given. Item B was for maintenance and repairs&#x2014;&#x00A3;2,000. Maintenance and repairs of what? The object to which this sum was to be devoted should be stated. The Committee ought not to be called upon to pass Supplementary Estimates which could have been fairly included in the Estimates for the year. Surely the Government knew what their rent, tithe rent-charge, and insurance would be. There was another point on which he believed the Committee would desire an explanation. A sound canon which ought to be observed in connection with Supplementary Estimates was that nothing should be included in a Supple-
<col>162</col>
mentary Estimate which could stand over. He did not believe in such financial juggling. The new buildings mentioned in the Supplementary Estimates I could have remained over until they could be included in the finances of the; next year. Then there was a serious item with reference to the extension of the Royal Mint, which he understood had nothing to do with the new Sovereign. Why could that building not remain; over until next month? He asked the right hon. Gentleman to explain why none of the items except item A were I explained, and, secondly, why the proposed new buildings could not have stood over.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00761"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said that there was one item to which he desired to direct attention, and that was the sum of &#x00A3;2,950 for additional accommodation for the War I Office. It was only two years since they were called upon to vote a sum of two millions to erect a gorgeous new palace for the War Office. He himself and other hon. Members resisted that Vote for a considerable period on the ground that the country ought not to be called upon to spend an enormous sum of money for the erection of a new War Office until they had a Department fit to put into it. What had the War Office done during the last two years to entitle it to demand an additional sum of money? In his opinion, the performances of the War Office had been of such a character; that the Committee ought to be very slow to grant any money to it until it was reformed. When he voiced these sentiments he was not speaking the; opinion of the Irish and Radical Members, but the opinion of that large section of the public represented by the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Times</i> newspapers, who denounced the War Office as the source of all the misfortunes of this Country in the field. Why could not the War Office get along in the buildings that had been in existence for the last
<image src="S4V0090P0I0199"/>
<col>163</col>
twenty years? It was monstrous to I bring forward as an urgent matter suitable for a Supplementary Estimate expenditure on a temporary building for the War Office, when they were spending &#x00A3;2,000,000 in erecting a new palace in Whitehall for the accommodation of that incapable. Department. He accepted the evidence of <i>The Times</i>&#x2014;which he read every morning with great interest&#x2014;and had come to a conclusion, with <i>The Times,</i> that there never was a more incapable Department in any country than the War Office. Let the War Office conduct its ill-omened operations in the buildings in which it had worked for the last twenty years. He considered it a scandalous waste of public money to spend the sum mentioned in the Estimates for the temporary accommodation of these gentlemen. Every page of the Supplementary Estimates bore evidence of the fact that all the Departments had adopted the policy which was preached the other day by the First Lord of the Treasury&#x2014;namely, that it was not the business of the House of Commons to examine Estimates at all, and that Departments requiring money could claim it without instructing the Member of the House who represented them as to how it was to be spent. In old days when a Minister had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate he did so with an apology, but no apology was made nowadays. The items under discussion should not have appeared in a Supplementary Estimate at all, because they were not urgent, and they could have been easily anticipated, or could have remained over until the 31st March. The Vote was an instance of the slipshod and reckless way in which the Estimates were prepared. He would move a reduction in the Vote, but did not wish to interfere with other lion. Members who might desire to adopt that course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00762"><member>MR. KEIR HAEDIE <memberconstituency>(Merthyr Tydvil)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: said he would ask the First Commissioner of Works to explain certain of the items. He wished to know whether the Government had considered the advisability of doing its own insurance. Great municipalities were now insuring their own property, and were thereby saving in
<col>164</col>
some cases as much as 75 per cent, of what they had formerly paid to the insurances companies. The insurance charges of the Government must be very heavy, and ho trusted that the right hon. Gentleman would inform the Committee whether Government insurance was effected in private offices, or whether the Government had an Insurance Department of its own. Then with reference to the items for fuel and household articles, they were all aware of the tremendous increase in the cost of coal, and some of them were equally aware, that practically every penny of that increase found its way into the pockets of the employers. It would be interesting to know from the First Commissioner of Works how many contracts for fuel were placed with members of the House of Commons or with companies in which hon. Members were shareholders. It was of the utmost importance to know exactly how public funds were being spent. With reference to the item for the supply of water, he should like an explanation from the right hon. Gentleman as to the sum of &#x00A3;1,200 extra which was required. They were all aware that the London water companies had that day withdrawn a most absurd proposal with regard to making cisterns-compulsory in connection with the water supply of dwellings. It might he that the &#x00A3;1,200, or some part of it was required to enable the Government to comply with the demands of the water companies in regard to cisterns. If that were so, the money would not now be needed. The water cisterns which were to be made compulsory were specified in the proposal put forward by the companies, and part of the specification was that the drainage pipe should be placed a few inches from the bottom of the cistern, the reason given being that if the exhaust pipe were placed at the bottom of the cistern dead cats, etc., would find their way down the drain pipe, and the companies would have to bear the expense of cleaning out the cisterns. Therefore the pipes were to be so arranged that dead cats and so on might remain in the cisterns and improve the quality of the water. IL-entirely agreed with what had been said with reference to bringing forward in a Supplementary Estimate items
<image src="S4V0090P0I0200"/>
<col>165</col>
which ought to be included in the general Budget. It was a method of spending public money which should be censured in the strongest possible manner. He was a strong advocate of direct taxation, because if taxation had to be paid direct there would be economy, and fewer filibustering wars would be entered upon; but he was also in favour of direct account keeping. He hoped the right lion. Gentleman would give the information he asked for.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00763"><member>MR. GODDARD <memberconstituency>(Ipswich)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that it was rather surprising that no amount of criticism seemed to be able to draw any reply from the right lion. Gentle man in charge of the Vote. Surely the criticism which had been advanced was sufficiently serious to warrant some kind of reply, Attention had already been directed to Item C, for which &#x00A3;5,500 was asked. He thought it a very dangerous practice for Estimates of this kind to be passed without a proper explanation. The Committee had a perfect right to demand full details, and he would give an illustration to show the necessity of having them. Last year a question was raised by the Auditor General with reference to certain items in the furniture account. Among them was an item of &#x00A3;100 for the purchase and restoration of two portraits of King William IV. and Queen Adelaide for the Foreign Office, and the Auditor General reported that that item should not have appeared under the head of furniture, and should have obtained the special sanction of the Treasury. There was no information as to how the sum of &#x00A3;1,325 now asked for was to be expended, and it could not be known what the items were until the Estimates came before the Public Accounts Committee; but that was simply shutting the stable door after the steed had been stolen, as the expenditure could not then be prevented. He hoped the right hon. Gentleman would no longer delay giving the information asked for with reference to the various items.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00764"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: I was waiting to reply until hon. Members had
<col>166</col>
I finished. First of all, I may take the point raised with regard to the explanation which is given regarding Item A and not given regarding the other items. It has always been the practice to give items for new works I in detail, but not items for maintenance. Then with regard to the Census, Buildings, we have been told-that we ought to have foreseen the expenditure on regard to them, and that therefore there was no necessity to bring forward, as a Supplementary Estimate. I think a; sum of &#x00A3;4,000 was taken last year for the preparation of buildings for the purpose if collecting the census. Since then very considerable additions to the information to be collected have been asked for by hon. Members, with the result that an extra staff has to be provided. Therefore it can hardly be said that we could have foreseen what might have been required in the year to come. Then I was asked by the: hon. Member for Leicester a question with regard to the Vote for the King's Bench and Probate Registries Buildings in Manchester. He also asked me the separate cost of the site and buildings. The total estimated cost is &#x00A3;19,800, of which the site cost &#x00A3;11,100 and the buildings &#x00A3;8,700. As against that, the old buildings are being sold for some &#x00A3;4,500. He also asked me for particulars with regard to the material used in the buildings, and also as to proper supervision during their construction. The materials are properly selected and every care is taken by competent surveyors to see that the Government gets value for its money. The hon. Member for West Islington asked me a question with regard to the Patent Office Extension, and he said that at all events in this case we might have foreseen the extra expenditure. I think, however, that he will absolve us from any want of prevision when I tell him that our object is to hasten on the erection of this building in order that we may provide library accommodation for the Patent Office, and thereby set free a sum of &#x00A3;700 a year now paid for the use of a temporary
<image src="S4V0090P0I0201"/>
<col>167</col>
library. The lease for the temporary library terminates this year, and if we are unable, to give up the premises we may have to renew it. Then there was a question raised with regard to the Royal Mint. That item is required by a slight addition which is required by the Mint authorities. With regard to Hertford House, the supplementary sum is for extra furniture which is desired by the trustees and which was not contemplated when the original estimate was prepared. Having regard to the enormous value to this country of this collection, I hope the Committee will not grudge this money, especially when the great taste shown by the trustees in the preparation of the building is considered. Then I was asked about the War Office accommodation. The supplementary sum is explained by the necessity of acquiring a fresh office in consequence of the very large amount of work which has been thrown on the War Office during the past year. I should like to point out that this expenditure will tend towards the concentration of the clerks and the offices of the Department. I do not know whether it will surprise hon. Members when I tell them that only last year the War Office was working under no less than seventeen different roofs, some of them a mile apart.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CHARITABLE AGENCIES FOR THE<lb/> RELIEF OF WIDOWS AND ORPHANS<lb/> OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00829">Commons Message considered (according to Order).</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00830"><member>*THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR (LORD RAGLAN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I beg to move the motion standing in my name.<lb/>
Moved, "That this House do concur in the following resolution communicated by the Commons&#x2014;namely, 'That it is expedient that a Joint Committee of Lords and Commons be appointed to consider the various charitable agencies now in operation, and the funds available for relieving widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors, with a view to insuring that the funds subscribed by local and private benevolence are applied to the best advantage in supplementing a scheme of Government Pensions for widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors who have lost their lives in war.'" &#x2014;(<i>Lord Raglan.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00831"><member>EARL SPENCER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think the noble Lord is pursuing rather an unusual course in moving this motion without giving the House the slightest explanation. I want to know what is the object of this Committee. This matter has been before the public for a
<image src="S4V0090P0I0204"/>
<col>173</col>
great many years, particularly in connection with the Patriotic Fund, though since the Transvaal War it has come more into prominence as a result of the generous contributions which have been made to various funds in various parts of the country. Almost all the benevolent funds for the relief of those connected with the war have had large sums of money to distribute, and there has been a very strong feeling as to whether or not overlapping and abuse have followed in consequence. Though, of course, I may make some conjectures, I am quite at a loss to know what the object of this Committee is. I am not going to say a word in condemnation of the way the Patriotic Fund has been administered. All I will say is that I know it has not inspired confidence in the country; but at the same time I believe there has been a great deal of misrepresentation. As far as I can make out, there have been six or seven inquiries already of this kind. There was a Committee, over which my lamented friend the late Lord Herschell presided, in 1895; there was a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1896; there was a Committee of the Commissioners themselves, presided over by my noble and learned friend Lord Davey, who I regret to see is not in his place to-day; there was the Committee appointed by His Majesty the King, then Prince of Wales; and the last Committee was the one held lately under the able chairmanship of Lord Justice Collins, and on which my noble friend Lord North-brook served. These Committees all made Reports, and finally there was a conference in the City, under the presidency of the ex-Lord Mayor (Sir Alfred Newton), when some important resolutions were carried in order to give effect to the different recommendations that were made by Lord Justice Collins's Committee. Is this Committee to go over all the old ground again? We have heard a great deal recently of committees and commissions, and I confess I am rather shy of them, for they often delay action which it is necessary should be taken. It was only a few nights ago that the noble Marquess at the head of the Government protested that, if a Committee was granted to my noble friend Lord Avebury on the subject of hours in shops, it must not be thought that the Government would be bound to follow the advice of any committee, although that
<col>174</col>
advice would have a considerable amount of weight. With regard to the Patriotic Fund, inquiry has been made <i>ad nauseam</i>; but possibly it is not for that purpose that this Committee is to meet. I notice that the terms of reference speak of a scheme which I should hail with great satisfaction&#x2014;namely, a scheme of Government pensions for widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors who have lost their lives in war. We have not heard anything of that in this House, but it was one of the recommendations of Lord Justice Collins's Committee, and I suppose the Government have accepted it. It does not seem to me at all necessary to have a Committee to decide how the different funds are to be applied in supplementing such a scheme. The Government have already all the necessary information; and therefore, without wishing to oppose the noble Lord's motion, I think the House is entitled to some explanation with regard to it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00832"><member>*LORD RAGLAN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I can only refer the noble Earl to what has been said on this subject in another place. It is proposed by the Government to start a scheme under which the widows and orphans of men who have lost their lives in the service of the country shall receive pensions out of public funds. That being so, the position of these funds, which have hitherto been the means of supporting them, will be changed, and they will become auxiliary. It is therefore necessary to devise some scheme for dealing with them. I am afraid that is all the information I can give the noble Earl on the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00833"><member>*THE EARL OF NORTHBROOK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I was a member of Lord Justice Collins's Committee, and I concur in what has fallen from the noble Earl (Lord Spencer) on this subject. I cannot understand how the Government should think it necessary to appoint a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament to deal with a matter on which every single piece of information that can possibly be produced is before them. I also agree with my noble friend that, the House of Commons having asked for the appointment of a Committee, it would be ungracious to decline. But I wish that the noble Lord who represents the War Office in this House had been able to inform us what the scheme of pensions is which the Government are going to pro-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0205"/>
<col>175</col>
pose for the widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors who lose their lives in the service. Unless that scheme is notified beforehand, it would be perfectly useless for this Committee to undertake its labours. The whole of the future arrangements must depend upon what the amount of the pensions to be given by the Government is, and how far those pensions will extend; and unless that information is before the Joint Committee, I hold that the Joint Committee had very much better not meet. However, while associating myself with the observations made by the noble Earl with respect to the want of necessity for appointing this Committee, I am not prepared to oppose the appointment of the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00834"><member>*LORD WELBY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, as an individual member of the Patriotic Fund Commission, I should like to say that I have heard with great interest and satisfaction the statement made by the noble Lord the Under Secretary of State for War with regard to the scheme of Government pensions for the widows and orphans of soldiers and sailors. That is an entirely new departure, and, as the noble Lord said, it makes the voluntary funds upon which we have hitherto relied supplementary. The noble Lord's motion has the assent of the Patriotic Fund Commissioners, and I trust that the appointment of this Joint Committee will lead to a satisfactory arrangement. But I think it would assist the Committee very much if the Government were able to indicate in some form or other the lines on which they think that arrangement should be based.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00835">On Question, agreed to; and message ordered to be sent to the Commons to acquaint them therewith.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-00836">House adjourned at a quarter before Five of the clock, to Monday next, a quarter before Eleven of the clock.</p>

There is not any difficulty experienced in obtaining sufficient men of both these ratings on existing terms. During a great part of the year restrictions have been placed on recruiting in order to keep within the numbers voted and to ensure the entry of only specially desirable men. The Admiralty caused advertisements to be inserted in two papers only&#x2014;namely, <i>The Engineer and Engineering</i>&#x2014;in December last for candidates for assistant engineers for temporary service in the Navy. Several applications were received, but only three were accepted as suitable. These three passed the required examination and were entered in the service. No alteration of a special nature is at present contemplated in the condition of service of engineers, but with a view to any improvement which is desirable in the best interests of the Navy, these officers, in common with all others, have their conditions of service always under consideration at the Admiralty.</membercontribution></p>

As to the time between London and Paris and London and Berlin, he has had the telegrams of the 26th examined. The wires on that day were working well, and he finds that for the twenty-four hours the average time from the handing in of the messages at the counter to their receipt at the place of destination was thirty-two minutes in the case of Paris and thirty-five in the case of Berlin. In the busiest hours the time was longer, especially in the case of Berlin, where, however, he hopes to improve matters by the laying of an additional cable which is now being manufactured.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-00936"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: Auxiliary sorters are not required to sort at the rate mentioned. That rate has for many years past been regarded as the test of efficiency for the established sorting staff, but it has not hitherto been exacted from the auxiliaries. No penalty for inefficiency in sorting on the part of these auxiliaries has been imposed. It has been reported, however, that serious inconvenience involving delay to correspondence was being caused by the slow and incorrect sorting of some of them,
<col>194</col>
and steps have been taken by means of additional teaching and practice to afford them an opportunity for improvement. If it should be found, however, that, notwithstanding these facilities, any auxiliary sorter is unable to attain to a reasonable proficiency, it may become necessary to dispense with his services.</membercontribution></p>

<title>CIVIL SERVICE (SUPPLEMENTARY) ESTIMATES, 1900&#x2013;1901.</title>
<section>
<title>Class I.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01046">I. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;35,200, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, in respect of sundry public buildings in Great Britain, not provided for on other Votes."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01047"><member>*SIR WALTER FOSTER <memberconstituency>(Derbyshire, Ilkeston)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he thought that the right hon. Gentleman who was speaking the preceding evening when the House adjourned had given a somewhat remarkable explanation in dealing with the question of the Census buildings. It would be recollected that he declared the buildings had been enlarged in consequence of the increased staff which had been necessitated by the alterations made in the form of the Census Returns. Now, he did not think that that adequately explained the additional Vote which was being asked for. The alterations made in the form of the census were comparatively small, and yet the Committee was asked for a supplementary sum of &#x00A3;2,100 in addition to the &#x00A3;4,000 voted last year. The Supplementary Estimate represented, in fact, over half of the original Estimate. The increase could not be accounted for by the removal of the very inconvenient buildings in Charles Street, Whitehall, which were used when the last census was taken. Undoubtedly those buildings were not suited to the purposes to which they were applied, and he was very sorry indeed that the money now voted was not to be used for providing proper accommodation for tin; clerks. The buildings were made of galvanised iron lined with wood and other materials, and bearing in mind that much of the work had to be done at a period of the year when great heat prevailed, it was clear that those engaged upon it had to
<col>212</col>
labour under conditions injurious to their health and detrimental to the efficiency of their work. Now, these old buildings were simply to be removed from one site to another, and a further building of the same type was to be provided for the fifty additional female clerks who were to be employed in the compilation of the census. In this matter he did not think they got good value for their money, and, in view of the enormous expenditure to which this country was committed for war purposes, he did feel that it was the duty of every Member to watch the Estimates very closely in order to see that at any rate the money was not wasted. Would it not have been better for the right hon. Gentleman, in framing the Estimate, to have considered whether the money could not have been spent more usefully, cither in hiring a better building, or by making a beginning by way of providing permanent offices for census purposes? It seemed to him a very dangerous piece of economy to use buildings of that kind for the storage of documentary evidence in view of the danger of destruction by fire. A wooden house covered with galvanised iron was certainly not a suitable place in which to keep public documents collected at the cost of such enormous expenditure and trouble. It seemed to him that they were by no means getting value for their money, for the only return they were apparently to have for the additional estimate of &#x00A3;2,100 was the removal of three or four iron buildings from one place to another and the provision of an additional one. He really could not understand how so much money could be spent on the work, and he was driven to the conclusion that this particular Estimate afforded one more illustration of the miscalculations of which the framers of the various estimates had been guilty. He thought they were entitled to some explanation in regard to that, as well as in respect of the large Supplementary Vote asked for in connection with Hertford House and the Imperial institute. The case of the Imperial Institute and the London University was an equally remarkable instance. In the last Estimates &#x00A3;8,770 were voted for the adaptation of the buildings for use by the London University, and now no less than &#x00A3;9,960 addi-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0224"/>
<col>213</col>
tional were asked for. Surely &#x00A3;18,000 was a large amount for adapting the buildings for the use of the university. Even if preparations were being made for a teaching university, the original estimate ought at any rate to have been much nearer the amount actually required. The London University would also come up under another Vote in regard to the preparation of a laboratory which was necessary for carrying on the examining purposes of the university. Then there was an additional Vote of &#x00A3;3,000 for the Patent Office. All these matters indicated a laxity of circulation which ought not to exist in public-affairs. Any private firm which carried on its business under such conditions would soon be in a condition of bankruptcy. In these times when, considering the burden the country was likely to have to bear in the near future, economy ought to be the great consideration in connection with public expenditure, he felt hound to call the attention of the Committee to these points.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01048"><member>*SIR ALBERT ROLLIT <memberconstituency>(Islington, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> remarked that, with regard to the Imperial Institute, many of the acts which had had to be done were not discovered to be necessary until the University moved into the buildings. One of the chief objects of the reorganisation had been to make the University a teaching body, and for that purpose many rooms, though perhaps not exactly class-rooms at present, were required for the examination of both the internal and external students and for the enlarged work contemplated on the part of the University. But however much the Vote had been, there were still one or two things urgently required to lie done. The sanitary arrangements were not at all satisfactory, and in the case of the large hall for examinations the ventilation was so bad as to be a positive disadvantage to the students who were examined. Not only the University, but also the Civil Service candidates were affected by this, as they were examined in the same building, and for such occasions the conditions ought to be made as suitable as possible, as the tenure of this hall by the University had been an express condition of the removal to South Kensington, which had been very re-
<col>214</col>
luctantly consented to by himself and other members of the Senate. There was also a question of fees and payments to examiners at present between the Senate and the Treasury, and if the latter took the fees to the end of the financial year, it ought to bear all expenses to the same date, in order that the University might start clear with the not too liberal grant which was suggested. The attempt to get back the large hall primarily for the Civil Service, as a condition of the proposed new grant, would be very strongly resisted by the Senate. The chemical laboratory was also badly ventilated, and this should be attended to without delay.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01049"><member>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE <memberconstituency>(Wexford, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> pointed out, as a matter in which many Members were interested, that no provision was made in the census arrangements for a religious census. He did not agree with the complaint with regard to the money spent in arrangements for the housing of the Wallace collection. It was not easy to spend too much money on housing works of art. He congratulated the British public on having obtained this magnificent collection, but regretted that some of the pictures were not given to Ireland, seeing that very large estates, known as the Wallace Estates, used to be held in Ireland, from, the rental of which estates, he imagined, a good deal of the money which purchased these pictures was provided. With regard to the adaptation of the Imperial Institute for the London University, he quite agreed that these buildings should be made convenient and comfortable for the people who used them. The Vote, however, would not excite much sympathy on the Irish benches, seeing that it provided nearly &#x00A3;10,000 practically as an endowment of a university in England, where there were so many universities, whereas a university for Irish Catholics was denied. If for no other reason he would challenge a division on this Vote as a protest against the continued neglect of Ireland in the matter of university education. As to the Supplementary Vote for the introduction and extension of electric lighting in public buildings in England, he hoped it would lead to a similar introduction in the public buildings of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01051"><member>THE FIRST COMMISSIONER of WORKS (Mr. AKERS DOUGLAS, <memberconstituency>Kent, St. Augustine's</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> explained that the complaint was that no particulars were given on the paper in regard to anything except items appearing under subhead "A," to which he replied that it had always been the practice, not only in Supplemental Estimates but also in the original Estimates, to give the new works under subhead "A" in full, while the others were in general terms.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01052"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON</member><membercontribution> was sorry he misunderstood the right hon. Gentleman. The rule was all very well when there were very few Supplementary Estimates or none at all, but there were now an unprecedented number, and it was only right and just that the information which had been given across the table should have been printed on the Estimates themselves. The reply on some of the points to which the previous evening ho (the speaker) directed attention was inadequate and unsatisfactory. The expenditure for extensions of the War Office, being due to the pressure of the war, was properly made the subject of a Supplementary Estimate, because in the ordinary way it could not be foreseen, especially by the present Government. The argument with regard to the Census buildings was that since the original estimate was voted it had been determined to obtain further information in the census, involving a certain amount of
<col>216</col>
additional expenditure. What were the alterations which would increase the cost by no less than one-third of the original sum? There was a great deal of force in the contention that with such large expenditure there should be something in the nature of a permanent building rather than a tin house, which was not only useless in the future, but dangerous to health. As to the &#x00A3;3,000 extra for the Patent Office extension, it was said that that was to provide library accommodation. If there was one thing more than another which might have been anticipated, or in which there was no possible urgency for a few months, surely it was the provision of library accommodation for the Patent Office. This was another illustration of the absolute laxity prevailing in regard to the Estimates, and of the manner in which, very largely in consequence of their strength in the House, the Government were able and willing to allow things to be done, but in which, if their majority was smaller, they would never dare to present them to the House. There was another item for the erection of a new Die and Medal Department. Was that a matter of urgent necessity? The right hon. Gentleman did not argue that point, and therefore he did not see that he had any right to put it in the form of a Supplementary Estimate. He said nothing in regard to the very large expenditure upon electric lighting, and that was a matter which ought to be provided in the original Estimate, and which might have stood over for the new Estimates. The right hon. Gentleman did not say anything in regard to the general proposition which was discussed last night as to why these Supplementary Estimates should be of such an enormous amount, covering a larger number of Votes&#x2014;twenty-nine, with seventy-six sub-divisions&#x2014;than any other previous Supplementary Estimates, lie thought they were entitled to have some information from the Government why it was that there had been this laxity in regard to the Estimates, and if there had been a long discussion in regard to these different items the fault was entirely with the Government themselves. If this Supplementary Estimate had been introduced with proper information it would have been passed last night. They had to drag their information from the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0226"/>
<col>217</col>
right hon. Gentleman across the floor of the House, and that was the reason why this prolonged discussion had taken place, and he hoped it would continue until they got fuller information in regard to those matters.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01053"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: With regard to the general charge made by the hon. Member who has just sat down, regarding the want of information, that is a matter which does not devolve upon me. I am not responsible for the preparation of the Supplementary Estimates as a whole, but I am responsible for those items which come more particularly under my management.<lb/>
As to the question raised by the hon. Member opposite in regard to the Census buildings. I gave an explanation last night which I am sorry he did not think entirely satisfactory. I pointed out that this excess was caused because when in 1899&#x2013;90 this Estimate for the Census buildings was prepared, it was thought that the buildings which had been sufficient for the staff which conducted the last census would have been sufficient upon the present occasion. Since that amount was estimated the temporary buildings had been moved, and it was found that additional accommodation was required, especially for the female staff. In addition to that, in order to meet many of the objections which the hon. Member so justly pointed out with regard to the nature of the buildings, and at the request of the Registrar General, we spent money on the extra ventilation of these buildings, and fitting them with the electric light, which makes them much healthier to work in. We have, therefore, done something to meet the requirements of the people who work in those buildings, and in regard to the electric light it was not foreseen that an installation of this light would be required.<lb/>
With regard to providing permanent buildings for the census, that is a very much larger question, and it is one on which I do not think the hon. Member will find I am at all averse to placing myself in line with him. That, however, is a question which we need not discuss at any length to-day, for the hon. Member has found an answer to it himself on the present occasion, for he has stated
<col>218</col>
that we are spending too much money already. In the near future I should be glad to see some permanent buildings provided for the census.<lb/>
The hon. Gentleman asked me a question with regard to the adaptation of Hertford House for the Wallace collection. This expenditure was incurred in order to hasten on the work, and I could not possibly have foreseen this in the the preparation of the Estimate. Neither my Department nor myself are responsible for the administration of Hertford House, for we have only to deal with the structural alterations of the building. The extra work at Hertford House was asked for by the trustees who administer that building in so excellent a manner, but they are not under my jurisdiction. A request was made for this further work to be proceeded with at once in order that no delay might take place, and that the public should have the earliest opportunity of visiting the collection. The hon. Member for North Wexford complained that none of these pictures had been sent to Ireland, but perhaps he will remember that the bequest provides that the collection must be kept in London, and therefore it is not within the power of the Government to accede to the hon. Member's request.<lb/>
Some remarks have been made in regard to the necessity of a Patent Office Library, and it is said that that charge might have been anticipated. I made an answer to that point last night. The additional sum spent to complete the buildings was incurred because we were specially desirous of hastening on this work in order to save, as far as possible, the &#x00A3;700 a year which is the rent being-paid for a temporary home for the library while these alterations were going on. By this expenditure of &#x00A3;3,000 we shall be able to make the library complete, and transfer the books from the temporary home, thus relieving the country of an expenditure of some &#x00A3;700 a year for three years. Therefore I think it was well worth while incurring this expenditure to hurry the adaptation of the building, in order to avoid the necessity of taking on another lease for three years of this temporary home at a rental of &#x00A3;700 per annum.<lb/>
With regard to the alterations and arrangements at Cleveland House, I
<image src="S4V0090P0I0227"/>
<col>219</col>
think the hon. Member expressed himself satisfied with the explanation I have already given. This expenditure was necessary in consequence of the increase of the War Office staff, and this could not possibly have been foreseen in December, when the Estimates were prepared. The same argument will also apply to the introduction and the extension of the electric light at Cleveland House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01054"><member>MR. FIELD <memberconstituency>(Dublin. St. Patrick's)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked if the First Commissioner of Works would give them an explanation of the "Imperial Institute, London University," item. He thought that required some explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01055"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: The reason for this excess on the Imperial Institute has really been given by my hon. friend below me. It is really impossible in the transfer of a great institution like the London University into fresh quarters to foresee what would be required by that institution. The chief items of expenditure have been for certain structural alterations with regard to a new entrance and providing other rooms that had to be found in substitution for the rooms which were taken over by the London University. In addition there has been some unforeseen expenditure with regard to the library, and I think the Committee will agree with me that in moving a very large library like this it is almost impossible to forecast what the cost will be. I am bound to say that a large amount of this expenditure has taken place in regard to the sanitary arrangements of the new home of the London University. I agree with him that not nearly enough sanitary requirements have been provided for; and the question of the health of those who use the building is a subject which will probably be discussed when we come to the Estimates on a future occasion. But in regard to the charge that there has been any want of foresight in the planning of the additions to these buildings, I may say that they were not designed by the Government expert, but by the very distinguished and worthy architect of the original Imperial Institute, Mr. Collcutt. It is not so easy for the Department to make any accurate estimate when they do not carry out the work themselves. Some of the require-
<col>220</col>
ments of the London University were not known to us until late last year. I do not blame the University officials, because until they were able to overhaul their books, maps, etc., they were not in a position to estimate exactly the expenditure of reinstating them. I think I have met, so far as I can, the inquiries that have been made in regard to this particular Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01056"><member>*MR. TENNANT <memberconstituency>(Berwickshire)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the right hon. Gentleman had not mentioned, although careful attention had been given to his remarks, anything in regard to the condition of the Census buildings. The right hon. Gentleman had stated that the House had demanded that certain alterations should be made in the form of the Census Returns, and that, therefore, additional clerks would lie required. They must all rejoice that the right hon. Gentleman was going to make it a rule that the clerks would work-under more sanitary conditions than at the last census. He wished that the First Commissioner of Works would give the Committee some information as to the particular alterations he intended to make.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01057"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution> said that this was a Building Vote, and he did not think that the work done by the clerks of the Registrar General could be discussed under it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01058"><member>*MR. TENNANT</member><membercontribution> said hon. Members were entitled to inquire whether additional rooms were, required for the lady clerks, or whether additional rooms and clerks were required at all. That was his first point; but his next was that it seemed to him rather peculiar that under subhead F there should be an increase of &#x00A3;1.200 for the supply of water. Surely that was a matter that obviously ought to have been foreseen by any Government Department.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01059"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution> said that the additional expenditure was due to new boilers for the engines which forced the supply of water, and not for the supply of water in the ordinary course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01060"><member>*MR. TENNANT</member><membercontribution>: What about the clerks?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0228"/>
<col>221</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01061"><member>MR. AKERS DOUGLAS</member><membercontribution>: I will find out, but that does not come within my Department.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01062"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL <memberconstituency>(Longford, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said this Vote of &#x00A3;35,200 seemed a very large sum, and the different heads under which it was set out showed certainly a very extraordinary want of foresight on the part of the officials, whoever they were, who had made out the original Estimate. For New Works. Alterations, and Additions, the sum of &#x00A3;21,000 was the extra amount required. Of course, it might be necessary for architects to make variations on their plans from time to time, but it was an extraordinary thing that such a very large sum had not been contemplated in the original Estimate. It was most unfortunate if the Government desired to get the Votes through that they did not give any particulars whatever to the Committee. He quite appreciated the kindly and civil manner in which the right hon. the First Commissioner of Works had sought to meet every point raised, although he must say the right hon. Gentleman seemed rather disposed to ignore questions from the Irish benches, and to give a preference to complaints made above the gangway. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would be convinced in time that they on the Irish benches made their complaints <i>bona fide,</i> because he must know that every portion of the country was drawn upon to supply the money which was now being asked for, and that, therefore, the Irish representatives were as greatly interested in money matters as those from the other parts of the United Kingdom. It should not be forgotten that one-eleventh of the whole contributions to the Exchequer came from Ireland, and they had to complain that no sufficient ground whatever had been shown for the huge increase in expenditure, particularly at a time when they were every day adding to the enormous debt of the British Empire. Of course, under this Vote he was not allowed to refer to the increase of debt due to the war in South Africa, which was being piled up at the rate of two millions a week, but he would point out that the cost of home administration was also increasing to an alarming extent, and it was time that full details should be given before
<col>222</col>
they allowed the Votes to pass through Committee. There was one particular in the Vote with which Irishmen had very grave cause of complaint. They were handing over the Imperial Institute to the London University, and were spending &#x00A3;9,960 for the purpose of converting it to university uses. There was not a single Vote which ought to be more objectionable to Irishmen than that one. The vast majority of the people of Ireland were Catholics, and had asked over and over again that provision might be made for the establishment of a Catholic University in Ireland. Not only had their appeals fallen on deaf ears, but they had been met with contempt and scorn. Here was a large public building in London which, he understood, had been erected, not by voluntary or public contribution, or by the taxpayers of Great Britain, but by the free gift of the people of India to commemorate the Queens Jubilee in 1887. This large building was to be handed to the London University, and the taxpayers of Ireland were not only to be deprived of the Catholic University in Ireland, but to be called upon at the same time to pay their due proportion of the fitting up of the building for London University purposes. That was another illustration of the manner in which Irish claims were dealt with, and if on no other ground, he would resist the Vote. Ho trusted his friends on the Irish benches would seek to drive this point home more forcibly, for it was really a scandal that a Catholic University was not given to them in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01063"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Gentleman is now discussing a subject that he himself has admitted is out of order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01064"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL</member><membercontribution> said there were other items on this Vote on which he wished for some information. &#x00A3;2,000 was asked on account of alterations to adapt Winchester House for the Intelligence Branch. He wanted to know what the intelligence was about. Was it in connection with the war in South Africa, or for what other purpose? On the whole, ho must say the Government had drawn very largely on the credulity of Irish Members in asking them to agree to a Vote of &#x00A3;35,200
<image src="S4V0090P0I0229"/>
<col>223</col>
without giving them any details. There was a sum of &#x00A3;3,125 for the adaptation of Hertford House for the Wallace Collection. Not a solitary picture frame from that collection was to come to Ireland. He wondered if hon. Members knew that a very large portion of the estate of the late Sir Richard Wallace was situated in the north of Ireland. There was no doubt that some of the art treasures accumulated by Sir Richard Wallace had been purchased by the money which he derived from his estates in Ireland. Of course they had no right to insist on the Government breaking the terms of the bequest. He knew himself there were always plenty of legal difficulties to be raised about the simplest questions, but, at the same time, when they were asked to vote these large sums of money without any details, it was only fair that proper opportunities should be given them to call attention to the differential treatment, if he might so term it which was accorded to London and to Ireland. Some of the replies given by the right hon. Gentleman were, in his opinion, most unsatisfactory; and on three several items which he had endeavoured to explain he had to admit that the headings and details were misleading. He complained that although the sum asked for showed an increase of nearly fifty per cent, in one of the items, on the original Estimate, the details and particulars given were of a very meagre character, and the accounts as presented to the Committee were not satisfactory, at all events so far as he was concerned. One to which he took particular exception was the item dealing with the alterations at Winchester House, in order to adapt it for the occupation of the Intelligence Branch. If it was intended to make this a sort of appanage of the War Office Department, he thought the Committee would be wrong to pass it, for of all things, that the War Office had hopelessly broken down was most patent to the country, lie moved to reduce the Vote by the sum of &#x00A3;2,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01065">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;33,200, be granted for the said Service."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Farrell.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01066"><member>SIR BRAMPTON GURDON <memberconstituency>(Norfolk, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> asked for information with
<col>224</col>
regard to the nature of the alterations said to be required in Winchester House. According to his experience of the public service, it was a common trick of new officials to find fault with their room, to say, for example, that it was too small, and to ask the Office of Works to knock-two or three rooms into one. Then, after a time, another new official would come in and say the room was too large, and ask the Office of Works to put up the party walls again, and incur the whole expense of restoring the place to the same condition as before. He hoped the right hon. Gentleman would show a stiff front to all such demands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01067"><member>MR. BOLAND <memberconstituency>(Kerry, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> supported the reduction, as in his opinion it was only proper when the Government brought forward a Supplementary Estimate of this kind they should give full particulars of how the money was to be expended. It had been said it was impossible to put down a complete Estimate in this ease, because it was drawn up originally in 1899; but if that were so, it was all the more important that complete details should be given now, as only those who had the opportunity of hearing the explanations were in a position to form a judgment. He thought it would be greatly to the advantage of Members of the Committee if full details were given of these Estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01068"><member>MR. O'DOHERTY <memberconstituency>(Donegal, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> considered the explanation given, by the right hon. Gentleman the First Commissioner of Works was one that could not be accepted by the Irish Members. Upon one item&#x2014;"fuel, light, and household articles"&#x2014;he would like to draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to the merits of compressed peat. That was a matter worth considering at a time when coal-owners were putting up the prices, and did not allow the workmen to participate in rooking the public. The right hon. Gentleman might try the use of peat as an experiment, at all events, and he would find that he would not only save the public funds, but would be the means of developing a very large industry in Ireland. With regard to the amount required for the erection of a new-die and medal department at the Royal

<col>225</col>
Mint, he would suggest, if it was intended to build a now department for the striking of medals for those who had taken part in the war, that there should also be a tannery attached to it, as most of the officers at the war and the whole of</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01072">Original Question again proposed.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01073"><member>MR. GODDARD <memberconstituency>(Ipswich)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he thought they had some cause of complaint in regard to this Supplementary Estimate, inasmuch as there was a very large proportion of it which still remained absolutely without any explanation whatever. Mo doubt there were times when there were exigencies which caused the
<col>228</col>
original Estimates to be exceeded, and they must pass Supplementary Estimates to make up the required amount. The practice had been growing to make these Supplementary Estimates for large sums of money, which could not be regarded as the result of a mistake in the original Estimate. The reason for this seemed to be a little difficult to understand. It either meant that there was great in-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0232"/>
<col>229</col>
competency on the part of those who prepared the Estimates in submitting a smaller amount than was really required, or else it must mean that the Government were afraid to put in the original Estimate the full amount required for the various Departments, and hoped to smuggle through the extra amount in the Supplementary Estimates, which were not fully explained. That was very unsatisfactory indeed, and he thought it was the duty of the House of Commons to resist the attempts which were made to remove these Estimates from the fullest investigation. This item of &#x00A3;35,200 was no small amount. It was a large amount, and there was only &#x00A3;31,000 attempted to be explained. He admitted that the right hon. Gentleman had given some explanation which might justify the increased expenditure, but it did not seem that he was justified in putting it in a Supplementary Estimate. He thought that might have been brought up in a proper way. Was it right that the Committee should be asked to pass a large sum of money like this without a single word of explanation before them? In regard to the sum of &#x00A3;14,200 he had before asked an explanation, but the right hon. Gentleman had not vouchsafed any. He noticed that in one case &#x00A3;5,500 was set down for rents, insurance, and tithe rent-charges. The Government must fully know what they had to pay, and the Committee ought to have an explanation why the amount was not included in the original Estimate. He had no doubt that the extra expenditures were absolutely correct, but the Committee had no knowledge of them, and it was possible, as he showed on the previous night, even in such a homely thing as furniture, to crowd in things which wore not furniture at all, and which called forth comment from the Comptroller and Auditor General. It was part of their duty to try to prevent the forcing of Estimates through the House without getting a full and proper explanation of them. He moved that the Vote be reduced by &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01074">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;35,100, be granted for the said Service."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Goddard.</i>)</p>
<col>230</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01075"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution> supported the proposal to reduce the Vote. He believed the system which had now been adopted with regard to the Supplementary Estimates was altogether wrong. The Government objected to supplementary questions, but they certainly had no objection to Supplementary Estimates. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House had obtained an Order objecting to supplementary questions being asked on foreign affairs, but the hon. Member thought they should also have an Order in regard to Supplementary Estimates. In this Vote there was an increase of no less than one-tenth of the whole amount. The total was &#x00A3;350,000 and the Supplementary Estimate was &#x00A3;35,000. He held that, if any business man conducted his affairs in the same way that the financial affairs of this Empire were conducted, he would simply be bankrupt in a very short time. Hon. Members got the Supplementary Estimates the day before they came to be considered. That was not a businesslike way of dealing with these matters. He would support the reduction of the Vote as a protest against a system which, in his opinion, was being abused not only by this Government, but by every Government which had been in power since he came into the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01076"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES <memberconstituency>(Lynn Regis)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he had again and again called attention to the practice of bringing enormous Supplementary Estimates before the Committee, and more than three years ago he was assured by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that they had seen the last of this mischievous system. He had drawn the attention of the Government not only to the inconvenience of the practice, but also to the absolute destruction of our system of national accounts which it involved. Supplementary Estimates ought to be jealously avoided when it was in any way possible. They ought to be jealously kept for occasions which, could not possibly be foreseen when the original Estimates were made. When the practice of introducing Supplementary Estimates was seen to be growing year after year, it was calculated to produce the impression that there was a sot purpose of interfering with the control of the House of Commons. He
<image src="S4V0090P0I0233"/>
<col>231</col>
did not know who might be responsible for this method of false finance, but it was a system of falsifying the accounts, because when the Chancellor of the Exchequer produced his Budget and told the House he required a certain amount of money for the expenditure of the year, it was an outrage that he should come afterwards and ask for five or six millions more. He earnestly hoped the Government would give serious attention to this matter, and in future years refrain from calling upon the Committee to consider as Supplementary Estimates matters which really and properly belonged to the original Estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01077"><member>MR. POWER <memberconstituency>(Waterford, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that year after year it had been the practice of the Government to endeavour to take these Votes from the review of the Committee. First they came for Votes on Account, and then they brought in Supplementary Estimates. If the officials of the House knew that they could get a, Supplementary Vote on this and that item they became very careless in the manner they framed their Estimates, and the Ministers in charge of the Votes, knowing that if they sat tight until twelve o'clock the discussion would close, were not nearly so careful as they used to be in regard to explanations. When the rules providing for the closure of Supply were first introduced, Mr. Courtney said that one of the certain results would be negligence on the part of Departments in making up their accounts, and, to a certain extent, negligence on the part of Ministers in charge of defending the Votes, and he predicted a large increase of Votes on Account and also of Supplementary Estimates. The same thing was predicted by the Irish Members, and events had justified the prediction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01078"><member>*SIR EDGAR VINCENT <memberconstituency>(Exeter)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> desired to add his protest against the system of finance which led to these very large Supplementary Estimates. In looking through the details of the Vote under discussion he could not see any item which should not have been foreseen when the original Estimate was prepared, or which could not have been postponed until the Estimates of the current year; and those were the only grounds upon which the inclusion
<col>232</col>
of any item with a Supplementary Vote could be justified. Taking the figures of the last ten years, he found that the amount of Supplementary Votes on the Civil Service Estimates was decidedly upon the increase. It was not a party question, and he hoped the Government would take a firm stand in future against the system, as it was greatly in the interests of financial government that it should he done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01079"><member>THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO THE TREASURY (Mr. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN <memberconstituency>Worcestershire, E.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said that, with regard to the general question of Supplementary Estimates, there seemed to be an impression in various parts of the Committee that they were a convenience to the Government. That certainly was not the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01080"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the contention was that they were a convenience to the permanent officials.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01081"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> assured the Committee that it was the desire of the Government to limit Supplementary Estimates as strictly as possible. In recent years there had been, as the hon. Member for Exeter had pointed out. a tendency to increase the Supplementary Estimates, but it would he his duty, and it was the desire of the Government, to limit them as strictly as they could in future. The circumstances under which the Estimates were framed were well known to right hon. Gentlemen opposite; they were drawn up a long while beforehand, and it was impossible in all cases to foresee all the expenditure. With regard to the remark of the hon. Member for East Mayo, that the permanent officials preferred Supplementary Estimates to the ordinary Estimates of the year, he thought there was no foundation for such a suggestion. Many of the Votes under discussion were Votes which could not possibly have been introduced at an earlier time. In the circumstances of the present year there had been peculiar conditions, which had upset calculations made with as great an approach to accuracy as was possible at the time the original Estimates were framed. The Committee doubtless would recognise the exceptional circum-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0234"/>
<col>233</col>
stances of the year, and understand that the fact of there being so large a sum to be obtained by Supplementary Estimates was not an indication of any desire or intention on the part of the Government to increase Supplementary Estimates unnecessarily.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01082"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE <memberconstituency>(Northampton)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> thought the Amendment was moved as a general protest against the growing system of Supplementary Estimates. The objection was not to those matters which could not have been foreseen; there were no doubt such cases, but when the Supplementary Estimates kept increasing it was necessary to oppose every item that could not be shown to have been necessarily put in the form of a Supplementary Estimate. That was the only way in which the matter could be dealt with in a practical manner. The Financial Secretary had said that special care would be exercised in the future. Promises for "the future" were always being given. "The present" was now being dealt with, and if the Supplementary Estimates were reduced in the future it would be mainly due to the fact that they were opposed now. The real reason they had increased was that the Opposition had been very remiss in its duty. During the last Parliament Supplementary Estimates went up by leaps and bounds, because, instead of there being any real discussion upon them, the Opposition sat cowed and did not dare to do anything. They were going to adopt quite a different system in the present Parliament; they were going to fight the Government upon everything, because, although they were in a numerical minority at present, they represented the feelings of the country upon many questions in regard to finance, and they intended henceforth to do their duty. As no attempt at a case had been made for many of the present Supplementary Estimates, it was a very good opportunity to give the Government a hint of their intentions, which they were determined to carry out without fear of being accused of obstruction or anything of that sort.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01083"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> was glad that the Financial Secretary had admitted the
<col>234</col>
justice of the complaint against these Supplementary Estimates, and promised that the Government would amend its ways in the years to come. But that promise had been given every year for the last seven or eight years, and instead of there being any sign of improvement things had got worse. The great increase in Supplementary Estimates, which was a sign of recklessness, carelessness, and indifference in dealing with public accounts, was but a symptom of a disease which was playing havoc with the public economy that the House of Commons was supposed to enforce. The reason these constant increases were brought forward was that the opinion had been growing on the permanent officials that the day had gone by when the Committee would find fault with any Estimate that was submitted. The recent statement of the First Lord of the Treasury, that it was the accepted practice of the House of Commons not to discuss any Estimate with a view to economy, was a direct invitation to every official to be indifferent in his accounts, and to have no fear of the House of Commons before his eyes, knowing perfectly well that if he made up a wrong Estimate he could put forward a Supplementary Estimate. The system betokened a fatal disease which was preying upon the whole of the spending departments of the country, and which would sooner or later cause an outbreak on the part of that most patient of all beings, the taxpayer of the United Kingdom. It was for these reasons the Opposition had taken up the position they had on that and the previous day, and that course of action had been amply justified. The Amendment might now very well be voted upon, in order that other important Votes could be discussed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01084"><member>MR. MARTIN <memberconstituency>(Worcestershire, Droitwich)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> remarked that if Supplementary Estimates were to be done away with altogether the tendency would be for the original Estimates to be drawn up very loosely, and not at all so strictly as they should be. That was a danger which should be kept in view.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01085"><member>MR. GEORGE WHITELEY <memberconstituency>(Yorkshire, W.R., Pudsey)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> felt it necessary to join in the protest against the large
<image src="S4V0090P0I0235"/>
<col>235</col>
Supplementary Estimates the Committee were always called upon to meet at the end of the financial year, a large proportion of which might have been included in the original Estimates of the various Departments. The Minister in charge always said that it should not occur again, but year after year the same thing happened. It seemed to be entirely beyond the power of Ministers to treat those matters in a businesslike way. No private business could conduct its financial affairs in such a fashion. The continual growth of the expenditure of the country was a matter of the gravest concern. Year by year the Committee with a light heart voted largely increasing expenditure, the taxation of the country grew heavier, and millions were added to the burdens of the nation. These matters could not be attacked in the gross; they must be considered in detail with a determination to lop off everything that was unnecessary. Ministers themselves ought to be grateful for the protest which had been made, because it would strengthen their hands in battling against the leading officials of their Departments, and in keeping down the Estimates. The House of Commons was gradually losing its grip over the expenditure of the country, and how the Chancellor of the Exchequer looked forward to his annual statement he did not know. He did not believe the Treasury would take the Committee to be serious in its protests until some Vote had been refused, and he ventured to hope the division would be successful in bringing the matter home to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01086"><member>MR. HEYWOOD JOHNSTONE <memberconstituency>(Sussex, Horsham)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said there was no doubt the system of Supplementary Estimates was a very inconvenient one, and it was almost impossible for the House of Commons to keep a proper check on the expenditure of the country so long as the Committee were subject, after the Estimates had been more or less discussed, to demands for further large sums in the shape of Supplementary Estimates. At the same time, they could not do without Supplementary Estimates for unforeseen expenses. But a Public Accounts Committee sat during the session, and he would like to suggest that no Supplementary Estimate should be presented
<col>236</col>
to the House until it had been before that Committee. If that Committee investigated the figures, and satisfied themselves that the amounts asked for were such as should properly be embodied in Supplementary Estimates, the House might proceed to vote on such matters with much more confidence than at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01087"><member>*MR. JOHN ELLIS <memberconstituency>(Nottinghamshire, Rushcliffe)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> thought it would be very unfortunate if this important matter was regarded from a party point of view. The suggestion of the hon. Member for the Horsham Division would not bear much examination from the constitutional standpoint. The Government must be held responsible for the proposals it placed before the House of Commons, and he should not be at all in favour of delegating that responsibility to any Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01088"><member>MR. HEYWOOD JOHNSTONE</member><membercontribution> explained that he did not for a moment suggest that the House should accept the Estimates as sent down from the Public Accounts Committee, but simply that it would save a great deal of time if it was known that they had been thoroughly examined upstairs.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01089"><member>*MR. JOHN ELLIS</member><membercontribution> said that would not at all do away with the constitutional objection. The Government must be held responsible from beginning to end for the demands they put before the House, and the burdens they placed upon the taxpayers. The hon. Member would see upon consideration that his suggestion would be fatal to all fixing of responsibility. These Supplementary Estimates were against all financial security, but the practice of presenting them was undoubtedly growing. He welcomed the assurance of the Financial Secretary, but the hon. Member had not a long period of official experience behind him, and his assurance must therefore be taken for what it was worth. The spirit shown on that and the previous evening with regard to the Estimates had been too long absent from the debates, and he welcomed its return. Finance would dominate this session and this Parliament. For long, as was well known to anyone of Parliamentary experience, Ministers of the highest con-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0236"/>
<col>237</col>
stitutional and financial reputations had uttered their protest against the methods involved in large Supplementary Estimates.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01092">Original Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01093">2. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;13,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, for Rates and Contributions in
<col>240</col>
lieu of Rates, etc., in respect of Government property."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01094"><member>MR. CALDWELL <memberconstituency>(Lanarkshire, Mid)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said this was one of the opportunities the Government would have of defending the principle on which the Supplementary Estimates had been made out. He wished to know why they had lumped
<image src="S4V0090P0I0238"/>
<col>241</col>
the amount for England and Ireland' together, instead of dividing them into different heads, and why there had been no explanation given as to how much was for England and how much for Ireland. Could it be said for a moment that the money required for the rates on these properties could not have been foreseen? These properties did not come into existence yesterday or since the Estimates were made out. These buildings in London were in existence and occupation, and they could easily have taken into account in the original Estimate the amount that would be required to be paid. He noticed that they had inserted a foot-note which stated&#x2014;
<quote>"This additional sum is required to meet an increase in the poundage of rates in London and in many country districts; also in Ireland."</quote>
That argument might apply in the case of an individual, but in London the rates were under their own control and they were not like those levied by local authorities. The Government had their own valuers, and there could be no difficulty whatever in estimating the amount of those rates beforehand, lie washed to know how it was that these rates had been increased? Why was it that they had increased rates in respect to England and Ireland and yet they had no increase whatever as far as Scotland was concerned? In the ease of England in the year 1890 the amount required for rates and contributions in lieu of rates in respect of Government property was &#x00A3;250,800, for Scotland the amount was &#x00A3;20,500, and for Ireland &#x00A3;41,000. Five years later, when they came to last year's Estimates, they found that the rates in England amounted to &#x00A3;385,000, and this was a Supplementary Estimate in addition which would bring the sum total up to nearly &#x00A3;400,000 instead of the &#x00A3;250.800 at which it stood five years ago. That was an enormous increase. How did the matter stand with regard to Ireland? In the year 1890, in Ireland the amount for rates and contributions in lieu of rates in respect of Government property was &#x00A3;41,000. and last year there was a slight increase, the amount being &#x00A3;42,000 instead of &#x00A3;41,000, but that was owing to the operation of the
<col>242</col>
Local Government Act. Practically speaking, so far as Ireland was concerned, for the last five years there had not been the slightest increase. As far as Scotland was concerned, if they would look at the Appropriation Accounts they would find that Scotland only got &#x00A3;17,000, and under these accounts if there was a saving in one country it went to the other country, and England had been getting the benefit of what Scotland had saved. They ought to have a uniform principle of valuation for England, Scotland, and Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01095"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member is now going into the general question and he must be aware that that is not in order. He must confine himself to the subject-matter of the Estimate before the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01096"><member>MR. CALDWELL</member><membercontribution> said he was complaining, as he was quite entitled to complain, that the Government were coming to the House with Supplementary Estimates for England, whilst they had not found it necessary to make Supplementary Estimates for the other country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01097"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: That is not the point with which the hon. Member was dealing when I ruled him out of order. He was then going in to the general question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01098"><member>MR. CALDWELL</member><membercontribution> said that as regarded these rates they ought to have an account of the amount of valuation and the taxes of the Government property throughout England, giving the details. That would facilitate them very considerably in getting at the proportion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01099"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: As I have already pointed out to the hon. Member, this is a point with which he cannot deal. He is now discussing the general principle, and that cannot be discussed upon a Supplementary Estimate. The hon. Member must confine himself to this Estimate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01100"><member>MR. CALDWELL</member><membercontribution> contended that they were entitled to know how much of this
<image src="S4V0090P0I0239"/>
<col>243</col>
increased expenditure was due to increased poundage of rates, and the conditions under which this increase had been rendered necessary, and he would leave the matter in that form.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01101"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: This is one of those items which is not open to the criticism of which we have heard a good deal in the earlier part of the debate to-day and yesterday, to the effect that this increase could have been foreseen and ought to have been foreseen. The whole of this Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the increased poundage in the rates. The sum which the Government take is sufficient to pay the rates and the contributions in lieu of rates on all Government property, and it is also sufficient provision for the new Government property which we came into possession of in the course of the year. This provision is wholly and exclusively taken to cover the increased poundage of rates over which we have no control, and which rests entirely with the local authority. I think the lion. Member for Mid Lanark must know that we have no control in that sense over the exact amount of the rates. I think it is now agreed that the valuation of Government property made by the Government valuer has given universal satisfaction. That valuation has been accepted in Scotland and placed on the valuation rolls. They have been accepted equally in Ireland as fair and reasonable, and they have met with the same approval of the local authorities. Once those valuations are fixed we pay-as a contribution the amount which would be levied if the property was not Crown property. The whole of this amount is due to the increase of the poundage of the rates over which the Government have no control, and in order to carry out the bargain made at the request of lion. Members of this House with the local authorities, we are obliged to ask the Committee to make provision for this increased sum. The hon. Member for Mid Lanark inquires why this sum was necessary for England and Ireland and not for Scotland? That must be duo to the fact that the local authorities in Scotland
<col>244</col>
are very reluctant to raise the poundage of the rates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01102"><member>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE</member><membercontribution> said the Secretary to the Treasury was mistaken in saying that they were satisfied with the present valuation of Government property in Ireland, for the general complaint was that it was not valued sufficiently high. He was sorry that, according to the Chairman's ruling, it was not proper for them to discuss the principle on which the assessments of Government properties were made. He thought that on a matter of this great importance they ought to have some representative of the Irish Administration to give them the details of this extra sum of &#x00A3;3,000 which was required from Ireland. They were asked to vote this &#x00A3;3,000 as a Supplementary Estimate in connection with the rating of Government property in Ireland, and no information was given to them as to the way in which this &#x00A3;3,000 was to be expended. Ho presumed that the Secretary to the Treasury was not in a position to give the Committee this information, but he hoped that before this debate came to an end he would be able to give the Committee the details.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01103"><member>*SIR ALBERT ROLLIT</member><membercontribution> said that, in regard to the rates and contributions in lieu of rates in respect of Government property, he wished to say that the Returns he had moved for and obtained wore sent to all the boroughs in England, and he believed in Ireland as well, and no complaint had been made at all in regard to the assessments agreed upon. In his opinion a very great wrong had been redressed by this arrangement, though the principle of the Government being its own valuer was, of course, still open to objection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01104"><member>MR. DALY <memberconstituency>(Monaghan, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the statement of the right lion. Gentleman was very loose in regard to a matter of this kind. He believed, however, the discussion that night would be of very great benefit to the hon. Gentleman, because, although he was new to his office, he must understand, if he wanted to get his Votes through Committee, he must have all the details at his fingers ends. He would feel it his duty
<image src="S4V0090P0I0240"/>
<col>245</col>
to move a reduction of the Vote unless a better explanation was given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01105"><member>MR. CALDWELL</member><membercontribution> thought that the explanation given by the Secretary to the Treasury would not hold water for a moment. Here was an increase of &#x00A3;2,000 in the rates and contributions in lieu of rates for Admiralty property, and of &#x00A3;7,000 for property of the War Department. But look at the enormous buildings of the Government&#x2014;dockyards, post offices, etc.&#x2014;throughout the whole of England and Ireland, and how could it be that this sum of &#x00A3;13,000 was simply owing to increased poundage? It was nothing of the kind. If the hon. Gentleman thought that there was not to be an increased poundage in Scotland he was mistaken. The right hon. Gentleman had said that the Scotch people were satisfied, but he could assure him that the people in that country had been complaining very much. He quite recognised that on a Supplementary Vote they could not go into the principle of a uniform system of contribution; but at the same time he was entitled to call attention to the fact that if Scotland could do without an increased contribution to the rates, so should England.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01106"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said that the hon. Gentleman had declared that they in Ireland were satisfied with the Government contribution to the rates. He was astonished at that in view of what had appeared in the Report of the Royal Commission on Local Taxation which had just been published. In that Report there was a most important memorandum prepared for the Commission by Mr. Charles Dawson, Collector General of Rates in Dublin, who said&#x2014;
<quote>"Government property should be openly valued, and pay rates, not as bounty, but as duty. If it be right, as the giving of a 'bounty' allows, to pay at all, it should be done as a matter of right. The valuation of this kind of property in Dublin is quite inadequate. The Castle of Dublin, with the town palace of the Viceroy, and all its Government offices, residences, private chapels, courtyards and squares, is only valued at &#x00A3;3,550. All the Government buildings in Dublin, including Castle, Law Courts, Custom House, Post Office, Barracks, are only valued at &#x00A3;36,764. In London the Law Courts alone are valued at &#x00A3;56,700."</quote>
Anyone who compared the Castle, Viceroy's palace, barracks, law courts,
<col>246</col>
custom house, post office, and other public buildings in Dublin with those in London would acknowledge that if the same principle of valuation were applied in Dublin as in London, the valuation of the former would be at least &#x00A3;120,000 instead of &#x00A3;36,700. He supposed an opportunity would arise of discussing ere long the Report of the Commission which had been hatching its eggs for the last six or seven years.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01107"><member>*SIR WALTER FOSTER</member><membercontribution> said he quite understood the difficulty of making up the amount of poundage eighteen months beforehand, but he could hardly understand why an additional &#x00A3;10,000 was required for England, and only &#x00A3;3,000 for Ireland, and nothing for Scotland. Some further explanation was surely required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01108"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said that in making the original Estimates for the year allowance was made for any increase in the buildings, for the occupation of additional property, and also for increased valuation that was thought likely to arise on existing property. But a sufficient sum had not been allowed for a rise in the poundage rates, which of course affected the contributions the Government made. Hon Members would see that the increases were not likely to be the same, but would differ with each rating authority. He understood that, on the whole, the valuations had given satisfaction. He believed the Dublin valuation was an old one, but a proposal had been made for a new one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01109"><member>*MR. O'DOHERTY</member><membercontribution> said that the Government property in Ireland, and he took it that it was the same in England, was valued not as the property of private individuals at its net annual value, but at half the net annual rent. They had, in the city of Londonderry, protested against that system over and over again. He wished for some explanation of why the allowance for rates on Government property had been increased in Ireland since local government had been instituted there. Such was not his experience, and he felt that this Vote was a libel upon the County Borough Councils and County Councils in Ireland. Why had this slur been placed on the local bodies in Ireland by the Government?</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0241"/>
<col>247</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01110"><member>MR. TULLY <memberconstituency>(Leitrim, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he wanted some further explanation in regard to the increase of &#x00A3;7,000 as a contribution in lieu of rates on War Department property in England. Then an increase of &#x00A3;3,000 was asked for Ireland; but there had been no general increase of rates in Ireland to justify their asking for such a large sum. On the contrary, since the new rating bodies had been elected by the people there had been all round a reduction of rates, He thought Dublin had been treated in a very unfair manner in regard to the rating of Government buildings. In London a grant of &#x00A3;10,000 was given to the fire brigade in lieu of a contribution to the rates, but no grant was given to the fire brigade in Dublin.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01111"><member>MR. CALDWELL</member><membercontribution> said that the hon. Gentleman had declared that the increase was due to the increase of poundage, but it was obvious that that was not the case, because, had it been due to increase of poundage, it would have applied equally all over the country. It was absurd to come forward in Committee and make a general assertion without giving them any particulars whatsoever.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01112"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution> said he understood the hon. Gentleman to say that the people in Ireland were satisfied with the valuation of the public buildings there. He was not satisfied [laughter]; and all the people he had consulted declared that all the Government buildings in Ireland were entirely underrated. The valuation in England was made by the local authorities, whereas in Ireland it was fixed by Government officials.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01113"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution> said that that was a Question of principle, which did not arise on the Supplementary Estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01114"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution> said that hon. Gentlemen who laughed at a subject like taxation would be a good deal more serious if the money came out of their own pockets. This was a serious matter, and, as a protest against the absence of details in respect, to the amount of the grant allocated to Ireland, he moved the reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;100.</membercontribution></p>

whole of this Vote, as he had professed himself willing to do with the Vote last before the Committee, a very good case might be made out for his so doing. Although it might be perfectly right to bring it in as an ordinary, there was no doubt it was wrong to bring this in as a Supplementary Estimate. It appeared to be an "amount required to meet the additional claims which, in consequence of the earlier discharge under the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, of the local liability to the several railway-companies, will mature in the year." This was a liability which arose under an Act which received the Royal Assent on the 12th of August. 1898. The original Estimates were prepared in November, 1899&#x2014;fifteen months after the Act was passed&#x2014;when every liability which was likely to arise out of the Act was perfectly well forseeable. Why was it not foreseen? How was it that in November, 1899, the Government were unable to foresee a liability which was likely to arise out of an Act passed fifteen months previously? This system of Supplementary Estimates undoubtedly put the finances of the country upon a false basis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01128"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> said it was, of course, foreseen that these sums would have to be paid. They were, as a matter of fact, repayments in respect of a guarantee given by the Government to the Local Government of Ireland. Under the new Local Government Act the county councils of Ireland had accelerated the work, and as soon as the payments had been made and vouched the Government were obliged to repay them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01129"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution> pointed out that his question had not been answered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01130"><member>COLONEL NOLAN <memberconstituency>(Galway, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said, assuming the hon. Member for King's Lynn was right in the opinion he had formed, he did not think his remedy was equally so. If the hon. Gentleman disagreed with the Vote, he should move to reduce the salaries of some of his hon. friends on the Government bench, and not punish the unfortunate people of Ireland by proposing the withdrawal of the Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<col>250</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01131"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution> said he proposed to punish nobody. All he asked was, why was not this expenditure foreseen and provided for in the ordinary Estimates?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01132"><member>COLONEL NOLAN</member><membercontribution> explained that the county councils of Ireland had made these payments, and unless this Vote was agreed to they would be out of pocket &#x00A3;1,500 for three months. It was not a very large sum, and he hoped the hon. Member for King's Lynn would raise no objection.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01133"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution> admitted that the Government expected some acceleration in the matter of these payments, but it could not be provided for until it was known in which cases it was likely to occur payment had not in all cases been accelerated, and it would not be fair to take the whole amount when the whole of the amounts had not become due.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01134"><member>*MR. TULLY</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that some further details ought to be given for the particular sum of &#x00A3;7,000 which was now exercising the attention of the Committee. There was a guarantee given for the railway in Leitrim. He asked how much was included for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01135"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: &#x00A3;1,700 in respect to that guarantee is included in this sum.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01136"><member>*MR. TULLY</member><membercontribution> pointed out that under the Local Government Act, when the light railway rate exceeded sixpence the Government was to pay half, but what happened in Leitrim was that, instead of the ratepayers saving something, they suffered under a heavier tax last year, as this money was not put to the credit of the county in due time. So far as Leitrim was concerned, the Estimate was not justified, because in the first instance they had not received the amount to which they were entitled. He had no faith in the figures of Supplementary Estimates. There was, he thought, always something behind them which would not bear investigation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01137"><member>*SIR JOHN COLOMB <memberconstituency>(Great Yarmouth)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the Vote was to give back from Government what the county councils had already advanced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01139">4. Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;6,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01140"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he should oppose the Vote on the two grounds that the information sent by His Majesty's Minister at Peking as to affairs in China was insufficient and misleading, and always behind date, and that the Estimate was prepared in such a way as was calculated to confuse the hon. Members of the House. He himself was able to show on one occasion that the correspondent of <i>The Times</i> at Peking was a week ahead with information. When His Majesty's Government were questioned as to information that had appeared in <i>The Times,</i> the House was told that they knew nothing about it; and then, perhaps a week afterwards, they were told that the information of the correspondent of <i>The Times</i> was perfectly correct. With regard to the Estimates, could anything be more objectionable than the way in which they were drawn up? This was a Supplementary Estimate of the amount required in the year ending 31st March, 1901, to pay salaries and expenses of the Department of His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and the amount now asked for was for telegrams "consequent on the state of affairs in the Far East." If the Committee turned to page 20, they would find a Supplementary Estimate for the Diplomatic and Consular Services, under which there were these items. "E. Telegrams consequent on the state of affairs in the Far East"; "U. Telegrams consequent on the state of affairs at Lorenzo Marques"; and "E.E. Postage and telegrams consequent on the state of affairs in the Far East." Therefore it would be seen that there were no less than three separate and distinct claims all based upon the state of affairs in the Far East, and all for telegrams in consequence of the state of affairs in the Far East. This he thought was satisfactory. He moved the reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;3,000.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01142"><member>THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (Viscount CRANBORNE, <memberconstituency>Rochester</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said that the Supplementary Estimates were prepared on the same plan as the main Estimates, and that plan was of long standing. He thought that nothing would be more calculated to confuse hon. Members than that Supplementary Estimates should be drawn on a different basis to that on which the main Estimates were drawn. With regard to the other point raised by the hon. Member, he had nothing to say except to express his admiration for the energy and enterprise of <i>The Times.</i> Although, of course, the Government had to be a little more careful, it was always the object of the Secretary of State to lay before the House as much information as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01143"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> thought that the House did not get the full value of the information which came to Ministers. When any specific information was asked for, not only did the Government deny any knowledge, but they did not attempt to telegraph out in order to allay the grave anxiety felt in the country. His reason for objecting to this Vote was in order to make some alteration in the preparation of the Estimates. He was perfectly aware that this amount had only reference to telegrams sent, but everybody did not know that, and anybody outside the Foreign Office reading the Estimate would be under the impression that this was for telegrams sent and received. He therefore supported the reduction.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01144"><member>MR. J. P. FARRELL</member><membercontribution> said the noble Lord's remarks were not an answer to the observations of the hon. Member for East Mayo. The original Estimate for Foreign Office telegrams was&#x00A3;14,000, and they were now asked for an addition of &#x00A3;6,000. If the book-keeping arrangements in connection with these matters were as perfect as they ought to be, it that the original Estimate was not more accurately made out? Complaints had been made in the discus-

<col>253</col>
sion of the other Votes of the high percentage of the increases in the original Estimates shown by the Supplementary Estimates. In this case the increase was over 30 per cent., and no explanation had been vouchsafed of the cause, except what had been stated by the Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He had no knowledge of the causes which led to this telegraphing, or whether it was necessary or not. He would like to hear about the contracts for this telegraphing. He understood that there were two or three lines over which cablegrams could be sent, and it was certainly a question on which they should receive some information. With whom were the contracts entered into, and what was the rate per word? The hon. Member for Northampton had referred to the fact that information had been withheld from the House, although information had been long previously supplied in the public newspapers. It appeared to him singular that any newspaper&#x2014;no matter how great or how large its available</membercontribution></p>

He should say that the Government of the country, which was responsible for the maintenance of the Empire, should be supplied not only with perfectly accurate but absolutely first-hand information. He imagined that the <i>The Times</i> should look to the Government rather than that the Government should look to that newspaper for information. He thought the hon.

The Irish Members had no means of checking before the event any action of the Government in connection with foreign relations, but when the bill came the Irish people were compelled to pay, although a Royal Commission had reported that they were already overtaxed.</p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01150"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said that this Vote, so far as he could make out, was constructed on a different principle from the Foreign Office Vote. He took it that the additional &#x00A3;7,200 was for telegrams sent from and to South Africa and Ashanti. If so, that was a very much better way of keep-

ing the account than in the ease of the previous Vote. He moved the reduction of this Vote as a protest against the character of Sir Alfred Milner's telegrams, which were responsible for a considerable-waste of public money.

Suppose that a Governor telegraphs articles which should not be telegraphed, and a Supplementary Estimate, is presented to us for telegraphing a lot of absurd stuff perfectly unsuitable for telegraphing, surely nothing could be more pertinent than to move the reduction of the Vote, inasmuch as the money has been wasted in telegraphing that which should not have been telegraphed at all.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01157"><member>*THE CHAIEMAN</member><membercontribution>: It is not a new decision that I am stating. It is a very old decision&#x2014;that policy cannot be discussed on a telegram.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01158"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution>: With the deepest respect for your ruling, I do not call it discussing policy to question whether money spent on telegrams has been properly spent. I think that is a matter totally apart from policy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01159"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The substance of the telegrams cannot be discussed on the Vote now before the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01160"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said it was very difficult to understand on what ground they could question this Vote at all. If an Estimate were presented for &#x00A3;60,000 or for &#x00A3;100,000, was the House compelled to vote for it blindly and without any
<col>258</col>
reference to the discretion exercised in the spending of the money? Were they to be debarred altogether from discussing this matter? If they could not question the expenditure for these telegrams on the ground of their length or number, on what grounds wore they to question them at all? In using the wires from South Africa Sir A. Milner appeared to have no regard either for the public interest or for the urgency or necessity of the matter which he telegraphed. As a protest, he moved that the Vote be reduced by &#x00A3;3,000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01161">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;4,200, be granted for the said Service."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Dillon.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01162"><member>MR. LABOUCHERE</member><membercontribution> asked whether the Secretary for the Colonies would be good enough to tell them how much of this expenditure applied to Ashanti and how much to South Africa. The Vote put the two things together. He also asked what was the price per word of telegrams from Ashanti and South Africa to England, and whether the Government received any rebate from the telegraph companies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01163"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON</member><membercontribution> said he recognised that they could not discuss the general policy of the Government in South Africa on this Vote, but were they not entitled to ask with reference to a particular telegram from a Colonial Governor, or sent by the Colonial Office, whether it was worth the money spent upon it? They had had other Votes in which furniture was included, and they had discussed the question whether the furniture was worth the money paid for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01164"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution> said that involved a question of policy, and must be discussed on the original Estimate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01165"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he had never discussed the policy of the question, but simply whether a particular communication was of sufficient importance to warrant its being sent by telegraph.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01166"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution> said that that question could not be discussed without considering the action of the individual

sending the telegram, and that must come on the general Vote for the office of the one responsible for the action.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01167"><member>THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES (Mr. J. CHAMBERLAIN, <memberconstituency>Birmingham, W.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: I do not propose to continue the discussion with the Chair. I will only say on the subject that I take full responsibility for all telegrams that have been sent, not only to, but from South Africa. If, therefore, any exception is taken to any particular telegram being sent, I shall be perfectly prepared to discuss that telegram on the proper occasion, and to go into the whole of the details, which will, of course, be on the Vote for my own salary. As regards the question asked me by the hon. Member for Northampton, that is a question which really does not concern the Colonial Office. The hon. Member knows perfectly well that the Colonial Office does not make a separate telegraph contract. This is generally an arrangement which is made for all offices by the Post Office. But it is the fact that the cable companies give a very large reduction to the Government. I cannot myself say what the reduction is, but I think the cost per word is little more than half the charge to the general public. As regards the question of the amount respectively for the telegrams sent to South Africa and Ashanti it is quite impossible to go into detail, nor does the present Vote, which is a purely Supplementary Vote, show what is the total amount of the telegrams sent to both places. Of course, the Vote was taken originally for the whole telegraphic service of the Colonial Office. In consequence of the state of things caused by the South African War and by the Ashanti War, the number of telegrams estimated to be sent has been very largely exceeded, and I would point out to the hon. Member that it does not mean necessarily that these telegrams were sent either to South Africa or to Ashanti. For instance, there has been an immense amount of telegraphy owing to the action of the colonies in furnishing troops for the South African War. Communications have had to go between Australia and this country, between New Zealand and this country, and between Canada and this country; and owing to
<col>260</col>
that the number of telegrams has been largely increased. The word "mainly" refers to the South African War, and it is in consequence of the South African War that we have had to send these telegrams to other colonies like Australia and Canada.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01168"><member>MR. FLYNN <memberconstituency>(Cork, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> complained that the Colonial Secretary had not given the slightest idea as to the relative proportions of the cost for Ashanti and South Africa respectively. The Committee were practically asked by the Government to vote these sums blindfold. The original Estimate had been increased by 75 per cent. Were the Committee to understand that the Colonial Office were not able to calculate the probable amount of telegraphing they would have to do in connection with affairs in South Africa and West Africa more accurately than that? In this Estimate, as in all others, there was the same feature of extraordinary and excessive expenditure, causing large discrepancies, which ought to have been avoided. It was not unreasonable to ask for the rate per telegram charged by the cable companies to the Government as distinguished from the general public, or how many hundreds of telegrams it would take to account for this sum of &#x00A3;7,200. He hoped the examination of the Vote would be persisted in until a reasonable amount of information was forthcoming.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01169"><member>MR. CREAN <memberconstituency>(Cork, S.E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> protested against the form in which the Estimate was presented to the Committee. An excess of &#x00A3;7,000 over the original Estimate was simply inexplicable without any details being given as to how, exactly, the money had been spent. The House of Commons was treated with contempt, and it would be far more decent for the Government to say, "We want this money, you will have to give it, and we will give no information whatever." It was nothing but a policy of extravagance, and information was required in order that the fault might be traced to the persons responsible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01170"><member>MR. PATRICK O'BRIEN <memberconstituency>(Kilkenny)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that although there were many Irish Members who wished to discuss
<image src="S4V0090P0I0248"/>
<col>261</col>
this subject upon the lines which had been ruled out of order, they would gladly bow to the Chairman's ruling. If there was one thing which they had a right to do, he thought it was to discuss any Estimates which were placed before them for special purposes; and although they knew that, however long these discussions might be, they would never succeed in reducing any particular Estimate at the time, they hoped and believed that healthy criticism would do something to remind Ministers that they would have to be more careful as to how they placed such matters before the Committee. He could not understand how this Estimate came to be put on the Paper at all in its present form. Why was it not put in such a way as would enable the House of Commons to exercise its right to discuss it? It was an extraordinary fact that although the original amount was &#x00A3;10,000, that amount had been exceeded by &#x00A3;7,200. That was a remarkable piece of extravagance. By the Chairman's ruling they could not touch upon Sir Alfred Milner, and they could not get at the Minister who was responsible for his appointment, for those were some of the particular items which the Committee would not be allowed to discuss. He wished to ask the Chairman in what way they could discuss this matter? This particular item seemed to be nobody's child, and yet it had to be paid for at a very extravagant price. They were told that they could not question the money which had been spent by Sir Alfred Milner, and that meant that he could spend what he liked and nobody here could question it. They desired to be orderly, and he wished to ask the Chairman if he could suggest any way in conformity with the ruling which he had given in which they could discuss this remarkable extravagance on the part of Sir Alfred Milner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01171"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The answer is a very simple one. Among the Estimates which will be laid upon the Table presently will be one under Class 3, Vote 6, Colonial Office Vote, and one of the items will be "telegrams." When the Vote comes before the Committee the whole question can be raised.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01172"><member>MR. PATRICK O'BRIEN</member><membercontribution> asked, upon a point of order, if it was right for an
<col>262</col>
Estimate to be placed on the Paper in such a way that it could not be discussed, and was there any other heading under which this item should have been placed?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01173"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: It is not correct to say that it cannot be discussed. The Vote has now been discussed for over an hour. In what I have laid down I have only followed the ruling of my predecessors that, on a Supplementary Vote for telegrams, it is impossible to discuss the policy embodied in those telegrams. The substance of telegrams is not open for discussion upon an item which relates only to their cost.<lb/>
Attention called to the fact that forty Members were not present. House counted, and forty Members being found present&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01174"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution> thought the explanation which had been given was altogether unsatisfactory. It was most extraordinary that the right hon. Gentleman could not come nearer the mark in his original Estimate without having to come to the House for an additional &#x00A3;7,200. The Chairman had ruled that they could not discuss the words contained in the telegrams, and they had to be satisfied with the word of the right hon. Gentleman and those acting under him as to whether those telegrams were necessary or not, and also as to whether the words transmitted in them were correct or not. It was a most unfortunate thing that this Vote had been put down in such a way that it was very difficult to discuss it. The charge for telegrams was very heavy, and hon. Members around him were very anxious that full details should be given, and it would be very satisfactory if the right hon. Gentleman could see his way to tell them what number of words were placed in those telegrams, and at what rate they were charged for. Ireland had to contribute a large sum towards this extra &#x00A3;7,200. He hoped his hon. friends would press this matter to a division, and any support he could give them would be gladly given. He could assure the right hon. Gentleman and every member of the Government that in future they would find that every item which they brought forward in the House would be scanned and criticised
<image src="S4V0090P0I0249"/>
<col>263</col>
closely by hon. Members from Ireland. He hoped the right hon. Gentleman and those acting with him would conceive it to be their duty in the future to place such Votes as this in such a position that hon. Members of the House would be able to discuss them as fully as they deserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01175"><member>MR. O'MARA <memberconstituency>(Kilkenny, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it had been stated in the course of the debate that this item was 75 per cent, higher than the original Estimate. They would find, if they took the trouble to look it up, that this Supplementary Estimate was 300 per cent, larger than last year's Estimate, and he wished to bring to the notice of the Committee the fact that last year's Estimate covered six months of the war in South Africa, including those long telegraphic communications relating to the Bloemfontein Conference and the negotiations which preceded it. No details had been placed before the House to show that the number of telegrams sent in the period for which this extra sum was asked was larger than during the period he had just alluded to, and he could not under-</membercontribution></p>

He wished to join in the protest which had been made from the Irish benches against being asked to vote such large sums of money without having sufficient details. Ireland would be called upon to pay its quota to this expenditure, and therefore they bad a right to examine closely every item of expenditure which was placed before the House. Supplementary Estimates required a greater amount of consideration than the ordinary Estimates, because it was money required in excess of the ordinary requirements, and for that very reason they required to be more carefully examined. He would not go into the question of the contents of those telegrams, but be would like the Colonial Secretary to tell them how it was that three times as much money had been spent this year as was spent in the previous year.</p>

Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;1,015, be granted to His Majesty to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Lord Privy Seal."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01181"><member>MR. DALZIEL <memberconstituency>(Kirkcaldy Burghs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said it was a matter of some surprise that a proper representative of the Government had not on this motion thought it is duty to make some expla-

nation of the Vote. It differed from other Votes which the Committee had been discussing, inasmuch as it was not a Supplementary Estimate, but practically a new Vote. Pie protested in the most emphatic fashion against a new Vote, embodying a new principle, and practically creating a new office, being smuggled through in the shape of a Supplementary Estimate. He objected to the manner in which the Vote had been brought forward, and maintained that before the country was pledged to an expenditure on this new head, the permission of the House of Commons ought to have been obtained. As the result of an
<image src="S4V0090P0I0251"/>
<col>267</col>
understanding which had been come to with the House of Commons, the Great Seal Act of 1884 was passed, and the duties in connection with the office of Lord Privy Seal were abolished. Since that time many distinguished men had filled the office of Lord Privy Seal in an honorary capacity; at any rate, they did not receive any remuneration for any services which it was imaginable they discharged. These included Lord Rosebery, Lord Cross, Mr. Gladstone, Lord Cadogan, Lord Tweedmouth, and Lord Salisbury himself. His objection to this Vote was not of a personal character in regard to the present distinguished occupant of the post. No member of the Cabinet was held in higher respect by his political opponents than the Prime Minister; and some of them were, in these later days, only beginning to realise the great debt of gratitude which they owed to the Prime Minister for carrying the country through troublous times in a peaceful and diplomatic fashion. It was in no personal sense, then, that he objected to this Vote; but he thought the Committee was entitled to some explanation. What could that explanation be? There was plenty of money in the Treasury chest, and there was no reason to reestablish this office except that explained in a letter which the Prime Minister wrote to a late distinguished colleague of his, the former President of the Local Government Board, the Member for Sleaford, in which the Prime Minister said that there were so many people to make room for that the right hon. Gentleman had to give up his post. That was the reason why they were asked to go back on a decision the House of Commons arrived at many years ago, and to re-establish an office which was purely ornamental and a sinecure. He could imagine the Prime Minister, after having listened to every claim made upon him, and having surrendered to it, sitting down in Hatfield and acknowledging to himself that he had given so much away that he had nothing left for himself. For what was his position? He was no longer Foreign Secretary&#x2014;he had given that post away. He had no salary; not even an office to which his letters could be addressed. And therefore he had to make up his mind to confer upon himself some post; and so
<col>268</col>
hit upon that of the Lord Privy Seal. He (the hon. Member) objected to a salary being attached to this post. It seemed to him that if the Prime Minister was to be paid&#x2014;and ho thought he ought to lie paid, and well paid&#x2014;then the salary ought to be asked for on the footing of Premiership, and that it ought not to be brought forward on a Vote of this kind for an office which had no duties attached to it. If the Prime Minister was to have a salary, then it ought to be a respectable salary. He could not understand how the noble Lord arrived at the conclusion that &#x00A3;2,000 a year was what he was worth. He might have sent for Whitaker s Almanack, and gone down the list of Ministers, and when he came to the Colonial Secretary ho might have said, "What does that great man get for his transcendent services to the country? &#x00A3;5,000&#x0021; And he might have said to himself, "If the Colonial Secretary receives &#x00A3;5,000 a year, I ought to write myself down at half that sum." He (the hon. Member) objected to the fact that the Prime Minister received only &#x00A3;2,000 per year when his subordinates&#x2014; for, after all, they were his subordinates &#x2014;received more than double that sum. Why, the salary of the Clerk of the House of Lords was more, and a town council engineer received more. He protested in the interest of the Prime Minister, who, it seemed to him, had been very badly treated. Lord Salisbury had been placed in a situation which appealed to the generous instincts of our nature, and if none of his friends stood up for him it was necessary for some hon. Members on that side of the House to do so. He objected also that the, Prime Minister should so undervalue himself. He did not think that he ought to be allowed to become a kind of Parliamentary blackleg. He ought to belong to the Parliamentary trade union, and should not take less than trade union wages, or less than an Under Secretary who read out answers to questions in the House of Commons and was not capable of explaining them. Therefore he thought the noble Lord was entitled to their sympathy. He did not go so far as to say that the same course should be pursued here as had been taken in some other countries. He believed that from the time the war broke out between Spain
<image src="S4V0090P0I0252"/>
<col>269</col>
and America the Spanish Ministers went on half rations. He did not suggest that Ministers here should go on half rations, or that they should make a subscription on behalf of the Prime Minister. But some more satisfactory way should be taken of dealing with the Prime Minister. Further, a most extraordinary departure from constitutional rule had been made in the preparation of this Estimate. They were asked to vote a sum at the rate of &#x00A3;400 a year for the private secretary to the Prime Minister. That was an innovation. The Constitution knew nothing of the Prime Minister; and he doubted whether there was any record of the House which spoke of the private secretary of the Prime Minister. They might just as well put down a sum for the private secretary of the parish minister. It might have been put down as salary of the private secretary to the Lord Privy Seal, but not as secretary to the Prime Minister; and some explanation was required why this item had been prepared in that particular way. The right hon. Gentleman in charge of the Vote might say, "It is all very well, but what could the Prime Minister have done? He must have some claim on the country; he must have some salary." It was very difficult to answer these questions; but he might have left some of his friends out of the Cabinet, or, at all events, he might have induced some of his present colleagues to give up their posts&#x2014;the Colonial Secretary, for instance, who has had a very busy time of it for the last few years. He might have offered to take the duties of that arduous Department, and induced the right hon. the Colonial Secretary to go to another place with some seductive title. It was disgraceful that the Prime Minister should have no official office, although the Foreign Secretary had shown so much sympathy with him as to offer him a room in the Foreign Office. But that was not the way to treat the Prime Minister, who might have got a seat in
<col>270</col>
the Colonial Secretary's office with a big seal stamp handy on his desk. The Committee was entitled to some explanation for this departure from a bargain solemnly passed by the House of Commons taking away all the duties and the salary of the Lord Privy Seal; and he hoped that the right hon. Gentleman would be able to tell the Committee that he would either withdraw the Tote or bring forward a handsome sum, worthy of the great services of the Prime Minister of the country.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman's speech which was really not meant to argue for an increase of the Prime Minister's salary, but was intended for the indulgence of some ingenious sarcasm at the expense of some of the Prime Minister's colleagues. As regards his comments as to the actual course pursued, it is perfectly true that there were certain incongruities and inconsistencies in the course taken, and why was it? Because, as everybody knows, the Prime Minister is not formally recognised in the Constitution, although he is the most important person in the Ministry. That is one of the curious results of our Constitution which has slowly grown up in the course of centuries. There are these apparent inconsistencies in the Constitution, and we should be slow to interfere with them, for they do no harm to the growth of our institutions. We all know that there is a Prime Minister; we all know that he does not appeal among the officers of the State as such. Sometimes he is called the First Lord of the Treasury, sometimes he is called Foreign Secretary or Chancellor of the Exchequer, and sometimes Lord Privy Seal, but never has he been called Prime Minister in the formal proceedings of the House. That being so, we have to fit our arrangements into this somewhat anomalous state of things. I think the plan we have adopted is not a bad one. The office of Privy Seal was vacant, and it is one to which the duties of the Prime Minister may be attached as well as to the office of First Lord of the Treasury or Foreign Secretary; and the hon. Gentleman himself is first to acknowledge that he should not be an unpaid Member of the Government and that we must attach a salary to the office. Of course, should the present holder of the office of Privy Seal cease to be Prime Minister, his salary would cease at the same time, and should he resign the office of Privy Seed and another gentleman
<col>272</col>
be appointed to the office who was not Prime Minister, he would not receive the salary. So long as the duties are associated with the Prime Minister it is quite clear that you ought to make the office a paid office. The hon. Gentleman tells us that the salary of &#x00A3;2,000 a year is insufficient. I am quite willing, to agree with him that that salary is no measure, absolutely or relatively, of the services of the Prime Minister to the State; but &#x00A3;2,000 a year is the old salary attaching to this office of Privy Seal; it is the salary which the Prime Minister himself suggested; and, though agree that on any scale of merit it is inadequate, if the Prime Minister himself is contented I do not know that either my colleagues or the House of Commons need interfere in the matter. That is the broad explanation of the policy that has been pursued, and I feel sure it will commend itself to the House at large; and I hope the hon. Gentleman will feel that I have justified the course which the Government have taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01185"><member>SIR H. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN <memberconstituency>(Stirling Burghs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The right hon. Gentleman has dealt ingeniously with the question raised by my hon. friend; but he passed over the <i>fons et origo</i> of the difficulty, which was the great mistake that he has committed in recent years of divorcing the position of the head of the Ministry from the occupant of the office of First Lord of the Treasury. That office is the natural and proper one to be held by the Prime Minister; and it is peculiar that, though, as the right hon. Gentleman says, the Premiership has sometimes been associated with the Foreign Secretaryship and sometimes with the office of First Lord of the Treasury, it has only been associated with the Foreign Secretaryship in the case of Lord Salisbury himself; and nothing but evil came to the country from the combination of these two
<image src="S4V0090P0I0254"/>
<col>273</col>
offices. I have not a word to say in depreciation of Lord Salisbury, either as Foreign Secretary or as Prime Minister; but I say it is perfectly impossible that any man can properly fulfil the functions of both offices. I will take the case of the Foreign Office. Undoubtedly Lord Salisbury devoted an enormous amount of time &#x2014;and probably prejudiced his health by his devotion&#x2014;to the duties of the Foreign Minister. He has filled that great position with great success and to the great advantage of the nation, but during all that time every one can see that the proper business of the Prime Minister, which is to keep in proper coordination his own colleagues and to keep a master-eye on all their proceedings &#x2014;anyone can see that that was neglected. Taking the work of the Foreign Office alone, we lose the advantage of a second head assisting the man nominally at the head of the office. When there is a Prime Minister as well as a Foreign Secretary all the Foreign Office work, all telegrams, despatches, and so forth are submitted to the judgment of the Prime Minister; and thus there is an additional guarantee that the affairs of the country are being wisely and deliberately administered. It has often surprised me that the country and the House of Commons bore so patiently a state of things so obviously prejudicial to the public interest. At last Lord Salisbury, partly owing to his health being overtaxed, determined to give up one of these offices, lie retained the Premiership. The proper course would have been for him to take the position of First Lord of the Treasury. As we all know, the emoluments of public functionaries vary considerably, and I am not at all sure that that variance is altogether in the public interest. I think there is a great deal to be said for a rearrangement in such a way as to bring about greater equality; but that is not before us now. We have only to do with this particular arrangement,
<col>274</col>
made to meet an emergency. I confess that to my mind there was a way of meeting it which would not have involved the recreation of a sinecure office, and that was to have made the Prime Minister First Lord of the Treasury, and to have made some other arrangement of the other offices among the distinguished Gentlemen on the bench opposite. The office of First Lord of the Treasury&#x2014; and I speak in the presence of one who knows it well&#x2014;has this advantage, that it has little or no departmental work attaching to it. It has a certain amount of agreeable duty in the way of the bestowal of patronage and in the selection of the recipients of good things, which is always an easy, a charming, and a delightful duty. But, except for that, I do not think the First Lord of the Treasury is overworked. Therefore it is an office particularly suitable to the man who has to exercise a general supervising power over the Proceedings of the Departments of State. That is the proper arrangement, and I regret that the Government have found themselves forced to revive the salary for an office which is almost the last surviving sinecure in the public service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01186"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution> said the matter was undoubtedly one of great public importance.

<p id="S4V0090P0-01188"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution> said the office of Prime Minister was unknown to the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0255"/>
<col>275</col>
Constitution, and the introduction of the title in the Estimates was another example of the slipshod English in which they were framed. But, although the title was unknown, the office was not, and it had been amply provided for ever since the time of Sir Robert Walpole, when the Treasury was put into commission in such a way, and the position of the First Lord so provided for, that although he had an office of dignity and proper emoluments, he was freed from Parliamentary duties in order that he might be able to oversee his colleagues and supporters. The proper function of the Prime Minister was to oversee his colleagues in the Government; and he was bound to say that, since the recent changes in the Government had been effected, the Government had received a great accession of strength from the circumstance that Lord Salisbury, as Prime Minister, had been restored to a position which enabled him to superintend the work of his colleagues. During the time that Lord Salisbury was both Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary each department was allowed to do what seemed best in its own eyes, and the result of this absence of control had been that mistakes of the gravest character were committed. The Duke of Wellington had said that it was impossible for anyone to exercise the office of Prime Minister unless he was also First Lord of the Treasury, because it was essential that he should have that control of the purse-strings which the latter office gave him. Why, recently Lord Salisbury in the House of Lords made a strong and determined attack on the Treasury for the manner in which it met the demands upon it for the public service. If Lord Salisbury were First Lord of the Treasury, which he ought to be as Prime Minister, that state of things could not have occurred. The Government had; been reconstituted and strengthened&#x2014; (Opposition laughter) &#x2014; well, reconstituted&#x2014;and there should have been no difficulty whatever in finding for the right lion. Gentleman the Leader of the House another post, so that the office of First Lord of the Treasury might revert to the Prime Minister. He hoped the Leader of the House would not be offended when he said that the right hon. Gentleman en-
<col>276</col>
joyed the emoluments and dignities of the office without discharging any of its duties. But if the Government had had the courage of their convictions, what they should have done was to boldly propose to create the office of Prime Minister and endow it with a salary of &#x00A3;5,000 a year. He submitted, that it was not a proper thing to come down and ask this House to endow the Prime Minister with an insufficient salary in the name of an office which was so discredited that it had been, abolished by Act of Parliament years ago.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01189"><member>MR. T. P. O'CONNOR <memberconstituency>(Liverpool, Scotland)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the Committee were discussing a very important question. He believed there was one point on which all sections of the Committee were agreed: &#x2014;namely, that the change which bad been made was one in many respects for the better. No one had the least objection to the Prime Minister bung relieved from the terrible burden of the Foreign Secretaryship; the point on which the First Lord of the Treasury and the Committee were at variance was the method by which the Prime Minister had been relieved from the duties of the Foreign Office. By the Act of 1884&#x2014;"to simplify the passing of instruments under the Great Seal of the United Kingdom"&#x2014;it was enacted that it "shall not be necessary that any instrument shall, after the passing of this Act, be passed under the Privy Seal," or, in other words, the functions of the Privy Seal were practically abolished by that statute. Yet here, by a Supplementary Estimate, they were practically repealing the principal effect of that Act. The Committee would remember some time ago, when Colonel King-Harman was a Member of this House, the then Chief Secretary for Ireland attempted to establish in the Estimates a position for an Under Secretaryship for Ireland. That was opposed, and, after considerable discussion, the Chief Secretary had to withdraw his proposals, as it was found to be impossible to carry them through without
<image src="S4V0090P0I0256"/>
<col>277</col>
a special Act of Parliament.&#x2020; Yet the Committee, now, were asked to re-establish, by a Supplementary Estimate, an office which had long been abolished, when it was found impossible to establish a paltry Under Secretaryship without an Act of Parliament. He quite agreed as to the wisdom of Lord Salisbury being relieved from the duties of the Foreign Office, and he was strongly of opinion that had Lord Salisbury, being Prime Minister, coupled that duty with a less onerous office in the past, the history of the last year and a half would have been less sanguinary. The action of the Government in reviving the office of the Lord Privy Seal was simply a palinode. The First Lord of the Treasury, which was the proper office for the Prime Minister to hold, had a general control over the expenditure of the country, and was thus able to control the different heads of the Departments of the Government; but the Lord Privy Seal had no such control, and it was never intended he should. Now the Government proposed to re-establish an abolished office, and to recreate a salary which was never intended to be recreated. His hon. friend had been more than justified in the position he had taken up in this matter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01190"><member>*SIR J. FERGUSSON <memberconstituency>(Manchester, N.

It was as small as the question of the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. The hon. Member for King's Lynn suggested that it would be better for the First Lord of the Treasury to resign his office so that the Prime Minister should assume it, and that he, in turn, should be Lord Privy Seal. That was a suggestion which, if acted upon, would open the door for the strongest opposition from the other side. The office of Lord Privy Seal had not been abolished, and it was not so many years ago that a Prime Minister in the House of Commons assumed it in addition to his other. He remembered

that Lord Malmesbury, when he held the office, was extremely useful in the House of Lords, calling himself the odd man. It was an office of great dignity, ranking very high in the order of precedence, and was therefore suitable as an appanage of the Prime Minister, who had resigned the onerous office of Foreign Secretary. The unrivalled power of work Lord Salisbury had enabled him, until recently, to carry on the duties of Foreign Secretary in addition to those of the head of the Government, but it was not surprising that, with advancing age, he should wish to be relieved of the direct duties of Secretary of State. No doubt, as Prime Minister, he would exercise supervision over the foreign policy of the country, and it was appropriate that the office of Lord Privy Seal should be held by him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01191"><member>MR. EDMUND ROBERTSON <memberconstituency>(Dundee)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he did not at all agree with the right hon.

Without knowing it themselves, and without, he was sure, any intention on the part of the Government, they had been plunged deep into the mysteries of the British Constitution. He did not object to the specific arrangement proposed that day that this salary should be attached to this particular office so long as it was held by the Prime Minister, but questions had been raised as to the character of the office itself, and as to the existence of any duties attached to the office. He thought the time had come when, before proceeding to vote a salary for an office to which they were told no duties were attached, they should have legal advice. He asked the Attorney General to tell them what was the legal status of this officer. He had before him the Act of Parliament of 1884, to which the hon. Member for King's Lynn had referred. The Act declared that no legal instrument need, after that date, be passed under the Privy Seal. He wished to know whether that phrase included all the duties attached to the office of Lord Privy Seal?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01194"><member>THE ATTORNEY GENERAL (Sir ROBERT FINLAY, <memberconstituency>Inverness Burghs</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution> said that the Committee should consider the matter in the light of common sense. Could it be supposed that before the passing of the Act of 1884 much time was actually spent by the Lord Privy Seal in passing legal instruments? The Lord Privy Seal would not personally look after matters of that kind. The office had existed for a very long time. In other days there were duties attached to the office which had now become obsolete; but the office bad been retained, and it had proved extremely useful. It had generally been a Cabinet office, and he thought it was a very happy phrase which was used by the right hon. Baronet the Member for North-East Manchester, that the holder of the office had on one occasion been a sort of "odd man" in the Cabinet, ready, to do any duty. The right hon. and learned Gentleman did not pretend that the duties were onerous, but the Act of 1884 did not abolish the office altogether. The truth was that the office existed, it had been held for a long time past by a Cabinet Minister, and he ventured to think that an office of this kind, with no departmental duties attached to it, might be extremely useful.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01195"><member>MR. SYDNEY BUXTON</member><membercontribution> said this question had been raised without any personal reference at all to Lord Salisbury. It was purely as a matter of expediency affecting the public service that his hon. friend had raised it. What they objected to on that side of the House was that they were asked to vote for the re-establishment of an office which was neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring&#x2014;an office to which no duties
<col>280</col>
were attached. They were asked practically&#x2014;and this was the complaint&#x2014;to vote a salary, not for an office, but for a particular individual. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House had said that if Lord Salisbury resigned the office of Lord Privy Seal the salary would cease with his leaving the office. It seemed to him an unconstitutional proposal that they should vote a salary, not for an office, but for a person. What they desired was to have a Prime Minister with a proper salary. He certainly thought, so far as the debate had gone, that the general feeling was that the Prime Minister ought not to receive a salary from the country of lesser amount than that of any of his colleagues. He was merely looking at this question from the point of view of the public service, and he was bound to say that he agreed with the hon. Member for King's Lynn that they might to have created at tin-present moment an office for the Prime Minister in the House of Lords. He hoped the Government would take that into consideration. He knew they could not do it off-hand, but be thought that a great many Members felt very strongly that a suitable office ought to be created for the Prime Minister, as well as a suitable office for the Leader of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01196"><member>MR. MALCOLM <memberconstituency>(Suffolk, Stowmarket)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the Prime Minister was regarded with great respect on both sides of the House. They were lucky in having got the Prime Minister so cheap. The hon. Member for King's Lynn had put forward a most unconstitutional doctrine. He actually said that the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House of Commons should exchange their respective official positions. The hon. Member for King's Lynn brought in the Duke of Wellington as a great constitutional authority. He never thought the hon. Member would subscribe to the opinion that the First Lord of the Treasury in the House of Commons should give up control of the purse, or that he would go further and; say that Lord Salisbury should be First Lord of the Treasury in the other House. They had always understood it to be the privilege of the House of Commons to have control of the purse. The doc-

<p id="S4V0090P0-01197"><member>*MR. HEMPHILL <memberconstituency>(Tyrone, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> regretted that the Attorney General had not indicated to the Committee the duties now attached to the office of Lord Privy Seal. The Act of Parliament expressly said that no instrument need be passed under the Privy Seal; the office of Lord Privy Seal had ceased to have any utility. True in old times Privy Seal was an important office, and through the holder of it the sanction of the Sovereign was expressed in relation to many matters; but that importance no longer existed. He thought the First Lord of the Treasury should be a Member of the House of Commons, but that did not solve the question. They had now a 20-horse power Cabinet. There was no precedent in history for a Cabinet of twenty learned and unlearned Lords, and surely out of the score one might be First Lord of the Treasury and sit in the Commons. How right hon. Gentlemen and noble Lords should shift and settle their offices he would not presume to suggest, but certainly he desired the presence of the present First Lord of the Treasury so long as they were afflicted with the present Administration. In these parlous times they had no right to saddle the country with a salary of &#x00A3;2,000 a year for an office which had not existed since 1884. They were not in such affluent circumstances, in such golden times, in such rosy seasons that, with an income tax of probably 1s. 6d. in the &#x00A3;1, and an addition to the National Debt of &#x00A3;100,000,000, the interest for which the taxpayers must provide, they could throw away &#x00A3;2,000 a year. With Irish unselfishness he would not grudge the Prime Minister &#x00A3;2,000 if he thought he needed it, but that was out of the question, and he doubted if constitutionally the House would be justified in voting the money; but in any case, there was no reason for doing so. If the Prime Minister chose to give up the seals of the Foreign Office for the purpose of getting rid of some of the Cabinet, and replacing them by other followers, he ought to do it at his own expense.</membercontribution></p>
<col>282</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01198"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: I should have rather thought that the speech we have just heard might have been considered a worthy termination of a debate which has not been very serious or addressed to any very serious constitutional problem. So far as I can discover, three main objects have been had in view by hon. Members in the criticisms they have offered. In the first place they have repeated that rather time-worn attack upon the association of the office of Prime Minister with the post of Foreign Secretary. The Leader of the Opposition dwelt at length on that subject, and the hon. Member for Scotland Division followed his example. We do not agree with the view expressed. We think that the period Lord Salisbury was able to devote to the offices of Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary combined was marked by great benefit to the country, and if that combination has ceased it is not because in Lord Salisbury's opinion, and certainly not in that of his colleagues, it was otherwise than beneficial, but because, unfortunately, the strength of the Prime Minister is not equal to supporting the weight of two such onerous offices at the same time. A less amiable object hon. Members have had in view is an attack on the Colonial Secretary. ["No."] Certainly three or four speakers explained at length that, had not the Prime Minister been also Foreign Secretary a year and a half ago there would not have been war in South Africa. I am surprised at the extraordinarily minute knowledge displayed of what goes on in the Cabinet by gentlemen who are not there. They speak with absolute assurance of the relations of one Minister to another, and of matters upon which they can have no knowledge, all founded on conjecture springing from party zeal and a fervid imagination. The third object of the debate appears to me to be to turn the Prime Minister into the First Lord of the Treasury, and the First Lord of the Treasury into the Lord Privy Seal. That was the amiable suggestion of my hon. friend the Member for King's Lynn. Ho said, as others have said, that commonly, though very far from universally, the office of Prime Minister has been associated with the office of First Lord of the Treasury;
<image src="S4V0090P0I0259"/>
<col>283</col>
and that was justified by the right hon. Gentleman opposite on the ground that the First Lord of the Treasury had little or no administrative work to perform. Well, that is true even in a greater degree in regard to the Lord Privy Seal, and if the fact that the First Lord of the Treasury has not any Department is a good reason for very frequently associating with that office the Prime Minister ship, it appears ample justification for the course the Government has actually taken, which is that of choosing an office which has never been abolished, which is legally constituted, and has been continuously filled by some member of the Government up to the present moment, on the very ground that it has not got duties associated with it, and that therefore the holder of the office has ample leisure for carrying out the great duties of Prime Minister. Then my hon. friend the Member for King's Lynn thinks that as the Leader of the House has nothing to do, as he leads a leisured life, a life of ease and luxury, the office is not worthy of its emolument. Well, Sir. I wish my hon. friend would for a week fill the office which he is so eminently qualified to adorn; his well-known appetite for work, I think, would find ample satisfaction. Whether or not his particular style of Parliamentary oratory would be suited to the special functions of the Leader of the House, at all events I am certain he would not find it a sinecure office. But my hon. friend fell into one mistake. He said, truly enough, that the position of Prime Minister should be a position of dignity, but added that therefore he should be First Lord of the Treasury instead of being Lord Privy Seal. As a matter of fact, the First Lord of the Treasury has no technical dignity or rank, he ranks behind every Secretary of State in point of dignity, and the Lord Privy Seal ranks before every Secretary of State in point of dignity. The Lord Privy Seal is next, I think, to the Lord President of the Council and the Lord Chancellor.</membercontribution></p>

<col>284</col>
therefore very suitable for the Prime Minister; and I can see no objection whatever to the course which the Government have pursued, except the singular objection which has been urged with kind persistency by hon. Gentlemen opposite, that the salary of &#x00A3;2,000 a year is not adequate for the Prime Minister of this country. I do not deny that, but this is all that has been suggested by the Prime Minister himself. If, however, I understand that, <i>nemine contradicente,</i> a larger amount would be unanimously voted, if I could receive some assurance that that would pass without debate, discussion, or the expenditure of time, it might be worth considering whether the Vote might not be withdrawn and a higher salary proposed. But, on the whole, I am inclined to think that, however generous hon. Gentlemen may be in these suggestions of increased pay when these suggestions have not the immediate effect of expediting public business, their and our would notably cool if the proposal were made; and I am convinced that we should find a remarkable and unexpected number of persons who, when it came to the point, would say that, after all, if the Prime Minister was content with &#x00A3;2,000 it would be perfectly monstrous in these hard times to extract from the hard-wrung British taxpayer an additional &#x00A3;3,000. In these circumstances I venture to suggest to the House that our policy is in accordance with constitutional usage, that it gives to the Prime Minister an office of great dignity which, outside his duties as Prime Minister, inflicts on him no extra labour and involves no expenditure of time, and that it is an arrangement which is economical to the, taxpayer. I do not think any other arrangement which could be suggested could combine all those advantages, or even a majority of them. I venture to suggest, therefore, that the House might now consent to accept the arrangement, which, as far as I can judge, meets all the necessities of the case.</membercontribution></p>

most fitted to sit on that bench, and I am also prepared to admit that every gentleman on that Bench is best fitted to occupy the particular office he holds; but notwithstanding the great wisdom of these gentlemen they are in my opinion now doing a thing in a very stupid manner. Their object is perfectly legitimate&#x2014; namely, to give a salary to the Prime Minister. Why do they not propose a salary for the Prime Minister, instead of giving him a salary by a bye-wind and reviving the dormant office of Lord Privy Seal? No one would deny that the Prime Minister should have private secretaries, and that they should be paid. No one would wish to vote against that part of the Vote, but the reason why I intend to vote against the salary of the Lord Privy Seal is that I consider it more consistent with the dignity of this House that when we have a Prime Minister we ought to vote him a salary, and an adequate salary. It is said that the Prime Minister has no constitutional existence. He has a constitutional existence, not by statute but by usage. If the right hon. Gentleman would bring forward a motion such as he suggested, giving a salary to the Prime Minister, so far as I am concerned&#x2014;and I think I speak for many hon. Gentlemen on this side of the House&#x2014;we are perfectly prepared to support it. I am ready to withdraw my Amendment if the right hon. Gentleman will carry out his own proposal, withdraw this Vote and propose an adequate salary for the Prime Minister. I beg to move the reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;758.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01210">Original Question put, and agreed to.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01211">Resolutions to be reported.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01212">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That a Supplementary sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;110,000, be granted to His Majesty, to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the:51st day of March, 1901, for Stationery. Printing, Paper, Binding, and Printed Books for the Public Service".</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01213"><member>MR. FLYNN</member><membercontribution> said that during the course of the discussion on these Supplementary Estimates they had had very extravagant sums to deal with; but the sum now asked for was sufficient to take away the breath of an ordinary Member of the House of Commons. A sum of &#x00A3;110,000 was asked for printing and binding books. One would have thought that all the books in the British Museum could have been printed and bound for that sum. It was time to realise the condition of things to which the House of Commons bad been reduced under the present Administration. Apparently the war was to be made the scapegoat for every extravagance, possible and impossible. It was to be made the excuse for Supple-
<col>290</col>
mentary Estimates absolutely without precedent. He defied the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to furnish a precedent for Supplementary Estimates of such magnitude as they were now considering. They had only recently discussed a Vote of over &#x00A3;17,000 for telegrams, which, however, might be accounted for by the high rates charged for telegrams to South Africa and West Africa; but, in his opinion, it was a most extravagant demand on the common sense of the country to ask for &#x00A3;110,000 for such a comparatively inexpensive article as paper, which, in the present days of cheap production, could be produced for a moderate sum. Was the Committee to be merely a body for registering the decrees of the Government? Ten years ago the Estimates were diligently, conscientiously, and carefully examined, but the House of Commons now had reached such a parlous condition &#x2014;partly owing to the manner in which the Opposition had abrogated its functions as the guardian of the rights of the tax-payer&#x2014;that all the Committee appeared able to do was to cheerfully vote the sums asked for by the Government. In the Vote before the Committee the amount asked for for printing for public departments was &#x00A3;233,000, the original Estimate being. &#x00A3;216,000. That was an
<image src="S4V0090P0I0263"/>
<col>291</col>
increase of &#x00A3;17,000. The next item&#x2014; paper for public departments&#x2014;showed an increase of &#x00A3;53,000, which certainly called for an explanation from the Secretary of the Treasury, without which he hoped the Committee would not have to vote it. He recognised that a somewhat exceptional condition of things existed, and that a demand had been made on the public service which would not have been made in ordinary circumstances, but he could not understand how a Supplementary Estimate should be so excessive as to be a fifth of the original Estimate, especially when such a comparatively cheap article as paper was concerned. The item for binding showed an increase of &#x00A3;8,500, although there was no information as to whether wages had increased. One of the disadvantages of the present position was that in previous Parliaments there was a Secretary to the Treasury who was competent to fill the position, and who had some knowledge of accounts. That position was now filled by a Minister, if he might call him so, who, from the condition of things, was a neophyte and an amateur, and could not give any explanation as to why the Estimates had been so extravagantly increased. He thought the Committee were entitled to something more than the scant courtesy and the bald explanation which had been given on previous Votes. He did not suppose there was any increase in the cost of material or labour, and surely there could not be such an enormous increase in the consumption of paper. An increase of &#x00A3;110,000 might be a small matter to hon. Members opposite, who displayed only the smallest Interest in the Estimates, and many of whom could not tell the difference between a Supplementary and an ordinary Estimate, but hon. Members from Ireland were very much concerned in the swollen Estimates which had been presented, and also in the unsatisfactory manner in which they had been submitted to the Committee. He trusted that they would have a satisfactory explanation from the Treasury as to how such an enormous increase had been incurred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01214"><member>MR. LOUGH <memberconstituency>(Islington, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he thought that such a large increase required more explanation than was given
<col>292</col>
on the Paper. The only explanation on the Paper was that the large increase was caused by the war, but the war was going on when the original Estimate was prepared. Why was not provision then made for the stationery required in South Africa, and if such provision were made how was it possible that such a large increase in the Estimate was now necessary? This Supplementary Estimate suggested to him what he thought was really the explanation of all the increased Votes they were considering. He believed that they had not had fair Estimates presented to them at the beginning of the financial year, and that every Estimate was squeezed in order to make up for the cost of the war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01215"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: I think there is one point which might give rise to misapprehension unless I deal with it at once. This is a Vote for the Stationery Office, but the whole of it is not required for articles ordinarily included in this Vote. Provision was made for the war when the original Estimate was framed, but the hon. Member for West Islington forgets, when he suggests that the war was in progress when we made the original Estimate, that that Estimate was framed in the last months of 1899, when it could not, be anticipated that the war would last so long, and no one can therefore be surprised that the provision which was then made for what is called stationery has proved insufficient for a war which is still going on. There are other items in the Vote which are not connected with the war, and which could not have been foreseen when the original Vote was framed. For instance, the Estimate was framed on the assumption that the census paper would be of the same quality as was used at the last census, but the Registrar General represented that a better class of paper would be required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01216"><member>MR. FLAVIN <memberconstituency>(Kerry, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: Would the hon. Gentleman say how much of the increase is due to the better census paper?</membercontribution></p>

<col>293</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01217"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: Yes, Sir; &#x00A3;600. If I may give another instance, I would mention the new forms of discharge required in the mercantile marine. The Stationery Office has to supply the demands of the other offices. I understand that a book instead of a loose paper is now required for the better protection of the mercantile marine, and that accounts for a sum of &#x00A3;1,300 of the extra Supplementary Estimate. I only mention these facts to show how the Estimate is made up, and also to show that these sums are sums which the Stationery Office could not have refused. With regard to the war, an enormous supply of paper is required for packing purposes as well as for stationery. There has been an increased expenditure for stationery in the ordinary sense of the word, and there has also been an increased demand for books of various kinds required on military service, as well as an increase in the printing for the Army in consequence of its increased size. Up to 1899 the War Office itself supplied all the paper it required for packing purposes, but since then the Stationery Office has been called upon to supply it. The items I have mentioned, and other items of a similar kind, account for the increased Vote, and I think there is very little in it that could have been foreseen. I cannot therefore accept the blame which the hon. Member for West Islington casts on the Stationery Office for not having foreseen this expenditure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01218"><member>SIR THOMAS ESMONDE</member><membercontribution> said the Vote gave him an opportunity of raising a question which he had long been anxious to raise, but which he was unable to bring forward before owing to the peculiar way in which the Estimate had been presented in recent years. Ireland would have to pay a large proportion of the Vote, and he should like to know what value she was to get for her money. He should like to ask the Secretary for the Treasury where the paper provided for in this Vote came from? He had seen some specimens of the paper on which the War Office did their correspondence, and certainly it
<col>294</col>
could not be much worse. He did not know whether it was made in Germany, but it was extraordinarily bad paper. He wished to know whether any of the paper purchased by the Stationery Office was made in Ireland, and whether Irish firms were given any facilities for tendering for contracts for paper. Extraordinarily good paper was made in Ireland. He did not know whether the paper used in the House of Commons was of Irish manufacture, but certainly quite as good paper was made in that country. He should like to receive an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that if Irish contractors had not been given an opportunity of tendering in the past, such opportunity would be given to them in the future. With reference to binding, that was one of the few arts still preserved in Ireland, and he would make the same request with regard to that. It seemed to him that a certain amount of the public expenditure such as was mentioned in the Estimate might be spent in Ireland with great advantage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01219"><member>MR. TULLY</member><membercontribution> said he thought that the Secretary to the Treasury when he was explaining the Vote forgot that the total Estimate for 1900&#x2013;1 was over &#x00A3;600,000, whereas the Estimate for 1889&#x2013;9 was only &#x00A3;498,000. There had therefore been an increase of over &#x00A3;100,000, exclusive of the increase which had been put down to the war. The total amount now to be voted for printing and stationery was nearly three-quarters of a million. When the President of the Board of Agriculture was Secretary to the Treasury, he boasted in 1898 that he had reduced the figures for that year by &#x00A3;50,000, but instead of any decrease being effected in the present year there was an increase of &#x00A3;110,000, without any adequate explanation. The hon. Gentleman said that the Stationery Office was getting a better class of paper, but the better quality of paper had not fluctuated very much in price. It was the cheaper qualities of paper that were affected by the war. The war interfered with wood pulp paper, because steamers were taken for transport
<image src="S4V0090P0I0265"/>
<col>295</col>
purposes, and also because there was a rise in the price of chemicals. When the President of the Board of Agriculture was Secretary to the Treasury, he went direct to the mills instead of going to contractors, but he could not get any tenders from the mills, because they were warned that if they tendered they would he boycotted by the contractors. Owing to transactions such as that, the Government were unable to obtain paper from the mills, with the result that &#x00A3;11 0.000 had to be added to the Estimates in one year. When the President of the Board of Agriculture was striving to reduce these enormous figures, all sorts of difficulties were put in his way. He attempted to get the reporting of the House of Commons done cheaper, and the plan was adopted of slinging a cheap contract at his head. He went in for getting a low tender, and got a very bad contractor, who made a complete mess of the printing and publishing the debates of the House. By that means discredit was sought to be cast on the President of the Board of Agriculture because of his efforts to reduce the expenditure of the Stationery Office. He thought some explanation should have been given as to why &#x00A3;110,000 had to be added to the original Estimate, information should also be given as to who were the contractors for the supply of stationery used in the public Departments. Had the hon. Gentleman the present Secretary to the Treasury attempted to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor? Did he go to the mills for paper; and if he went to the mills, did he secure tenders; and if he did not, did not that prove that the ring which existed in the old days still existed? Although nearly three-quarters of a million was expended in printing and stationery, if the public wanted a Blue-book an almost prohibitive price was put upon it. A Blue-book which now cost 6s. could, if produced in a sufficient quantity, be obtained for 3d. or 4d. If the hon. Gentleman would put Blue-books at a low price on the market, the result would prove very remunerative. A daily newspaper might cost &#x00A3;1,000 to produce, but it was sold at a 1d. or &#x00BD;d., whereas the Vote Office put on a Blue-book
<col>296</col>
the price they thought it cost to produce. They sold perhaps 500 books at one shilling, whereas if they offered 1,000 or 1,500 books at 6d. they would realise a substantial profit. He asked the hon. Gentleman whether he would not go in for such a system. He did not think there was any justification for the enormous increase now asked for. The better quality of paper used had very little to do with it, and if the money was not spent on paper, did it go as wages? The rate of wages for compositors had not increased in London. On the contrary, an effort was made to reduce it, and therefore no part of the increase went to the working man. He noticed that "Small Stores" were responsible for &#x00A3;29,000 of the increase. It was very convenient in drawing up an Estimate to cloak a lot of things under the title of "Small Stores." He did not think such an item could justify an increased expenditure of &#x00A3;29,000. Then there was an increase of &#x00A3;1,000 for parchment, and an increase of &#x00A3;53,000 for paper. He could not accept such items.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S4V0090P0I0267"/>
<col>299</col>
under-ballasting of ships has been before I your Lordships' House. On the two former occasions, in February, 1898,&#x2020; I went very fully into the subject, and gave instances of vessels that were nearly lost, and one that was lost, for want of sufficient ballast. I also read to your Lordships a number of letters, or extracts from letters, from captains of ships, all setting forth the great danger of under-ballasting. I have received a great number of letters since from captains on the same subject and to the same effect. They point out the great danger that is run, and how very helpless an unballasted ship is in bad weather. They also give a number of cases where the vessels have been lost or severe damage done, and refer to the very-narrow escapes of others all due to the want of sufficient ballast. In short, the universal opinion amongst ship captains is that they are far safer in an over laden vessel than in one that is under-laden, as in the former ease the ship is at least under command, while in the latter case they are completely helpless and can do nothing.<lb/>
While the Board of Trade is quite satisfied with the competency of these captains to command their ships and to take charge of lives and of an immense amount of very valuable property, yet they treat their opinions on this subject with contempt, and attach no importance to them. Therefore, my Lords, it would be useless for me to take up your time by reading&#x2014;with the exception of two&#x2014;any more extracts from their letters; but I would remind your Lord-ships that an underladen vessel is not only in danger herself, but is a great source of danger to others. Masters of cross-channel steamers, both in the English and Irish Channels, have told me how utterly helpless these under-ballasted vessels are in bad weather and how, when meeting such vessels, they have to take special care to give them a very wide berth. I will give your Lordships some opinions from other sources that may have more weight with the Board of Trade, though I think that the opinions of the captains who have handled these ships and seen their behaviour in all sorts and conditions of
<quote>&#x2020; See <i>The Parliament Debated</i> [Fourth Series], Vol. liii., pages 615 and 1506.</quote>
<col>300</col>
weather are most valuable and deserving of the highest consideration.<lb/>
I will commence by giving the opinion of a shipbuilder. At a meeting of the Institute of Naval Architects, held on 21st duly, 1899, under the presidency of Sir Edward J. Reed, K.C.B. M.P., Mr. G B. Hunter (an eminent shipbuilder), in the course of a paper on "Large Atlantic Cargo Steamers. "stated that&#x2014;
<quote>"It is recorded in Lloyd's list that 173 steamships were disabled in 1898, mostly in the Atlantic, through failure of shafting. It is stated that fifty-three similar accidents occurred in April, May, and June of this year (1899). This can, I think, be regarded as highly unsatisfactory. The cause usually as signed for these accidents is the practice of steaming outwards from European to American ports in ballast, and generally with very insufficient ballast."</quote>
In the discussion which followed there was a consensus of opinion in favour of Mr. Hunters remarks, Colonel Swan, another eminent shipbuilder, stating that he was quite in accord with the general conclusions of Mr. Hunter, particularly so in reference to the ballasting of large ships. It had he said, always been a surprise to him that shipowners and underwriters had been content for so long to allow vessels to be sent across the Atlantic so insufficiently ballasted. As a need generally produces a remedy, so in this case Mr. McGlashan's ballast tanks and Captain Chaddock s patent hatch have been brought out to enable vessels to take sufficient ballast at a comparatively small cost. I hear that some modern vessels have been fitted with these tanks, and give great satisfaction. I now come to the underwriters. The following is a letter I have received from the Secretary of Lloyd's&#x2014;
<quote>"The Committee of Lloyd's have heard with pleasure that your Lordship is about to introduce the Light Load-line Bill into the House of Lords, and the Committee request me to assure you of their approval of the principle of the Bill, which is evidently called for by the number of vessels which the Committee have to declare as missing, involving sometimes a heavy loss of life. The Committee trust that the proposed Bill may meet with the support which it undoubtedly deserves."</quote>
The Secretary of the Liverpool Underwriters' Association sends the following communication&#x2014;
<quote>"This matter was considered by my committee to-day, and I am instructed to say that
<image src="S4V0090P0I0268"/>
<col>301</col>
they consider that the losses arising from vessels sailing with insufficient and improperly secured ballast are so serious as to warrant legislation on the subject, and they cordially approve the principle embodied in Lord Muskerry's Light Load-line Bill."</quote>
I will now quote the opinion given by Sir Edward Reed, who was at one time Constructor to the Royal Navy. He stated that the only vessel he ever owned was lost through the neglect of the managers in sending her round the coast with insufficient ballast. Another naval architect, Mr. H. B. Wortley, in the course of a very interesting paper read before the Shipping Masters' and Officers' Society on the subject of "Ballasting,"said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is quite impossible to dwell too forcibly upon the evils of sending ships to sea insufficiently immersed, and the disasters of the past winter have been quite sufficient alone to emphasise this. The under-load-line record for 1898, as published by the <i>Syren</i>, represents a mass of human life and capital at stake which is appalling in its immensity."</quote>
From a captain's letter just recently written, in making a passage across the Atlantic Ocean, I quote the following&#x2014;
<quote>"I trust that the Light Load-line Bill will very shortly be an accomplished fact. Here I am with no ballast, except the ordinary water ballast and just sufficient coal to take me to my destination, rolling rails under, and with a beam wind, just going to leeward like a mere balloon on the water, our draft being lift, 6in. It is enough to give one softening of the brain. Perhaps you think I have it for coming, but the precious dollar has to be earned."</quote>
I do not think that any one of your Lordships would like to have been in that vessel; and I may say that all Tinder-ballasted vessels behave in exactly the same way. Here is a letter I have received from another captain&#x2014;
<quote>"When acting as chief officer of the S.S. 'Rutherglen' whilst in ballast, to save her from going on the Lizards we had to keep her going full speed astern for about six hours, the vessel being totally unmanageable. Also, when master of the S.S. 'Drummond' in ballast, bound from the Continent to Barry, the vessel could not be handled, and in endeavouring to round the Land's End we had to put back to Falmouth no less than three times."</quote>
The Institute of Marine Engineers has lately devoted two or three meetings to the consideration of this question. It involves no disrespect to the Institute to say that among its members there is a diversity of opinion as to the relative
<col>302</col>
importance of the several causes which tend to produce shaft failure. On one point, however, there appears to be pretty general agreement, and that is that an increase both in the size and durability of the shaft is not necessarily a guarantee of safety when vessels are persistently driven across the Atlantic with insufficient ballast.<lb/>
Now, my Lords, I will take the opinion of two of His Majesty's judges. Mr. Justice Barnes, dealing with a case that came before him, said&#x2014;
<quote>"Nearly every salvage case which we get now is owing to the breakage of the propeller."</quote>
Mr. Justice Phillimore said&#x2014;
<quote>"There is nothing more dangerous to life and property than this practice, of sending vessels on winter voyages in these northern seas without ballast, and if the owners bat to pay he was not at all sorry, and if the underwriters had to pay it was their own fault for incurring such risks."</quote>
These are the views of two judges who have had a good deal of opportunity of entering into these matters. My noble friend the Earl of Dudley, when replying to me on a former occasion, stated that the Board of Trade surveyors had full power to detain any ship that was insufficiently ballasted. That may be so but how are they to judge unless they have some guide, such as this Bill proposes? You would surely not expect these surveyors to go on board a ship just before sailing and make an intricate calculation as to the depth the vessel should be immersed to be safe. Do you think they will take that responsibility? I venture to say they will not, and you cannot blame them for refusing. When I spoke on this subject in February, 1898, I asked if the Board of Trade was going to wait till some vessel was lost from want of sufficient ballast before they took action. I will now quote some of the casualties from the official reports of the Board of Trade. In the case of the "Nonpareil" the court of inquiry held at the Town Hall, Westminster, December last, stated that the vessel was not prematurely abandoned, and that the cause of her loss was that she was insufficiently ballasted to withstand the weather she encountered; no lives were lost by this casualty,

The inspector (Captain A.

<col>304</col>

The inspector (Captain William Erskine) appointed by the Board of Trade, in his report to them after the inquiry, state that the ballast was not sufficient in quantity to immerse the vessel so as to ensure her safe handling in a seaway in violent squalls, or in heavy weather.'"</quote>
There are also at the present moment four ships&#x2014;the "Andrada, "the "Bertha, "the "Cape Wrath," and the "Ratlidown"&#x2014;who sailed in ballast, and are long overdue, and still missing. My noble friend will doubtless point out to me that most of these ships sailed from foreign ports. That is quite true, but had they been marked as this Bill proposes, it would have been a guide to the masters in the same way as the present deep-load mark is, and the ships would have gone to sea properly ballasted. One hundred and sixty-five lives have been lost, and how many perhaps in the four ships that are missing now&#x0021; Who is responsible? I say the Board of Trade. I do not wish to impute any blame to my noble friend. He does not give his own views on these matters, but speaks for the body he so ably represents in your Lordships' House. In all the dealings I have had with him on this and kindred subjects he has always shown the greatest courtesy and kindness, and I am sure that personally he would be only too anxious and willing to do all in his power to further the interests of the mercantile marine. Other officers of the Board of Trade in private life I am sure are very estimable gentlemen, lint taking the Board of Trade as a concrete body. I say it is morally guilty of the manslaughter of these 165 people. Had the, Board of Trade accepted three years ago my proposal to place this light load-line mark on ships, in all human probability these lives would not have been lost. If a fair proportion of these unfortunate people had been passengers, the press of the country would have rung with the disasters, the Government would have been asked why ships were allowed to go to sea in so unseaworthy a condition,
<image src="S4V0090P0I0270"/>
<col>305</col>
and the Board of Trade themselves would have been forced by pressure, of public opinion to introduce a similar measure&#x2014; perhaps a much stronger one&#x2014;to the one now before your Lordships. Can I, can anyone, bring forward stronger or more convincing arguments in favour of this Bill than those 165 poor creatures who have gone to what I may call a nameless grave for want of it? They were not passengers whose names would have been published and their loss commented upon; they were only sailors earning their living. Who knows their names? The Register of Shipping should, I think, have a list of the crews, the friends they left behind, the wives and children who were dependent on some of them for their daily bread. Would you, my Lords, or would the general public outside shipping circles, over have heard of these deaths if the matter had not been brought before your Lordships' House? It is terrible to think how much sorrow, how much misery has been brought about for the want of a simple precaution. I am sure the noble Lord who represents the shipowners will not now oppose this Bill. I "Cannot believe that they would ever dream of putting pecuniary interest in the balance against human life. At the best of times a sailor's life is a hard one; the unavoidable risks he has to run are many and great; but when we find a great danger that is avoidable by legislating for it. surely it is our duty to do so. I earnestly hope you will pass the Second Reading of this Bill. It is a much-needed and urgent measure, and by doing so you will earn the gratitude of the whole seafaring community. I beg to move the Second Beading of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>

ships were lost principally through want of ballast and injury to shaft; but of those 185 cases, 95 were foreign ships, to which neither the Act of 1894 nor the present Bill could possibly apply, so that they must be deducted. That reduces the number of ships to 90, or one-half per cent, of the 20,209 vessels on the British Register in the Registrar General's return for 1899. But that is not all, because the noble Lord's Bill is directed to casualties to the shaft. Out of the total of 185, 35 of the casualties or damages are described as due to broken propellers and not broken shafts, and I am informed that nearly every steamer afloat carries a spare propeller. I hope, therefore, that your Lordships will not allow these statistics to weigh with you in considering this Bill. I have thought it right to explain them after the inferences drawn by the noble Lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01243"><member>*LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: The statistics are from the official reports of the Board of Trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01244"><member>*LORD HENEAGE</member><membercontribution>: I submit that, the Bill is unnecessary; that the settlement of the load-line question in 1891, after most careful inquiry by a committee of experts presided over by Sir Edward Reed, is working satisfactorily, and that the proposal in the Bill is utterly impracticable. The noble Lord does not fix the place where the light load-line is to be, except in vague and general terms, but this is the very essence of his proposal. The noble Lord leaves the level to the Board of Trade. I doubt if my noble friend who represents that Department will show due gratitude for his confidence, but I will leave him to deal with that point. The load-line was fixed by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894. The sections dealing with this question are from 436 to 445 inclusive, but Sections 437and 438 have alone any connection with this Bill. Section 437 relates to the marking of deck-lines, and enacts that every British merchant ship over eighty tons shall be permanently and conspicuously marked with lines&#x2014;in this Act called deck-lines&#x2014;of not less than twelve inches in length and one inch in breadth, painted longitudinally on each side
<image src="S4V0090P0I0271"/>
<col>307</col>
amidships, or as near thereto as is practicable, and indicating the position of each deck which is above water. There are other directions as to colour and position of the deck-lines, which are to be white or yellow on a dark ground and black on a light ground. Section 438 deals with the marking of the load-line under the special direction of the Board of Trade as to the level and position of the disc. The owner of the vessel before proceeding to sea&#x2014;
<quote>"Shall mark upon each of her sides amidships, within the meaning of Section 437, or as near thereto as practicable, in white or yellow on a dark ground, or in black on a light ground, a circular disc 12 inches in diameter, with an horizontal line 18 inches in length down through its centre."</quote>
Your Lordships will therefore observe that the load-line is essentially different from the deck-lines in Section 437, which are for an entirely different object and must not be confused with the load-line. But what is the proposal of the Bill? The noble Lord by his Bill proposes to add a second load-line to be called the "light load-line" identical with the present load-line, but marked on every vessel within the meaning of the Act of 1894 below the deck-lines prescribed by the Act. This, we say, is absolutely unnecessary and it is not only an addition to but. a revolution of the law, and would create confusion and hardship to British shipowners without reasonable cause. The present law has worked, we contend, satisfactorily.<lb/>
If the responsible Department of the Board of Trade consider legislation necessary, let them legislate. I think the noble Lord has failed to show any necessity for the introduction of the Bill, and I deny that vessels are sent to sea so light as to be in a dangerous condition. I am sure we all desire to give the noble Lord every credit for his good intentions, with the object of saving life and property at sea; but we ask your Lordships to pause before you disturb the well-considered settlement of the load-line laws in 1894 without any apparent necessity whatever. Even if the Bill passed it would only apply to British shipowners, and thus handicap them still further in competition with foreign
<col>308</col>
vessels. We urge that it would be most unfair to harass the trade because less than one-half per cent, of the registered British vessels have met with accidents to their shafts, especially when Lloyd's Register in 1900 made amendments in their rules with a view of reducing the number of accidents to shafts in British vessels.<lb/>
Where does the noble Lord propose to place his minimum or light load-line? According to him it is to be placed at the minimum depth to which a vessel may be navigated under any circumstances. Therefore it must lie placed in a position suitable for vessels being moved in ballast along the coast; the same line has to do for a voyage across the Atlantic and also when vessels are going in ballast round Cape' Horn. It does not require to be a seaman to know that under those varying circumstances the immersion would differ. I will leave the noble Earl who represents the Board of Trade to defend that Department from the attack that has been made upon it. That is not part of my duty. But I venture to say, on behalf of shipowners., that they believe the Bill to be absolutely unnecessary and impractical le and that it would prove a delusion and a snare if it became an Act of Parliament. For these reasons I move the rejection of the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01245">Moved, to leave out "now" and insert at the end of the motion "this day six months."&#x2014;(<i>The Lord Heneage.</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01246"><member>THE EARL OF GLASGOW</member><membercontribution>: My Lords. I beg to associate myself with the noble Lord who has just spoken, and to second the motion for the rejection of the Bill. The Bill was moved in a very able speech by the noble Lord, who spoke in a very sympathetic manner with regard to the difficulties and the dangers which seamen have to encounter. As a sailor myself. I agree with a great deal he said, but I think the noble Lord fell into the not uncommon error of rather overstating his case. When he spoke so forcibly and strongly upon the loss of life which occurs through vessels being under-ballasted, he did not tell you how very small is the number of ships that are lost under those circumstances. I am in formed that of
<image src="S4V0090P0I0272"/>
<col>309</col>
all the vessels that went to sea in the year 1900, only one-half per cent, suffered any casualties through being under-ballasted.<lb/>
There are other considerations which move me to oppose this Bill. It must be remembered that none of the great shipping companies send their vessels to sea under-ballasted. This condition of things obtains chiefly in connection with ships of the tramp class, that wander round the world trying to get a cargo and have great difficulty in making both ends meet. It is on the owners of these ships that the hardships would fall if this Bill passed. The result would be that the ships would have to be sold, and would probably fall into the hands of foreign nations. Under the new orders of the Board of Trade certificates are not given to vessels that are not equipped with much stronger propellers and shafts than used to be allowed, and, in addition to that regulation, there are new methods of providing water-ballast. This is being-adopted in all new vessels, and will render such accidents as have occurred hitherto less likely in the future. Therefore I think the evils to which the noble Lord has referred will gradually diminish as time goes on. We must remember that to shipowners, perhaps more so than to any other class, time is money, and that the time that would be lost by them in taking in ballast to go from port to port would be precious time. British shipowners would be handicapped in their competition with foreign shipowners if this Bill passed, and I therefore trust that your Lordships will refuse to give it a Second Reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01247"><member>*LORD KELVIN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, unless stronger arguments are put before the House than those we have already heard, it does appear to me that an exceedingly strong case has been made out in favour of the Bill. I cannot see any of the difficulties which have been described nor how the Bill can possibly be injurious to British shipmasters. I know it is urged against it that it will apply only to British-owned ships, and that foreign shipowners will be allowed with impunity to risk the safety of their ships and the lives of those on board by not complying with the conditions which this Bill seeks to impose. That appears to me no argument at all. The Bill gives a simple provision, and
<col>310</col>
one which cannot be inconvenient or expensive, or cause the detention of any ship which ought not to be detained, but which will make British ships and the lives of those on board safer than they would be without such legislation. That is in my opinion, a very strong reason for passing it; unless we hear something satisfactory from the noble Lord who represents the Board of Trade in this House, in respect to official action, to secure the objects for which the Bill is intended.<lb/>
We are told that there is a very strong wish that there should be no alteration in the present load-line law. It docs not seem to me that any good reason for wishing no change in the present law has been submitted to your Lordships' House. The deep load-line mark was carried after much opposition. We all remember how the Plimsoll load-line was opposed, but we are now assured that it has proved most beneficial. In my opinion, if this Bill is carried it also will prove beneficial. What possible confusion can there be between two marks, oven if they are of the same shape and colour&#x2014;one for the deep load-line and the other for the light load-line? I intend to support the Bill unless I hear arguments which convince me that it ought not to be supported.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01248"><member>THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I came down to the House with a perfectly unprejudiced mind on this question, but it occurs to me that the opposition to this Bill is illogical. In my opinion, the arguments which were adduced by the noble Lord who moved the Second Reading have not been at all answered by my noble friend who moved the rejection of the Bill. I can quite understand the arguments which were used against the Plimsoll line and which were directed against any interference with the liberty of shipmasters to do what they liked with their ships, or the arguments which were adduced against the danger of interfering with and adding difficulties to the competition of British shipowners with the owners of foreign vessels. But as the Legislature have thought it wise to protect seamen against the dangers of overloading, it seems perfectly logical and equally necessary to protect them against the dangers they incur by the ship being insufficiently ballasted. I do not pretend to say whether the Bill in
<image src="S4V0090P0I0273"/>
<col>311</col>
its details is workable or not. The noble Lord opposite (Lord Heneage) said that confusion would arise on account of the two discs. That is a matter of detail; but I think it would be perfectly easy to place the marks in such a way as not to cause inconvenience. Unless I hear stronger arguments against it, I shall certainly support the Bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01249"><member>THE SECRETARY TO THE BOARD OF TRADE (The Earl of DUDLEY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I do not suppose that the House is desirous that this debate should be prolonged very much longer, as I know that some anxiety may be evinced to get on to the next item upon the Paper. But as this is a matter which comes under the purview of the Board of Trade, and as considerable reference has been made by noble Lords who have already spoken to the attitude previously adopted by the Board of Trade. I hope that I. may be excused if I take up the attention of the House for a few minutes in this connection.<lb/>
I may say at once that those who have looked into this matter at the Board of Trade are of opinion that at the present time there is no necessity for legislation upon the lines of this Bill. I venture to say, as a general principle, that legislation of this kind, which seeks to impose an arbitrary restriction upon a great industry like the shipping industry, and which is at any rate opposed by a huge proportion of those who carry on that industry and who own ships, can only be justified if a very strong case is made out in its favour and if it is shown that considerable loss of life has occurred from the present state of things. My noble friend who introduced this Bill told the House that at the present time a great number of accidents occur to the machinery of vessels owing to those vessels being insufficiently immersed in the water. He quoted a few cases of accidents, which I shall refer to presently. I wish that he had told us how many vessels, in his opinion, suffer accident in the course of the year from reasons of this kind. I believe that the number, if you compare it with the total accidents to our shipping, is not large. A list has been circulated, to which reference has already been made, giving the number of accidents to the machinery of steam
<col>312</col>
vessels during 1900 as 185. I am quite prepared, as a basis of argument, to take that figure as correct; but I would, in the first place, point out that, even if 185 vessels did suffer accident to their machinery last year through this cause&#x2014;which I do not admit&#x2014;it only constitutes about a half per cent, of the total of the world's shipping. Therefore the evil, looked at from the worst point of view, is not a great one, and it cannot be said that it is at any rate up to now of great pressing importance.<lb/>
I would go further. I would say that, even if these accidents to machinery take place, what my noble friend has to prove is that considerable risk or even loss of life occurs from the present state of things. I would submit to the House that accidents to machinery do not in themselves constitute a ground for legislation. Of course, if it can be shown that those accidents result in loss of life, or even considerable risk to life, then no doubt Parliament would only be following many precedents in dealing with the matter, but until this can be shown the question is one which concerns owners underwriters, and engineers much more than your Lordships' House.<lb/>
I would call attention for a moment to the list to which reference has been made. We hear that 185 steamers suffered accident last year through the failure of their propelling machinery but of those 185 cases thirty seven are recorded as having lost their propellers. I am informed that if a vessel loses its propeller it does not at all follow that it is due to any excessive strain upon the machinery. A vessel may lose her propeller from many causes, even a fully laden vessel. So common a type of accident is it that nearly all vessels now many an extra propeller in order to guard against that contingency. Therefore I do not think those who support this Bill can say that accidents of this character are due to the absence of legislation of this kind. If we eliminate these thirty-seven cases, there remain 148 steamers which suffered accident last year principally of the kind known as tail-shaft breakages. A large proportion, however, of these ships were foreigners, and as has already been pointed out. We cannot, of course, touch 'foreign vessels. Deducting the foreigners,
<image src="S4V0090P0I0274"/>
<col>313</col>
we have only to consider the ease of seventy-six British vessels which suffered accident to their machinery last year from this cause.<lb/>
Two questions, therefore, arise in connection with these seventy-six vessels&#x2014; firstly, were the accidents due to under-ballasting; and, secondly, did those accidents involve risk to life? With regard; to the first point, what we are told is that at the present time ships in ballast, go to sea so light that when they encounter heavy weather the propeller comes out of the water, the engines race, and the consequent strain upon the machinery is so great that in many cases the tail-shaft breaks. My noble friend who introduced this Bill seems to think that the Board of Trade takes up a contemptuous attitude with regard to opinion upon this subject. I can assure him that since this subject was brought forward two or three years ago I have taken all the advice I could get about it. I have consulted not only the professional member of the Marine Department of the Board of Trade, who is himself a seaman of considerable experience, but also the surveying officers around the coast, and although it cannot be said that in no case is under-ballasting a contributing cause of tail-shaft breakage, yet it is quite inaccurate to say that it is a sole or even a principal cause of accidents. I am informed that there must always be some danger of excessive strain on the propelling machinery, especially in these days of large steamers, and a certain number of accidents from this cause must always be expected. It is worth noticing that only twenty vessels were recorded as having suffered accident from this cause last year, and those accidents arose in many cases from causes that the ballasting and immersion in the water had nothing to do with&#x2014;causes, for instance, such as the faulty materials of which the shafts themselves were made. In this connection I should like, with the permission of the House, to read an extract from a letter which we received only a day or two ago from one of the most trusted surveyors of the Board of Trade, lie says&#x2014;
<quote>"I am not at all satisfied that these break-ages and losses are the result of under-ballasting. Take last year's list of such casualties. A considerable number of them occurred to laden vessels&#x2014;large liners and others. I think
<col>314</col>
the material from which a number of tail-shafts are made has a lot to do with these breakages, and shipowners and others are becoming alive to the fact, and are insisting on nothing but the best iron being used in their construction."</quote>
Your Lordships will see from this letter that the, question of shaft breakages is largely an engineering one, and that they arise from causes which may be uncertain, but which are undoubtedly manifold. I do not think, therefore, that the fact that a certain number of vessels have come to grief in this way during last year, or any year, is in itself an argument in favour of legislation which only aims at one particular aspect of the problem. As my noble friend Lord Heneage has already pointed out, there is no need to fear that this question will be overlooked, as the attention of shipowners and underwriters has been directed to it for some time; and Lloyd s Register have introduced rules which there is every reason to hope will be speedily effective.<lb/>
So much for the question of tail-shaft breakages. I hope that I have said enough to show that at any rate it cannot be said that under-ballasting leads to more than a few cases of accident of that kind. But the question still remains whether in those few cases loss of life occurs. My noble friend who introduced this Bill told the House that 165 deaths had ensued from this cause. I do not know where the noble Lord gets his figures from.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01250"><member>LORD MUSKERRY</member><membercontribution>: From the official reports of the Board of Trade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01251"><member>THE EARL OF DUDLEY</member><membercontribution>: So far as I am aware, there is no Report of the Board of Trade which attributes a single death directly to this cause. The only way in which we can get a satisfactory answer to this question is by an examination of the casualty inquiries during a period of years. For this purpose a summary of the casualty inquiries for the last nine years&#x2014;from 1892 to 1900&#x2014;has been made out for me at the Board of Trade. I find that out of a total of 895 inquiries held, in only twenty cases has there been any question of under-ballasting raised. In ten of these cases, however, the Court was of opinion that the vessels were
<image src="S4V0090P0I0275"/>
<col>315</col>
sufficiently ballasted. Of the other ton oases four were steamers and six were sailing vessels; and even in four of these cases, though it is true that the inspector was of opinion that when the vessel started on its voyage it was insufficiently ballasted, yet it is, of course, quite problematic whether or not the vessel was lost from that cause. I do not say that these four vessels were not lost through insufficient ballast, but I do say that to assume they were is assuming a great deal.<lb/>
Therefore, if we take merely the cases of which we have full and complete evidence, we come down to this, that in nine years four steamers and two sailing vessels have been stranded owing, in the opinion of the Court, to insufficient ballast, and in not one of these six cases has a single life been lost. I therefore hope that the House will agree with me that the risk of life is at present so small from the particular reason we are now discussing that it is really needless to pass this Bill. Noble Lords who have already spoken have alluded to the practicability of the proposals. I do not think that there is any difficulty at all in fixing such a line as the noble Lord suggests but I would point out that the Board of Trade has no means of carrying out that step. The maximum load-line was fixed by a Committee which sat on the subject under the chairmanship of Sir Edward Reed, and a similar inquiry would be necessary to give effect to the noble Lord's proposal for a minimum load-line. It would be impossible for us at the Board of Trade to carry out legislation of this character without some previous inquiry by a Committee.<lb/>
I should like to say this in conclusion. Reference has been made to the fact that there are certain powers at present in existence under the Merchant Shipping-Act for detaining ships. Both the noble Lord opposite who moved the rejection of the Bill and the noble Lord who moved its adoption were of opinion that the Board of Trade has power to detain vessels which have insufficient ballast. That is not so. We have power to detain vessels which are from any cause unsafe, and if a vessel was obviously unsafe from being too light it is natural to assume that she would be detained
<col>316</col>
under the present law. The President of the Board of Trade is about to issue a circular to all surveying officers on this point, and I can assure the House that if a vessel attempted to go to sea in an obviously unsafe condition she would be detained by our officers. The Government sympathise entirely with my noble friend Lord Muskerry in the efforts that he has on more than one occasion made to improve the lot of the merchant seaman, and to decrease the dangers of his arduous avocation; but in this particular instance I do think there is not sufficient ground for the somewhat drastic proposals which he has made. Therefore, if the Bill is pressed to a division. I. for one, shall feel compelled, to vote against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01252"><member>*LORD NORTON</member><membercontribution>: I should like to say a word or two following upon the statement of the noble Earl. Perhaps I may plead a right to say something, having myself passed the existing load-line. I passed it many years ago and the experiment has proved most successful. I passed it against exactly the same arguments which are now being adduced against the proposal for a light load-line. I confess that I came down to the House to-day not having made up my mind which view to take with regard to this particular Bill. After hearing the arguments on both sides I confess that I agree with what was said by my noble friend Lord Dunraven. In my opinion, more futile arguments were never adduced against any legislation than those which have been put forward against this Bill. Everyone admits the danger of ships going to sea overloaded or under loaded. The noble Lord who introduced the Bill referred to the official reports of the Board of Trade. The noble Earl who represents that Department disputes them, and says that many of those casualties cannot be proved to have occurred through vessels being under-ballasted.<lb/>
I do not suppose anyone who knows anything about shipping matters can doubt the danger arising from ships going to sea in such a condition. It is a palpable fact that a ship under-ballasted is quite unmanageable. It is clear that the remedy suggested in this Bill is suited to prove effective. The present
<image src="S4V0090P0I0276"/>
<col>317</col>
load-line has by experience proved of great benefit, and it is probable that the establishment of a light load-line would alike contribute to save sailors from parallel danger. The noble Earl who represents the Board of Trade said there was no necessity for this Bill. What amount of loss of life does lie require to make it necessary? That argument would be good against any kind of assurance whatever. I say there is no difficulty in this proposal. The noble Lord who moved the rejection of the Bill asked how the proposal in the Bill was to be carried out. He asked if the surveyors of the Board of Trade were to measure every single ship, but at the same time he said it was perfectly easy for any surveyor to refuse to allow a</membercontribution></p>

I believe it can be said with accuracy that, at present, only War Office officials are in a position to understand the working of our military administration, which has never been fully explained to Parliament.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01259">The noble Marquess who was Secretary of State for War in 1895, when the Government reorganised their military administration, said in your Lordships' House that he was not then able to give a full and final account of the proposals of the Government, but could merely give a brief and imperfect sketch of the main outlines of the new system. This brief sketch has never been followed by the full and final account of which the noble Marquess spoke. At present the only source of information is to be found in the Orders in Council. Orders in Council come, and Orders in Council go, in bewildering succession. Their appearance and their exit are conveniently recorded in the official preface to the War Office List, from which I have made the following extracts&#x2014;
<quote>"An Order in Council of December, 1887, was slightly, but not essentially, varied by one of February, 1888. By a further Order in Council of November, 1895, a new administration was established, but the Central Office was not affected by this order, and the part relating to the Financial Secretary merely repeated the Order of 1888. An Order in Council of March, 1899, revoked the Order of 1895."</quote>
So much, then, for the Orders in Council as they appear in the War Office List, changing and revoking each other and altering the administration of the Army. The Order of 1899 contains the latest definitions of the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and the principal officers of the Headquarters Staff. But these definitions are necessarily general, and deficient in detail. The first paragraph of the Order endows the Commander-in-Chief with the general command of the Army. The four suc-
<col>320</col>
ceding paragraphs deprive him of control over the Headquarters Staff. Now, my Lords, in what sense can an officer be called Commander-in-Chief if he has not got control over the Headquarters Staff? We cannot tell whether the Commander-in-Chief has been or is the real adviser of the Secretary of State and the real head of the Army; we do not know his position and responsibilities in matters of finance; we are ignorant whether in time of war he is or is not discharged from a portion of his duties. On the outbreak of hostilities the Cabinet appoints a Commander-in-Chief in the field. This war Commander-in-Chief reports directly to the Secretary of State. Thus the duties of the peace Commander-in-Chief seem to lapse. It appears that, in addition to Orders in Council varying the administration of the Army, the Secretary of State for War may, as occasion requires, assume additional powers for dealing with special cases. For instance, it was notified at the end of January that the Secretary of State, in future, could place any officer on half pay for causes other than misconduct. A very well-known case in which this has recently been done will occur immediately to your Lordships. The question at once arises, Is there any limit to this assumption of special powers to enable a Secretary of State for War to solve in silenced difficulties of his own creation? To all officers in the Army, and to all those who mean to make the Army their profession, the answer is of supreme importance. I find, my Lords, that in 1887 a Commission appointed to report upon Warlike Stores reported upon the Secretary of State for War. Why that Minister was then classed as a "warlike store" I am not concerned to inquire. I merely quote to your Lordships from the Report of that Commission. The Royal Commission on Warlike Stores reported on 16th May, 1887.and said that&#x2014;
<quote>"The Secretary of State is charged with five great functions, any one of which would be sufficient to occupy the whole time of a man of first-rate industry, ability, and knowledge."</quote></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01260">A very few years later the Hartington Commission arrived at exactly the same conclusion in reference to the duties of the Commander-in-Chief. That officer
<image src="S4V0090P0I0278"/>
<col>321</col>
had duties placed upon him far in excess of the power of any one man to perform. The key-note of the Harrington Coin-mission was to lessen the power and diminish the responsibilities of the Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, the Commission recommended the abolition of that office. The Government decided to retain the name, but to practically abolish the office of Commander-in-Chief by transferring his responsibilities to the Secretary of State for War, in spite of the Report of the Commission of 1887 that that Minister was already completely overburdened. In 1895 the concentration of responsibility in the Commander-in-Chief was terminated in favour of co-ordinate authorities collectively responsible to the Secretary of State.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01261">As though to accentuate the responsibility of the Secretary of State for War, that Minister is empowered by Act of Parliament not only to appoint, but at his pleasure to remove, the Financial Secretary, who is his chief adviser on all questions of Army expenditure, responsible to him for the Army Estimates, and for the redistribution of the sums granted for the year. We do not know, we have no means of knowing, what sum the military experts have asked for, what they consider to be the absolutely necessary minimum, or any of the reasons which prompt them to ask for loss or more than usual. All we know is that a certain sum has been granted, which may be less by millions than the sum asked for, and that the Financial Secretary is subject to removal at the pleasure of the Secretary of State for War.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01262">A variety of boards, committees, and councils are mingled in the work of administration at the War Office. The Secretary of State for War. The Under Secretary, the Financial Secretary, together with the Headquarters Staff and the Commander-in-Chief, form the War Office Council. The Commander-in-Chief and the Headquarters Staff form the Army Board. But the decision of that Board, on appeal from any one of its members, may be reversed by the Secretary of State. The Commander-in-Chief, with two officers to assist him, carry out those duties which in Continental armies are discharged by one officer alone, the chief of the staff. Your
<col>322</col>
Lordships are aware that in 1895 the five-great officers of the Headquarters Staff of the Army were made directly and co-ordinately responsible to the Secretary of State for their different departments. They advise the Secretary of State directly upon all matters connected with their departments. Thus the Headquarters Staff of the Army is not the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, but the staff of the Secretary of State for War. Now the Headquarters Staff, sitting with the Commander-in-Chief as its head, forms the Army Board. Thus we have one staff serving two chiefs, the one a Cabinet Minister and the other a distinguished soldier. We have always believed from days of old that no man can serve two masters, for most undesirable results are certain to follow.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01263">Above the Secretary of State we have, in the first place, the Cabinet, and, in the second, the Committee of National Defence. We do not know the powers of this Committee, or its exact relations to the Secretary of State. It is said to meet occasionally and to keep no minutes. However, this Committee of National Defence is composed of most illustrious. Ministers, without any of the special knowledge and experience requisite for successfully organising the defence of a world-wide Empire. The action of the Secretary of State implies often the initiative, always the consent, of both the Cabinet and the Committee of National Defence. It is true that the Secretary of State is held responsible for the whole Army, but in purely military matters it is impossible to bring personal responsibility home to a civilian Secretary of State. That responsibility must devolve on subordinate officers, who are protected from all blame by the umbrella of collective authority, under which they wait unconcernedly till the clouds roll by. Individual responsibility in the War Office seems to begin and end with the rank of doorkeeper.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01264">I am not hopeful of any real reform of the Army unless the Government take the country fully and frankly into their confidence on the subject of Army administration. Popular enthusiasm, which is essential to the existence of a Volunteer Army, can only be aroused and maintained when the nation easily understands the way in which the Army
<image src="S4V0090P0I0279"/>
<col>323</col>
is administered. The Government must remember that, although we do not know the precise system which has governed the Army, we do know its exact result&#x2014; namely, the opening scenes of the South African War. We had administrative machinery designed to ensure victory and success. Under the test of war it turned out disaster and humiliation. Is it unreasonable to wish to know the exact construction of the machinery which gave results so unexpected and so Calamitous?</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01265">I apprehend that your Lordships will agree that there is a widespread wish in the country for legislative reform in the Army&#x2014;I say, my Lords, legislative reform as distinguished from administrative change. I am well aware that the Government cannot now make any announcement of their intentions for the future. But, my Lords, my contention is that a detailed explanation of our existing military administration would pave the way for legislative reform more usefully than a series of administrative changes launched haphazard from the War Office. The Secretary of State has already appointed two Departmental Committees, one to instruct him how to carry on the work of the Department over which he has just been called upon to preside, and the other to inquire into the exact position which the Yeomanry are to occupy in an organisation the principles of which are not yet determined. Departmental Committees have inquired into the condition of the War Office ever since the Crimean War. The cumulative result of the labours of those Committees are the disasters in South Africa, but my Lords, forty years of failure seem to count for nothing in the sight of the War Office, I presume because
<quote>"Hope springs eternal in the human breast: Committees never are, but always to be blest."</quote>
In conclusion, I beg to call your Lordships' attention to the apparent anomalies of the military administration, and to ask the noble Lord the Under Secretary of State for information on the subject.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01266"><member>*THE UNDER SECRETARY of STATE FOR WAR (Lord RAGLAN)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, it is with considerable diffidence
<col>324</col>
that I address myself to this question. In the first place, I was brought up as a soldier, I had the honour to serve in the same regiment as the noble Duke, I learned the lesson of discipline in early life, and it goes somewhat against the grain to have publicly to discuss the proceedings of high officials whom I have always looked upon with respect from a distance. In the second place, as your Lordships are aware, my official life has been short; I have only been at the War Office for a few months, and I am asked to explain the working of a great system of which I have hardly had time to grasp the outline. The chief accusation which the noble Duke brought against the War Office was that there was no such thing as responsibility. I should like to point out that the changes to which the noble Duke took exception were brought about solely with the view of giving more individual responsibility. We all know that the tendency of all great institutions, whether Government institutions or not, is towards excessive centralisation. That tendency is continually increasing, and requires to be fought against. These Departmental Committees to which the noble Lord takes such exception were chiefly formed with the object of endeavouring, as far as possible, to further a system of decentralisation. The noble Duke complained that the result of the present system is that all power has been removed from the Commander-in-Chief. If you have any system of decentralisation you must decentralise responsibility, and to decentralise responsibility you must decentralise power. No man can accept responsibility without accepting at the same time a certain amount of power. You must give it to him in order that he may lie able to exercise that responsibility.<lb/>
The four great department soft he War Office are the Adjutant General's department, the Quartermaster General's department, the department of the Inspector General of Fortifications, and the department of Director General of Ordnance. By the last reorganisation&#x2014; I quite agree with my noble friend there have been several&#x2014;those four departments were put under their respective heads, who were made absolutely responsible for the conduct of their respective
<image src="S4V0090P0I0280"/>
<col>325</col>
departments. That did not remove them from the supervision of the Commander-in-Chief, though they were removed from his control. Besides those four military departments there are the department of the Military Secretary and the department of the Director of Military Intelligence. The Military Secretary's department, as most of your Lordships are aware, deals with the appointment and retirement of officers, and so on, and these are matters which must come almost hourly under the immediate control of the Commander-in-Chief. The Military Intelligence department deals with military intelligence, with mobilisation, and with general staff preparation for war. It is also considered that that department should be under the direct control of the Commander-in-Chief. All these departments are under the supervision of the Commander-in-Chief; he can at any moment see papers he desires to see on any subject, and can send for any officer either inside the office or out of it. I cannot but think that the supervision of the Commander-in-Chief is exactly what the Commander-in-Chief chooses to make it. If the Commander-in-Chief were to attempt to control every department of the War Office, no mortal man could stand the strain for a week. Under the present conditions the responsibility, and therefore the power, was deputed to the heads of these departments. They have charge of the work which is to be executed in their departments, but the Commander-in-Chief is consulted when that work is boingmapped out. The head of the department does that work subject to the supervision of the Commander-in-Chief, who can see exactly what is happening.<lb/>
I will now come to the difference between control and supervision. Control consists in standing over a man while he does the work; supervision consists in telling that man to do the work, still having the right to impure how ho is getting on with it at any moment. Take, for instance, the case of a Commander-in-Chief in the field. He has a column under his own immediate personal command. That is under his control. He sends out a detachment under a general officer. He says to that general officer, "March from A to B. "That column then passes beyond the control of the
<col>326</col>
Commander-in-Chief, it becomes merely under his supervision. The control of the column remains in the hands of the general officer until he gets fresh orders from the supervising authority altering his plans. That is the difference between control and supervision as applied to the relations between the Commander-in-Chief and the other officers in the War Office.<lb/>
I now come to my own personal experiences. As far as I have seen, no question affecting discipline&#x2014;and I use the word "discipline "in its widest possible sense&#x2014;has been decided since I have been at the War Office without the Commander-in-Chief having been consulted. In many quarters capital has been made out of the fact that all the correspondence goes out in the name of the Secretary of State for War. That custom was adopted in deference to the views of high military authorities, but no great importance is attached to it, and the Secretary of State does not see why the correspondence should not be sent out in the name of the Department which sent it out. All the correspondence which comes into the War Office is addressed to the Under Secretary for War. The reason for that is that it all has to go to a central office to be registered. The Secretary of State sees no particular reason why the correspondence should not be addressed to the particular Department for which it is intended, but it would make no practical difference in the working of the system.<lb/>
With regard to the personal relations between the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief, I can say that every Paper which I have seen&#x2014;and I think I have seen most of them&#x2014;which referred in the slightest way to discipline or to any purely military subject apart from that of expenditure&#x2014;and even those in the great majority of cases&#x2014; had a note upon it to the effect that the Commander-in-Chief had seen it and agreed with it. Indeed, the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief were in daily, almost hourly, correspondence. My room lies between the rooms of those two high officials, and constantly throughout the day either the Secretary of State passes through my room to see the Commander-in-Chief, or the Commander-in-Chief passes through to see the Secre-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0281"/>
<col>327</col>
tary of State. There are times when I wish that their communications were not so constant.<lb/>
There seems to be an idea that the Orders in Council of 1895 and 1899 were brought in solely with the object of enabling the civilian element to overrule and usurp the position of the military element. I can assure my noble friend that that is wrong. The basis of the change then made was simply the decentralisation of responsibility, and in decentralising responsibility it was also necessary to decentralise power. The noble Duke alluded to the war in South Africa. I was not in office at the time to which the noble Duke alludes, but I must challenge him to produce his authority for saying that the deficiencies of the civilians at the War Office caused the disasters early in the war, and to give his authority to say that any supplies or any reinforcements that have been demanded by the military authorities have ever been refused by the civil authorities. I do not think he can.<lb/>
In conclusion, I have merely to say this. The Secretary of State for War represents the Cabinet, and the Cabinet in the long run must represent Parliament, which must decide all great questions of policy and control every single item of expenditure. Therefore, whatever arrangements are made at the War Office, the Secretary of State must in the long run be supreme. But I can assure your Lordships that there is no desire on the part of anyone, whether inside or outside the War Office, either civil or military, to detract in any way from the, position, or to belittle, the authority, of the Commander-in-Chief.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01267"><member>VISCOUNT WOLSELEY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I gladly avail myself of this opportunity to call your Lordships' serious attention to the novel and experimental Army system introduced a few years back, under which His Majesty's forces are. I cannot say commanded by a professional soldier, but administered by a civilian Secretary of State. I speak in the presence of many noble Lords who are or who have been soldiers, and who therefore clearly understand the great difference in the meaning of those two expressions&#x2014; "administration" and "command. "I do not think I mislead those who have not
<col>328</col>
been soldiers when I state that in all countries and in all ages standing armies have been controlled by professional soldiers, who, above all things, were personally responsible for the discipline and war training, and, consequently, for the military efficiency of the troops they commanded. The only exceptions to this rule ever attempted, as far as my military knowledge goes, are, the Chinese army&#x2014; not a very good pattern to follow&#x2014;and our own Army, which for the last five years has been administered by a civilian Secretary of State, and not actually commanded by a soldier, as it had always previously been.<lb/>
I shall try, my Lords, to make my statements as general and impersonal as possible. I shall adduce no specific instances nor quote any particular correspondence to illustrate what I say. My arguments are not directed against individuals, but against a military system which I have honestly tried for five years and found wanting&#x2014;which entails many great dangers not realised by the people, of this realm. Before entering upon my subject, I would impress upon your Lordships that nothing can be further from my intention than to make any attack upon the Government, still less upon any particular member of it. With the late Secretary of State, for War, the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, I was brought into almost daily contact whilst I was Commander-in-Chief, and I believe he will corroborate the statement that we worked most cordially together. No disagreeable incident of any sort that I can recall ever marred the pleasant relations which marked our intercourse. This is all the more satisfactory because, no matter what may be our military system, the non-political Commander-in-Chief and the political War Minister must often approach Army matters from very different standpoints. Even when equally impressed with the importance of a certain step they may disagree as to its feasibility. For example, say that it seems highly desirable to provide better field guns and more of them. It is the soldier's manifest duty to press for them strenuously, yet the War Minister, better informed as to the current financial demands of the Empire, may hesitate, to approve of the expenditure. He may
<image src="S4V0090P0I0282"/>
<col>329</col>
honestly believe that some other national requirements should have precedence. Even if he has been convinced personally of the urgency of the measure, he has still to bring his colleagues and the Cabinet to the same way of thinking, while there always remains the fierce Cerberus that guards the Treasury and so often refuses to be appeased.<lb/>
It would not be difficult to show that the needs of the Army and its general efficiency have been more than once subordinated to the wish to produce a low Budget. Here, obviously, points of difference may arise between the political chief and the professional soldier. But it is not my intention to dwell upon the past. My concern is with the present and the future. I have no personal complaints to urge, no grievances to ventilate. My one great object is to strengthen the position of my successors in the post I have lately vacated, so that they may be given a larger share in the management of the Army than the existing Order in Council accords to the so-called, but really misnamed, Commander-in-Chief. No one can recognise more fully than I do the complete and individual responsibility to Parliament of the Secretary of State for War for everything relating to the Army. This constitutional responsibility was clearly defined in the War Office Act of 1870, and subsequently strengthened by Orders in Council. I do not, cannot, complain of it, for it existed long before the present Army system was invented, and it is inevitable under our Constitution<lb/>
My complaint is against the present Army system, which has robbed the professional Commander-in-Chief of his chief usefulness, and has virtually handed over the command and entire management of the Army to a civilian Secretary of State assisted by subordinates with whom he deals direct. If anyone doubts this fact let him read the Order in Council of November, 1895. Let me give an illustration of how that Order in Council works and of the position of the Secretary of State under it. When. Mr. Kruger declared war against Her late Majesty in the year 1899, it was found necessary to send a large army to South Africa. But if that army had not been forthcoming, the fault would have rested with the Secretary of State for War, not with
<col>330</col>
the Commander-in-Chief. If the guns or small arms with which our troops took the field were not what they should have been, or, to come down to the present moment, suppose it were necessary now to mobilise our Militia, Yeomanry, and Volunteers for home defence, and it was found that the only guns in their possession were practically useless for modern warfare, the responsibility for that state of things would not rest with the Commander-in-Chief. The Secretary of State for War would be alone responsible for it. He is also responsible to Parliament that all reserves are ready, the guns, ammunition, clothing, horses, saddlery, harness, and everything else necessary to convert an army on a peace footing into an army fit for the field. Of course, under our Constitution this, the ultimate responsibility, he can share with the Commander-in-Chief or any other military officer. But he may be greatly relieved in it, the burden may be lessened, by the help of his expert adviser.<lb/>
It has always been, and is still, the duty of the Commander-in-Chief to bring strongly&#x2014;he cannot do so too strongly&#x2014;to the notice of the Secretary of State the wants of the military forces. If he feels the Regular Army is not strong enough to perform the duties for which it is maintained, or if its material, its armament, and equipment are imperfect or insufficient, it is his duty to urge the need for additions&#x2014;it has often been mine, as Adjutant General and Commander-in-Chief, to do so&#x2014;but after that he can do no more. There the Commander - in - Chief's responsibility ceases. Although the various needs are not disputed, not only are no steps taken to meet them, but no one outside the Government is aware that their urgency has been raised. The Government has thought it advisable from economic reasons to postpone their provision, but yet it will not take the nation into its confidence that such important demands for men and stores have been put forward by the experts, and, nevertheless, refused. I cannot assert too emphatically that it behoves Parliament to devise some plan by which the fact that these strong representations have been so made and still refused should be laid before the nation for it to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0283"/>
<col>331</col>
decide between the expert and the economist. In no other way can we safeguard the Empire from great and unknown perils.<lb/>
For the last twenty-eight years I have been employed in various positions under many War Office administrations, and many an evening at the end of my day's work I have felt sick at heart when I contemplated the great national risks deliberately accepted by the Government that happened to be in office. And why so accepted? Because it was not then politically expedient to ask Parliament for the money required to properly arm and equip our Army. Ministers evidently hoped that evil days might not befall the country during their term of office. It has often fallen to my lot when in the field to have to calculate the chances and the risks that certain operations would entail, and I have had at times to face, those risks and run them in making a choice of possible evils. But I would ask, What are such risks to those deliberately accepted time after time by Cabinets sooner than do the unpopular thing of asking for money to provide against them? When war is upon us, then money is to be had easily and for the asking. But money, as we know to our cost, will not then purchase in the open market soft he world the guns and other stores which were not laid in betimes, and which, when war comes, are consequently required. It is but natural in time of peace, under our system of government by party, and when the nation is left in ignorance of the views entertained by the military specialist upon the military requirements of the moment, that the party in power should still put economy before efficiency, and strain every nerve to spend as little as possible. That is the necessary out come of the political system upon which our Constitution is framed.<lb/>
My Lords, in asking you to seriously consider the present unmilitary system under which the Army is now administered, I believe I can express some useful opinion upon this subject. At any rate, I feel that, as a Member of your Lordships' House, it is my duty, as well as my pleasure, to state here the result of my experience. Before I enter into details, I feel that I must ask the House
<col>332</col>
to allow me to give a short outline of the Army system it replaced. I shall not go into ancient history, and shall be as brief as I can. What I may call the modern system of Army Government was begun by the greatest War Minister have we had in modern days&#x2014;Mr. Cardwcll&#x2014; with the War Office Act of 1870 and the Orders in Council of that same year, which defined the respective duties of the Commander-in-Chief, of the Surveyor General of Ordnance, and of the Financial Secretary. The Commander-in-Chief retained under that system, as, theretofore, the direct and real command of the Army, and was charged with the discipline, distribution, military education, training, and the fighting efficiency of all ranks in all the military forces of the Crown. The Surveyor General of Ordnance was "charged with providing, holding, and issuing to all branches of those forces food, fuel, clothing, arms, and all the stores and equipment and transport they required, both in peace and war." The duties of the Financial Secretary were to draw up the Annual Estimates and to watch over all military expenditure.<lb/>
This system remained in force until 1888, when Mr. Stanhope, then War Minister, amended and strengthened it by the Orders in Council of that date. They brought our Army abreast with modern ideas as far as that was possible under our form of government. The changes they introduced may be fairly regarded as the mathematical complement to Mr. Cardwell's great measure of Army reform of some fifteen years before. In my opinion Mr. Stanhope's system was a sound and workmanlike solution of a very difficult problem. The Army never gave him the credit he deserved for it, nor for the courage and determination with which he combated the opposition it encountered. Under it, the responsibility of the War Minister to Parliament was in no sense reduced, but subject to it; the Commander-in-Chief&#x2014;the military specialist&#x2014;was charged with the discipline, education, military training, and fighting efficiency of all ranks of the military forces that are annually voted by Parliament. In other words, the Commander-in-Chief was held responsible by the Secretary of State for War that
<image src="S4V0090P0I0284"/>
<col>333</col>
those military forces were always thoroughly efficient, and, supposing the stores, guns, etc., voted were sufficient, that the Army was always ready for rapid mobilisation. This, I contend, was a practical, well-working system&#x2014; very different from that in force to-day. An effective control over all military expenditure was exercised by the Financial Secretary, who was a Member of Parliament and directly under the orders of the Secretary of State for War. The Commander-in-Chief had no command over public money whatever, and it was the duty of the Financial Secretary to keep the War Minister informed upon all matters bearing in any way upon Army expenditure. Whilst, therefore, the financial control of the Minister was absolute and complete, the military efficiency of the Army was secured by being placed under one man, the soldier-expert, the Commander-in-Chief. He was, in effect, as I have said, directly responsible to the War Minister for the discipline, military education, training, and fighting efficiency of all ranks. I believe it went far to reconcile the anomaly of dual government under which our Army has always laboured, and while it ensured the complete control of Parliament over the Army, did not interfere with the direct responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief for military efficiency.<lb/>
The next modification of the system was started when Mr. Stanhope's Order in Council of February, 1888, was barely two weeks old. The new move was originated by a Member of the other House&#x2014;an old friend of mine and an old soldier&#x2014; who asked for a Royal Commission on the military and naval requirements for the protection of the Empire. This was a very sensible proposal, and it might well be revived to-day, when the nation is sadly in need of enlightenment on this essential question. The answer accorded was amusing, and it may be said that the hon. Member, having asked for bread, was given a stone. A Royal Commission was granted, not to investigate the necessities for national defence, but to report "on the extent to which our naval and military systems as at present organised
<col>334</col>
and administered are adapted to the national wants. "There was yet a greater change of front when the Commission was appointed and the reference to it made public. Its object was stated to be&#x2014;
<quote>"to enquire into the civil and professional administration of the naval and military departments and the relation of those departments to each other and to the Treasury, and to report what changes in the existing system would tend to efficiency and economy in the public service."</quote>
This Commission consisted of the noble Duke the Lord President of the Council and of eight others. Of these, one was a soldier, one a sailor, one was a Member of your Lordships' House, four were Members of the other House, of whom one had been Chancellor of the Exchequer and three had been Secretaries of State for War, one had been Governor of Bombay and possessed great Indian experience, the eighth being a private gentleman of commercial experience. Had this Commission confined itself to a Report on the subjects set forth in the instructions given to it, I have no doubt that, composed as it was, its Report might have been of high public value. But it launched out into recommendations for a complete change at he system of Army command and Army administration. I feel that nine-tenths of the Army would not believe that efficiency could result from changes carried out merely upon the recommendation of a Commission in which only one member was a soldier&#x2014;a brilliantly able man, indeed, an old comrade of whom I have the highest opinion, but who had never held any high command, and had never been Adjutant or Quartermaster General of the Army. This Committee submitted two Reports, and of the eight members five dissented from clauses in both Reports. One member, a late Chancellor of the Exchequer, recommended the abolition of the office of Secretary of State for War. And yet upon the strength of those Reports an Army system then known to have been working admirably was overturned and the present experimental system established in its place. I call it experimental because no such system had been tried that I know of in any other army before. I
<image src="S4V0090P0I0285"/>

have been told that the new proposals were based upon a system under which the Navy is administered by a Board. Not being a sailor, I am incapable of expressing any useful opinion upon the system upon which our Navy is managed. I emphatically pronounce it to be entirely unsuited when applied to the government of the Army, and I maintain that under it you will never have an efficient, and I doubt much if you will ever have a contented Army.<lb/>
In 1895, the illustrious Duke, who bad been a most popular Commander-in-Chief for nearly forty years, resigned that position, and I was selected to succeed him. The present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in intimating to me that I had been selected to succeed his Royal Highness, informed me that it was intended to introduce regulations which would greatly alter the position of all future Commanders-in-Chief, and it was upon that understanding I accepted the offer. When I subsequently learnt what was the nature of these alterations, I found they were certainly not to my liking, but I resolved to give them a, fair trial. I have done so honestly for the last five years, including a full year of actual war. It is because, after this experience, I believe them to be injurious to the efficiency of the Army and fraught with danger to the highest interests of the Empire, and because I am certain that under their provisions you can never have any effective Army, that I am here to-day in the hope of making my reasons for this opinion evident and clear to your Lordships.<lb/>
Allow me now to analyse briefly this experimental Army system of 1895. It follows generally, as I have said already, the plan under which the Navy has long been administered&#x2014;namely, by a Board. In other words, it divides into what I may term water-tight compartments the responsibility, under the Secretary of State for War, for the fighting efficiency of the Army, a responsibility which in all previous times had been concentrated in the Commander-in-Chief. The heads of these four water-tight compartments have no connection one with the other. They have no general military head; each is singly and individually responsible to the Secretary of State for War for the orders he gives and the work he performs.<lb/>
<col>336</col>
Each is the adviser of the Secretary of State for War, and in describing their duties and position no reference even is made to the existence of a Commander-in-Chief. Until 1895 the Commander-in-Chief, as I have repeatedly urged, was responsible to the Secretary of State that the Army was thoroughly well trained for war. There is now no one soldier to whom the country can look as directly and professionally responsible for the military efficiency of the Army it pays for. It must depend upon the statesman, almost invariably a civilian, whom the Prime Minister may select from among political supporters for the position of Secretary of State for War. I would ask, Is this wise? Is it businesslike?<lb/>
I venture to illustrate this method of Army administration by a homely and familiar analogy. I have lately been engaged in converting an old farmhouse into a little country residence. My first step was to call in an architect, an expert. I told him what I wanted, and, having done so, I left the expert to look after the builder and his men. Under our Constitution the Secretary of State, as the representative of the Cabinet, used to stand to the Commander-in-Chief in much the same position as I did to the architect. The Secretary of State acted as the owner, the Commander-in-Chief was the expert. But mark the difference of procedure: instead of dealing with one expert, the Secretary of State asks the opinion and advice of every one of his foremen, without the knowledge of the architect, much less consulting him. Had I followed this system, I wonder what sort of a house I should have had&#x2014;very possibly the staircase would have been forgotten. One of the foremen&#x2014;let us say the carpenter foreman&#x2014;in his anxiety to make perfect his own particular job in which his interest was absorbed, and knowing little or nothing of the general plan of the whole building, might have impressed me with the importance of his own special share in the operation, while the drains might have been over looked, or some other necessity might have been omitted that would have left the house uninhabitable. Amplifying this, and dealing with it on broader lines, the inconvenience, the mischief, the possible dangers of the present system may be exemplified in another way. Hardly one of the many
<image src="S4V0090P0I0286"/>
<col>337</col>
questions that come up before the Secretary of State for decision is of quite a simple nature. All, as a rule, concern several distinct branches in the War Office. Take, for instance, the introduction of a new rifle. Here there are intricate, technical points affecting all manners of people. The mechanism, range, and precision of fire are within the province of the Director General of Ordnance; the weight of the weapon, the carrying power of the soldier, the facility for aiming and firing, involve important questions which concern the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster General, and so on. Each of these officers would naturally give the best advice from iris own particular branch's point of view, which would often be at variance with the views urged by other departments. How can the political Minister of War, to whom military science is more or less an enigma, usefully hold the balance between such conflicting opinions? How can he be sure that ho is giving due weight to each point, and that he fully realises the force of one and the weakness of another? That can only be well done by the trained military expert, the Commander-in-Chief, who knows from experience every technicality, every detail himself. It is the business to which he has been brought up, and he can therefore easily sift out the rubbish and emphasise the good stuff in a way that only an expert can. Then, when he has heard all sides, he will form his opinion, and with the sound judgment of ripe knowledge and wide experience he will lay the case before his official superior, the Minister for War. There can be nothing of this kind under our present military system. The civilian Secretary of State is left in a fog of doubt and indecision, the result of which is the probable shelving of the question, or, still worse, that the wrong course is taken.<lb/>
If the Coinmander-in-Chiei is not allowed to command the Army in the sense that he is the one man whom the Secretary of State is to consult, and whose professional advice he is to follow, he will be like the invalid who took the advice of half-a-dozen doctors, each separately and without the knowledge of the others. In his case there will be as many conflicting and inconsistent plans of operation as there were foremen
<col>338</col>
under the arehitect in my building illustration. It would seem, indeed, that to save appearances the title of Commander-in-Chief is still bestowed upon a General Officer, but lie is not allowed to have or exercise the authority possessed by every Commander-in-Chief before 1895, and, strange to say, which is still exercised by the Generals commanding in Ireland, in India, and in all our foreign stations. The Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General are no longer the stall' officers of the Commander-in-Chief at Army Headquarters, as the officers bearing those titles are of the General Officers under whom they serve elsewhere, and as the Adjutant and Quartermaster of a regiment are the staff officers of its commanding officer. They are now accountable to the Secretary of State for War, and not to the Commander-in-Chief, for the discharge of their duties. They are, in fact, the staff officers of the civilian Secretary of State, who deals with them directly, independently of the Commander-in-Chief, and even without his knowledge, on all the most important subjects in which military efficiency consists.<lb/>
Is this a military system that commends itself to any man who knows the A B C of military organisation, of military life, of military history? Only think of what would be the result if you introduced such a system into the management of an infantry battalion&#x0021; Suppose a clever magistrate in each town where a regiment is stationed were selected by the Home Secretary to have under him the adjutant and the quartermaster, who were to be responsible to the magistrate for the discipline, housing, feeding, and general well-being of their regiment, and that the magistrate was at the same time to ignore the existence of the regimental commanding officer? Is that a condition of things that recommends itself to your Lordships? Does any man imagine it would conduce to military efficiency? But I may be told that the Commander-in-Chief is by the Order in Council of 1895 "charged with the general supervision of the military departments of the War Office." Yet the head of each of these is himself "responsible for all questions relating to his department, and for submitting
<image src="S4V0090P0I0287"/>
<col>339</col>
them&#x2014;when higher authority is necessary&#x2014;to the Secretary of State." The incompatibility of these provisions is surely obvious. Mow can the Commander-in-Chief supervise or control a department the head of which is an independent authority, at least to the extent of having free access to the supreme head? My Lords, I should not like to weary you with criticisms upon the distribution of responsibility laid down in the "memorandum showing the duties of the various departments of the War Office and the responsibilities of its principal heads to the Secretary of State." Suffice it to say that it is a contradiction in terms, and the system it creates is unworkable&#x2014;is, indeed, in my opinion, an impossibility. The endeavour to combine general control in one place and person with individual responsibility in many others has failed in both objects. The Commander-in-Chief has not effective control; neither are the heads of departments fully responsible. Moreover, the work and cross reference in all branches has largely increased without any benefit to the Army or the public service.<lb/>
As an illustration of this I may mention that all letters for the purely military offices, even those upon discipline, drill, and technical and purely professional points, are now addressed to the Under Secretary of State, and not to the military branches that can alone deal with them. They are all answered, not in the name of the Commander-in-Chief, but in that of the Secretary of State. When the colonel commanding a regiment receives a letter in the name of the Secretary of State, upon, say, the advantages of open formations in field movements, the order is received as a comical episode of our new military system. To many it is a joke, but this novel system of correspondence is misunderstood in the Army generally. It leads soldiers to believe that even serious matters of discipline are no longer dealt with by their officers, but by a civilian Secretary of State, of whose very name they are mostly ignorant. My Lords, I presume I need scareely tell you that our soldiers do not love the War Office or its civilian rulers. You cannot thus flout the sentiment of the Army without doing injury to its morale. No soldiers like the idea of being commanded
<col>340</col>
by men in civil life, and no one who knows what our soldiers are like would ever have invented a system which brings that fact home to our men. At present the centralisation of work and correspondence in the office of the Secretary of State is excessive, and the work is not nearly as well done as when it was distributed throughout the military branches. In fact, the Army becomes less and less ruled and governed on military lines, to the detriment of military efficiency.<lb/>
In a, time of pressure, such as that we have lately gone through, valuable time is squandered. The Commander-in-Chief's action is often paralysed, and the office blocked with routine papers passing backwards and forwards to and from the office of the Secretary of State, most of which should be disposed of by suberdinate officers in the purely military branches. But I am told that our Navy, the first in the world, is ruled by a Beard in which there are only four sailors: that each of these four has distinct responsibilities, for the due performance of which each is alone answerable to the First Lord&#x2014;a civilian who is necessarily as ignorant of ships and sailors as I am. I am not competent to express any useful opinion upon any naval matters, nor to criticise the mode in which our splendid Navy is governed: nor do I know whether the majority of our admirals and captains are fully satisfied with our system of naval government I am not a sailor, and, consequently, my opinion upon such a point would be absolutely worthless. I confine myself to expressing an opinion upon the govern ment of the service&#x2014;the Army in which I have spent my life and in which I have held the highest positions, both in peace and in war. I am fully aware of the responsibility I assume when I state that my experience convinces me that as long as you continue to deprive the Commander-in-Chief of all responsibility for the discipline, military education, military training and fighting efficiency of the officers and men who constitute the military forces of the Crown, you must not expect to have the effective army which the' nation wants, and for which it is prepared to pay.<lb/>
We have thus created for Army Head quarters a military system which I have
<image src="S4V0090P0I0288"/>
<col>341</col>
shown to be new to our own Army, opposed to all the experience of the past, and different also from the system under which our own armies in Ireland, in India, and at all stations at home and abroad are commanded and governed. You refuse to give to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army the command and discipline of the troops under him, although you do confer those responsibilities upon all local and suberdinate commanders. Does the nation mean to perpetuate a system as illogical as it is novel and unmilitary and unsatisfactory? If the Army must have a War Minister responsible to Parliament&#x2014;and this constitutional principle cannot be departed from&#x2014;ought we not. As far as possible, to prevent this principle from being destructive of our Army? No matter how able the civilian War Minister may be, I may without offence say that he must necessarily be ignorant of war and its science and still more of its practice. Who would care to know his individual opinion upon any military subject? Is he likely to be the best man to create an army or to convert a badly-trained army into a good one? We are proud to be called a nation of shopkeepers, but is this a businesslike proceeding? In the interests of the Army, but still more of the State, we are beund to work upon some intelligible plan for the management of England's military business which will harmonise with established principles. I say, with confidence, that the only one which will answer the national ends was that devised in 1888 by Mr. Stanhope. Under it the Army steadily improved year by year until 1895, when the present pernicious system was introduced, and on no sufficient reason so far as I can see.<lb/>
I should much like, before I conclude, to return to one branch of the subject which I touched on incidentally at the beginning of my speech. I am strongly of opinion that the military expert at the War Office should have the privilege, that it should be his right, no less than his duty, to make his views public whenever the occasion arises. My Lords, it is not a satisfactory state of things that when there is a difference of opinion on our military needs between the political and the professional chief, nothing is heard on the point of issue outside the War Office. The matter may have
<col>342</col>
seemed to the soldier one of extreme urgency, fraught with momentous bearing upon our life, our very existence as a nation. The civilian, rightly or wrongly, thinks otherwise, and there it ends. Now I say, I affirm, most unhesitatingly, that it should not be competent for the War Minister, or indeed the Cabinet, to give a final decision adverse to a proposal deemed of such grave importance by the military expert. In such a situation, in such a conflict of opinion, only the nation itself can decide. We should take the people of Great Britain into our confidence, and after stating beth sides of the case, ask them for a verdict. The Commander-in-Chief would show cause why more men, more guns, more material, some change of military policy were in his opinion imperatively needed. The War Minister would reply defending his action in refusing to comply with such demands. Either side might be justified; the need might not be so great as suggested, the difficulty of response at the moment insurmountable; but at least those most concerned, the people themselves, would have the casting vote. I have always thought that Governments show much weakness in concealing the fact that such momentous questions hang occasionally in the balance.<lb/>
I would go yet further in assuring the nation that its interests were being constantly safeguarded in the matter of its military institutions and strength. I would throw the weight and responsibility for these upon the Commander-in-Chief, not only by revising the Order in Council of 1895, but by calling for a definite and direct report or certificate from him, year by year, that the Army was in proper order, fit and complete at every point, sufficient in numbers, well found in every respect, armed with the best weapons, sufficiently equipped and ready for rapid mobilization. Where deficiencies and shortcomings existed they should be stated specifically and in detail. My experience of Army Headquarters in many capacities, and extending over many years, leads me to believe that had this rule been in force, had the demands made annually for the last fifteen years by the Commander-in-Chief been published, together with his reasons for making them, the taxpayer would, in most, if not all instances, have
<image src="S4V0090P0I0289"/>
<col>343</col>
insisted upon these demands being complied with whenever they had been refused. This would have added perhaps to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget, but the country would have escaped many terrible risks. It is not the fault of any particular Secretary of State that we are never ready for any great emergency, but because the nation is never told how we stand in such matters, and the only practical remedy is to be found in this annual report from the Commander-in-Chief to which I have just referred. Without it I would warn this House and the people of England that they can never be certain they are getting the value of their money already-spent, or that they will not be rushed at a time of crisis into almost unlimited expenditure. There are many good reasons, into which I shall not enter here, why our standing army should be small. All I claim is that, at whatever level you may fix the strength of our fighting forces, they should at all times be thoroughly efficient, and that a report to this effect should be supplied by the Commander-in-Chief. His responsibility for this statement must so obviously affect his character-and reputation that a very sound guarantee for its honest is afforded.<lb/>
Recapitulating briefly. I repeat that I found the system established in 1888 under which I worked all that could be desired under our constitutional conditions. I have lately given the new system, that of 1895, a fair trial of five years, and I condemn it as an arrangement that will never give us a satisfactory Army. I believe it to be a fruitful cause of military weakness, and that it is likely to become a positive danger in times of war. One other word. It may be reasonably argued that if our present Army system is so bad. So unlike that of all the great military nations, how were we able under it to despatch the large army to South Africa we so lately sent there in such a satisfactory manner? The answer, my Lords, is a simple one. No Army system, however bad it may be. Would be allowed to stand in the way at such a time by officers like those of whom the Headquarters Staff of the Army consisted in 1899. I have known the War Office well for the last twenty-eight years, and I unhesitatingly say
<col>344</col>
That as a whole it could not have been composed of better men than those serving when Mr. Kruger declared war. All were highly educated in their profession, almost all having qualified at the Staff College. They were effectively helped by all the generals and their staff at the several ports where troops embarked. All worked hard, day and night, and all were determined that the Army required in South Africa should be despatehed from England without a hitch, system or no system, and they successfully carried out that determination. But in doing so they were not helped by the new Army system. If ever the history of what was then done is fully written, the country will realise how much it owes to those officers, and how little to the new-fangled, experimental, and unmilitary system under which they were supposed to work. According to my views of national and military matters, it is an unwarrantable risk to run in war to rest content with an inherently bad Army system, trusting always to find first-rate officers to work it in time of need.<lb/>
An army system to be sound must be constructed upon essentially military principles of the simplest and least complicated nature, so that it may work almost automatically. It must be worked upon military lines, by officers well educated by staff, work, under the direct orders and supervision of the most experienced general as a commander-in-chief. He must know what war is. And, abeve all things, must thoroughly understand British soldiers, their needs, their virtues&#x2014;and they are many&#x2014; their likes and dislikes. He should be a man who can sympathise with their prejudices, and who from personal experience knows well the history and traditions of His Majesty's Army. Our Army is a peculiarly complicated contrivance, differing from all other European armies in constitution, duties, and character, and my own long experience tells me it can never be what the British nation expects it to be under our present military system. As I have already said, no one is more convinced than I am that the responsibility of the Minister for War to Parliament cannot be reduced in any way. But, my Lords, it was most carefully safeguarded by the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0290"/>
<col>345</col>
provisions in Mr. Stanhope's Order in Council, whilst the Commander-in-Chief was made directly and professionally responsible to the Secretary for War for the discipline and efficiency of all our military forces. That is the chain of responsibility upon which alone, in a constitutionally governed country like ours, the efficiency of the Army and its readiness for war can be adequately secured. Without that link between the civilian statesman, who is the Parliamentary ruler of the Army, and the professional soldier, who is Commander-in-Chief, the nation can have no sound guarantee that the Army they pay for is always efficient, and always ready in every respect for that conversion from a peaceful to a war footing which we describe as "mobilization."
In what I have said I have endeavoured to avoid all reference to individuals, or to particular instances that would illustrate my meaning. I hope my reasons for doing so may not be misinterpreted, but I feel beund to say that the records of the War Office will be found to fully bear out all I have asserted. I end as I began, by imploring the House to seriously consider the essentially unbusinesslike system under which the military forces of the Crown are now administered.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01268"><member>*THE SECRETARY Of STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (The Marquess of Lansdowne)</member><membercontribution>: I wish, in the first place, to notice a gentle remonstrance which the noble Duke on the back benches addressed to me at the opening of his speech. He made it a subject of complaint that in the year 1895, when I had presented a somewhat concise description of the operation of the Order in Council of that year, I held out hopes of following it up with a fuller statement, and that I had disappointed that expectation. I am quite unconscious of having given that pledge, but if I did, and if it remained unfulfilled, it was perfectly open to the noble Duke to remind me of it in any of the years which have since elapsed, and to ask me to make it good. But the suggestion that we are unduly secretive in these matters is, I think, disposed of by the Parliamentary Paper which contains not only the Order in Council of 1895, but a full account of the duties of the
<col>346</col>
various departments of the War Office, and the rules of procedure under which its work is done. If the noble Duke will study that Paper, he will find that it deals with many of the points which he has raised.<lb/>
I pass to the statement to which we have just listened from the cross benches. Although we may not all of us entirely agree with what fell from the noble and gallant Viscount, I am sure that we are all of us glad to feel that the self-imposed muzzle which he has worn for the last five years no longer prevents him from taking part in our debates, to which his great experience and authority cannot fail to contribute weight and information. I wish to confirm the statement that fell from him with regard to the nature of our personal relations during the five years in which we were employed together at the War Office. I do not know whether the Chamber which intervened between that of the noble and gallant Viscount and my own was the scene of such a fast and furious traffic as now appears to pass through it; but we constantly met. And I can honestly say that, so far as I am aware, no important question of Army administration was ever dealt with by me without reference to the noble and gallant Viscount. To-night he has touched upon the difficult and delicate question of the relations of the Commander-in-Chief and the seeretatary of state and of the relations of beth those high officials to the heads great departments of the great departments of the War Office. The subject is one abeut which much has been said and written. It is a subject full of difficulty and perplexity; but I think that those who have listened to the speeches of the noble Duke and the noble and gallant Viscount must have felt that the real issue involved tonight is a comparatively plain and simple one.<lb/>
The issue raised is this: Are we once again to entralise in the Commander-in-Chief of the Army the whole of the responsibility for all the enormous and various work which is conducted in the War Office? Are we going to deprive the great experts of the War Office of the responsibility which now adheres to them for the advice which they give to the Secretary of State? Are we going to deny to the Secretary of State
<image src="S4V0090P0I0291"/>
<col>347</col>
the right to obtain expert advice at first hand from these high officials? That really is the broad and simple issue which has been raised. The answer to these questions must be in the negative, I am perfectly willing to admit that the system introduced in 1895 may be regarded as to some extent experimental, and that the experience of five years, culminating in the experience of a great war, may lead us to the conclusion that certain changes in that system are necessary. It may be that we shall do well to give back to the Commander-in-Chief certain powers which were withheld from him in 1895. It may be, on the other hand, that we shall do well to take away from his immediate control certain portions of office work which are now immediately under him. But those are, comparatively, matters of detail, and I will not attempt to anticipate the statement which, will, no doubt, before long be made elsewhere by the Secretary of State for War. But on the main principle of enabling the Secretary of State to obtain the advice of his experts at first hand&#x2014; upon the main principle, I for one am not willing to listen to any proposals involving the reversal of the present system and a return to the old system of 1888.<lb/>
My Lords, the noble and gallant Viscount went somewhat minutely into the history of the various changes which have been made in the organisation of the War Office. I am not going at this hour to follow him, but I wish to impress this on your Lordships, that the system of 1888, to which he wishes to revert, is not in any sense consecrated by long usage or justified by experience. It was a system introduced in 1888, in which year the office of Surveyor General of Ordnance, which was held by a civilian, a Member of the House of Commons, was done a way with and the three high officials, dealing with works, ordnance, and the supply of the Army, were placed under the immediate control of the Commander-in-Chief. The result of that change was to effect a stupendous centralisation of responsibility in the person of the Commander-in-Chief. You had at the head of this immense system His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, who for so long presided over the
<col>348</col>
Army, T and who certainly was not, regarded, even by those who most valued his great abilities, as in any sense an expert upon all the subjects with which the War Office has to deal. Under the Commander-in-Chief and abeve the great heads of departments there came the Adjutant General, again an officer who was not necessarily an expert, so that the advice of those who were really experts&#x2014;experts as to works, experts as to fortifications, and as to supplies&#x2014;had to percolate to the Secretary of State, first through the Adjutant General and then through the Commander-in-Chief. What was the result? The Secretary of State could not get expert advice upon all these questions from the Commander-in-Chief, and the true experts had no right to give such advice. Of course he got it occasionally, but be got it <i>sub rosa</i>. There were informal consultations between the Secretary of State and the heads of departments. Surely if there are to be consultations of that kind, is it not clear, is it not far better, that they should be abevebeard?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01269"><member>VISCOUNT WOLSELEY</member><membercontribution>: Under the system of 1888, and even prior to that, so far as I know, the Secretary of State had the power, which he very often exercised, of sending for any military officer and asking for his advice on any topic that he wished to inquire abeut.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01270"><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: Exactly: but when the military officer gave that advice he gave it without responsibility. The responsible adviser was not the expert for whom the Secretary of State; the sole responsible adviser was the Commander-in-Chief. That is the great difference between the two systems. My Lords, the system of 1888 was almost universally condemned. It was condemned in the press and it was condemned in Parliament, and the disfavour with, which it was met led to the appointment of the Hartington Commission. The noble and gallant Viscount was severe en the composition of the Hartington Commission. We know how difficult it is to find suitable gentlemen to take part in these inquiries. I have noticed lately that whenever an inquiry is called for, what is most desired by the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0292"/>
<col>349</col>
public is that we should get away from professional people and go to what are described as men of business&#x2014;men of common sense. Now, my Lords, if ever there was a Royal Commission on which common sense might be said to abeund it was, I should think, the Hartington Commission. I will not, in the presence of the noble Duke, suggest that he is conspicuous for that quality; but he was at the head of the Commission, and he was aided by Mr. W. H. Smith, pre-eminently a man of business, and a man looked up to by all who knew him for the soundness and vigour of his judgment: by Lord Randolph Churchill, a man of extraordinary brilliancy and originality; by Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman, formerly Financial Secretary to the War Office, and subsequently Secretary of State for War; by Sir Richard Temple, an Indian administrator of well-known experience; by Admiral Richards, who was able to bring to the Commission a thorough knowledge of the affairs of the Admiralty&#x2014;a Department which is so often held up to us for admiration; and, finally, by Mr. Ismay, a well-known shipbuilder. It is true there was only one soldier upon it, but the Commission took military evidence by the acre, and it was the Report of that Commission which led to the Order in Council of 1895. I will quote a few lines from the Report of the Commission. The Commissioners say&#x2014;
<quote>"We consider that a definite and direct responsibility to the Secretary of State should be pieced on the heads of departments for then-several administration, as is the case with the Naval Lords at the Admiralty. Under the present system the only real responsibility appeals to rest on the Commander-in-Chief, who alone would be accountable to the Secretary of State, even for such a matter as the defective design of a heavy gun. We do not find that this centralization of responsibility exists in the administration of the armies of any of the Great Powers of Europe, and we consider that it cannot conduce to efficiency. The professional officers administering departments in the War Office should, therefore, be made directly responsible to the Secretary of State for the efficiency of those departments and for the economical expenditure of the sums annually allotted to them."</quote>
It became our duty to deal with that Report. When we came into office we found that our predecessors had made considerable progress in framing a scheme founded upon it, and I do
<col>350</col>
not think that when the Order in Council was introduced there was any great difference of opinion between the two parties in Parliament with regard to the course to be adopted. We gave to each of the heads of departments that responsibility which the Hartington Commission desired to impose upon them, and to the Commander-in-Chief we gave the supreme command of the Army, the right of general supervision, and we gave him, at the same time, extremely important duties of his own to perform. My experience of the system docs not agree with the experience of the noble Viscount. I believe, on the contrary, that the system has worked well during the last five or six years, and I believe if there were, as there no doubt have been, failures and mistakes during the South African War, they were not due to the system of 1895, but due, if anything, to the fact that that system was not carried out as faithfully as it might have been.<lb/>
The noble Viscount suggested to us that we were able to keep a force of over 200,000 men in the field not on account of any merits in the system, but because of the devotion of the Headquarters Staff of the Army in those trying times. I gladly join my witness as to the devotion with which our colleagues; but does the noble Viscount forget that every important step and decision affecting the army in the field in South Africa was considered by the Army Beard which was introduced as part of the machinery of the scheme of 1895, an Army Beard of which he himself, under our rules of procedure, was the president, and which, therefore, gave him an opportunity at every step of keeping his finger on the pulse of what was being done and seeing that it was done properly, and that the departments did not act in ignorance one of the other? That part of the indictment of the noble Viscount has signally failed, because I think we may claim that if anything was well done&#x2014;and some things were not badly done&#x2014;it was done under the system introduced in 1895. The description which ho gave of the position assigned to him under the Order in Council was, if he will permit me to say so, a travesty of the actual facts. He repeated more than once that under the Order in Council
<image src="S4V0090P0I0293"/>
<col>351</col>
the command of the Army had passed away from him to the civilian Secretary of State for War. My Lords, I am constrained to say that that is a mere rhetorical phrase. None of the attributes of the Secretary of State for War can be properly described as involving any-thing like command. Under the Order in Council the command of the Army is in so many words conferred upon the Commander-in-Chief: all Army Orders are issued by him. He is the principal adviser of the Secretary of State for War. He is charged with the distribution of the Army at home and abroad, with the preparation and maintenance of plans for the mobilisation of the Regular and Auxiliary Forces, with the preparation of schemes of offensive and defensive operations; he is charged with the appointment to commissions, promotions, honours, and rewards; and the Military Secretary, who is his immediate suberdinate&#x2014;not supervised by him, but under his control&#x2014;deals with the admission of candidates for the Army and that great and important question of the education of the Army which the noble and gallant Viscount suggested had been taken away from his cognisance.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01272"><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>:I suggest that the duties thus assigned to the Commander-in-Chief, far from being inadequate and insufficient, are duties so vast and important that one is rather inclined to the belief that he would find them of a positively overwhelming character. I have, indeed, heard it suggested that too much work and not too little was thrown by the Order in Council upon the Commander-in-Chief. Yet the noble and gallant Viscount suggested that we had succeeded in practically abelishing the office of Commander-in-Chief. My noble friend the Under Secretary for War made use of an expression which summed up aptly this part of the case. He told your Lordships that the supervision exercised by the Commander-in-Chief, which the noble and gallant Viscount so much derided, was "exactly what the Commander-in
<col>352</col>
Chief chooses to make it." My complaint of the noble and gallant Viscount is that he chose to make his supervision a great: deal smaller than it really was, and that he has persisted in and acted upon that most erroneous belief. He may have wished to give the system a fair trial, but I am compelled to say that he did not<lb/>
I think if he had been a little more ready to take advantage of the great opportunities placed within his reach he would not have made those complaints. My Lords, what are those opportunities. The Commander-in-Chief is a member of the War Office Council, at which important questions are discussed in the Secretary of State's presence, lie is president of the Army Beard, at which other important questions are discussed. It is laid down in the rules of business that all important Papers are to be laid before him, and he has an absolute right, of his own motion, to call for any Paper he pleases or to initiate any proposal he may think desirable. The noble and gallant Viscount did occasionally initiate proposals having reference to all the different departments of the War Office. But our complaint of him was that he did so fitfully, and only when the spirit moved him. If he had watched his opportunities more carefully, things might have been somewhat different. If he had paid more attention to the duties assigned to him by the Order in Council, he might, for example, have enabled us to turn to better account that large number of auxiliary forces that we have in this country, and which I am constrained to say have been not a little neglected during the last five years. I think that if he had paid more attention to that part of the regulations which requires him to prepare schemes of offensive and defensive operations he would, perhaps, have told us, before the South African War, that Ladysmith was not a very suitable military station for Her Majesty's forces to occupy. He might even, if he had paid rather more attention to these questions, have warned us that it would take more than one army corps to subjugate the two South African Republics.<lb/>
My Lords, I say it with regret, hut I say it with a strong conviction that I am only saying what is true, that the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0294"/>
<col>353</col>
noble and gallant Viscount failed to take into account the immense importance of the special duties assigned to him by the Order in Council, and assigned to him not in common with other officers of the War Department, but as duties for which he alone was responsible to the Government. I know he was under a misapprehension, because, on the very eve of my departure from the War Office, I had an opportunity of considering a paper written by the noble Viscount on the subject which he has brought before us to-night, and I found, to my intense surprise, that in the enumeration of his duties contained in that paper he omitted altogether to mention that he was responsible for the mobilisation of the Army, that the Intelligence Department was under his special control, and that he was charged with the preparation of schemes of offence and defence.</membercontribution></p>

<col>354</col>
will call it his complaint of the system introduced in 1895, and the gravamen of his charge is that under that system the heads of departments are constituted the responsible advisers of the Secretary for War. I think that is accurate. That I hold to be absolutely essential. The Secretary for War has to defend in Parliament proposals involving the expenditure of millions of public money for such things as the supply of the Army, equipment, and artillery, barracks, and other works; and it is absolutely necessary, to my mind, that he should be fortified by the advice of experts, given not through two or three other members of the Headquarters Staff, but given to him directly, and with a full sense that the giver of the advice is responsible for that which he advises. The noble and gallant Viscount made a I great deal of the argument that the present system involved over centralisation in the person of the Secretary for War. I think his suggestion was that that was an infinitely more dangerous | kind of centralisation than the old centralisation in the person of the Commander-in-Chief. Let us consider that argument for a moment. There is all the difference in the world between the two kinds of centralisation. Centralisation in the Secretary for War is in a sense inevitable, because he and no one else is responsible to Parliament for the affairs of the Army. You must therefore have a certain amount of convergence of responsibility in him. But there is another aspect of the question. Centralisation under the Commander-in-Chief means centralisation in one who is a soldier and an expert. Centralisation under the Secretary of State means centralisation in one who is not a soldier, and has no pretension to be an expert. Consider the difference I in the position, let us say, of the Director General of Ordnance when he comes, in as the case may be, to the Secretary of State. He finds an official who is not his military superior and who has no pretension to expert knowledge. If he comes to the Commander-in-Chief he has to do with a member of his own profession, who is senior to him, and from; whom, with that strong feeling of discipline which is prevalent among soldiers, he may be extremely reluctant to differ.
<image src="S4V0090P0I0295"/>
<col>355</col>
Who is likely of the two to get at the I real opinion of the expert adviser, the Commander-in-Chief or the Secretary of State? I venture to think the expert is far more likely to give his advice fully and freely to the civilian than he is to his military superior.<lb/>
Something has been said by the noble and gallant Viscount as to the practice of the War Office with regard to correspondence. I think the Under Secretary for War dealt sufficiently with that point. he was perfectly correct in saying that in 1899 I had proposed that letters going out from the War Office should be written in the name of the heads of the different departments of the office. I was met by strong military objections, and I abandoned the proposal, with the result that the present system was introduced, and although the noble and gallant Viscount suggests that the present procedure leads to letters on purely military questions being addressed to distinguished officers by the civilian Secretary of State, he will remember that, although the letter is written by the instructions of the Secretary of State, the formula used (if my memory server me right) is that he intimates to the recipient of the letter that the view or the decision of the Commander-in-Chief is so and so. There is no attempt to suppress the authority of the Commander-in-Chief, and in all purely military cases it is his authority and not that of the civilian official that is always invoked.<lb/>
With regard to letters addressed to the War Office. If an officer in a district were expected to address his letters, not, as now, to the Under Secretary for War, but to the particular department which had to deal with the subject of the letter, I am afraid that there would be perpetual confusion, because, as the noble and gallant Viscount himself told us, in such cases you are very often concerned with perhaps two or three departments, and the person who writes the letter may have considerable difficulty in deciding as to the manner in which it should be addressed. I remember that was brought very strongly before me when the question was discussed. But these are comparatively small matters. In regard to such matters I, for one, am entirely in favour of doing all that is possible to meet military
<col>356</col>
sentiment, and if any improvement in the procedure can be devised I shall join with the noble and gallant Viscount in welcoming it very heartily.<lb/>
In another part of the statement of the noble Viscount he told the House that he thought it was extremely necessary in the interests of public safety that when the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of State for War were unable to agree the public should be taken into our confidence, and that we should leave the public, as it were, to choose between the two. I am afraid that that is somewhat a council of perfection. Does the noble and gallant Viscount think that the government of this country would be possible, that the administration of the War Office would be practicable, if, whenever the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief were not at one, their arguments were to be publicly paraded and to form the subject of controversies in the press or on the platform I cannot conceive a more fatal arrangement than that there should be disputes of this kind in the eve of the public. The noble and gallant Viscount is a great supporter of a very popular institution called the Military Tournament. I should be very sorry if the Secretary of State were obliged to take part in a military tournament of the kind which the noble and gallant Viscount suggests.<lb/>
Of course, it is the case, and it always will be the ease, that there will be differences between the civilian officials at the War Office and the military officials. It will be so to the end of time. I do not think that the noble and gallant Viscount has very much to complain of in regard to the manner in which his military demands were dealt with while I had the honour of serving with him. The Estimates, at any rate, rose during his five years from &#x00A3;18,000,000 to &#x00A3;21,500,000 sterling: and at his invitation we added to the strength of the British Army no less than 25,000 soldiers. Of course the noble and gallant Viscount did not always get what lie wanted, and I do not think I am wrong in saying that he certainly did not always expect to get what he wanted. At any rate, I know that when he and I used to take stock after the preparation of the annual Budget, he always accepted gratefully
<image src="S4V0090P0I0296"/>
<col>357</col>
and philosophically the substantial additions which I was able to procure for him, and that he never suggested to mo that any of our failures to concede his demands in full involved results fatal to the efficiency of the British Army. I will not, at this hour of the night, attempt to follow the noble and gallant Viscount through the other points upon which he touched in his long statement; but I will merely say that in my opinion he is too apt to forget the limitations which our Parliamentary institutions place upon us, that ho has failed correctly to apprehend the bearing of the system introduced in 1895, and that because he failed to apprehend it he did not turn to account the great opportunities which that system placed within his reach. In my opinion the system, of 1895 was in principle a perfectly sound system, and I sincerely trust that, whatever may be done hereafter, we shall not revert to the discredited and, as I believe, disastrous system which prevailed between the year 1888 and the year 1895.<lb/>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01419"><member>MR. BRODRICK</member><membercontribution>: My hon. and gallant friend is fond of propounding questions in a debateable manner.

At the same time, may I ask the Financial Secretary to the War Office whether the remainder of Sergeant-Major Garner's estate has been issued, as stated by the Financial Secretary; and, if so, has the non-effective account also been received, and on what date was the remainder of the estate issued; and, considering that eighteen months have elapsed since Sergeant-Major Garner's death, in justice to his widow, can inquiries be made by telegraph at the battery which is in standing camp at Natal.</membercontribution></p>

His non-effective account has not been received owing to the fact of his battery, which was engaged at Dundee, being unable to furnish the details. Enquiry has been made by telegram and every endeavour is being made to clear up the matter. The balance of money due to the Sergeant Major, with his war and discharge gratuities, has been provisionally issued, and although it is against all regulations I have authorised the payment of half the amount shown to be in the savings bank according to our last return.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01428"><member>LORD STANLEY</member><membercontribution>: The attention of the Secretary of State has been drawn to this matter. The preference for cotton over linen khaki is due not only to the fact that the latter is more expensive, but also colder and less absorbent than the former. In view of the recent adoption of woollen drab serge for the service dress of the Army, it is very improbable that any large quantity of either cotton or linen khaki will be required hereafter by the War Department.</membercontribution></p>

officials, and there also is a rope. All the employees of the Water Trust have a key to this sluice-house, as also the constable of the district. Although the constable had been in the neighbourhood of the dam on the two previous days, he was unfortunately not there on the day of the accident, having been detailed for special duty at a funeral at Wemyss Bay. As a heavy thaw had set in, he thought no one could possibly venture on the ice, and therefore did not apply for a constable to take his place. It would, as the hon. Member can understand, be impossible for the police to watch all the many reservoirs and dams within their jurisdiction and be responsible for warning persons against their own foolhardiness&#x2014;a duty which is not imposed on them by any Statute. But the chief constable proposes to communicate with the engineer of the Water Trust of Greenock, to the effect that if he will at any time notify to the county police that in his opinion there is danger of accidents to venturesome people at the reservoirs within their jurisdiction, a police constable will be detailed to warn them of their danger.</membercontribution></p>

<title>DAIRY INSTRUCTION IN MUNSTER.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01483"><member>MR. FLYNN <memberconstituency>(Cork County, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been directed to the proceedings at the last meeting of the Minister Dairy and Agricultural Institute at Cork on the 26th ultimo; and, in view of the fact that the governors of that institute communicated with the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction some months ago asking for a definite decision as to the establishment of an agricultural school in connection with that institute and the continuation of the system of itinerant dairy instructresses for the province of Munster, whether he can state what is the cause of the delay in sending a definite reply to the governors of the institute; and, seeing that the Cork County Council voted a grant of &#x00A3;1,000 a year in February 1900 in aid of the establishment of an agricultural school, can he say what steps the Department is going to take in this matter, and how soon?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01484"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member has been good enough to send me a newspaper report of the meeting referred to in the question. I am advised that the governors of the Munster Institute have been fully informed of the views of the Department of Agriculture, which were to the effect that the Department
<image src="S4V0090P0I0311"/>
<col>387</col>
would recommend no change in the position of the Munster Institute until all the county councils of the province had had time to consider the question adequately, pending which consideration the work of the institute would continue as heretofore. It is true the county council of Cork passed a vote of &#x00A3;1,000 for the purposes of the Munster Dairy School, but the schemes of the Cork County Council under the Agriculture and Technical Instruction Act are as yet in a very immature state, and the other county councils of Minister are equally interested in the question involved. It would be most undesirable for the Department, by precipitate action, to take any steps which might adversely influence the character of agricultural education in the country generally.</membercontribution></p>

Local Government Board and Local Government (Ireland) Officials standing on to-day's Paper.
<quote>&#x2020;The following are the Returns referred to in the question&#x2014;Wexford County <i>v</i>. Local Government Board.&#x2014;Return giving the Report of the Judgment delivered in the Irish Court of Appeal on Monday, 25th February last, together with the Pleadings and Affidavits on both sides, in the ease of the County Wexford County Council against the Local Government Board for Ireland.</quote>
<quote>Local Government (Ireland) Officials&#x2014;Return giving the cases in which the Salaries of County Council, District Council, Urban Council, and Union Officials have been increased or attempted to be increased by the Local Government Board for Ireland since the pissing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, together with the amount of the former Salary and of the increased Salary in each case, and the total addition to Irish Local Taxation consequent upon these increases; and giving also Copies of the protests of the local bodies concerned against these increases or attempted increases.</quote></membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01488"><member>MR. PATRICK O'BRIEN</member><membercontribution>: At the same time may I ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether his attention has been directed to the comments of the Judges of the Court of Appeal in Ireland on the letter of the 30th April, 1 900, addressed by the Irish Local Government Board to the County Council of Wexford; and whether he will lay upon the Table of the House the letter referred to and the affidavits of Sir Henry Robinson, Vice-President of the Local Government Board, in reply to the case made by the Wexford Council against the sealed orders of the Board which have been quashed by the Court of Appeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01489"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: In respect of the first of these Returns there is no objection to giving the report of the judgment of the Court of Appeal, with the affidavits attached. I do not quite gather what is meant by the pleadings. It would be impossible to give, officially, reports of speeches made by counsel. There is no objection to giving the information asked for in the second Return, excepting only the protests of local bodies. There are, in all probability, protests upon minutes which have not been communicated to the Local Government Board in the form of resolutions. I should be unwilling, by publishing those received, to expose the Board to the charge of having withheld any protests. On the other hand the task of obtaining access to, and of searching all the records of all the bodies concerned over so long a period, would involve a greater labour than I feel could fairly be thrown on a heavily worked Department. The form of this Return is now under consideration in connection with a somewhat similar notice recently moved for by the hon. Member for North Donegal, and I will communicate with the hon. Baronet on the subject in the course of a couple of days.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01550"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: The difference of practice is the result of a difference in the law in the two cases. I am not prepared to propose any change in the Irish Act in this respect.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01551"><member>Mr. FIELD</member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury whether, seeing that when the Irish Valuation Commissioner issues his valuation it becomes law subject to appeal, he can state whether the new valuation of the county boroughs of Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick, and Waterford will increase local and Imperial taxation; and whether, in view of the Financial Relations Report, care will be taken that the valuation shall be lowered, in order that the Imperial taxation of those county boroughs may be reduced, as the local rates can be met by increased poundage.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PROCEDURE OF THE HOUSE-AMENDMENT<lb/> OF STANDING ORDERS.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01588">Standing Order No. 51 read.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01589"><member>Mr. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: I rise to move the motion which has now been for some days on the Notice Paper of the House. The effect of the amendment of our Standing Order would be to place the House in relation to Committees of Ways and Means precisely in the position in which it ordinarily stands with regard to Committee of Supply. As the House is aware, it was formerly possible for private Members to move resolutions whenever one of the Orders of the day was to the effect that "Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair for the purpose of going into Supply." That practice has led to certain evils which it is not necessary for me to deal with now, and it was found to be intolerable. But up to last year no similar inconvenience has been felt with regard to the power of moving Amendments on going into Committee of Ways and Means. That power has always been open to private Members, but it has seldom been taken advantage of; and, before last year, I think I am not wrong in saying that there were only live cases in the last twenty yea is in which any lion. Member thought it necessary to take advantage of this privilege. With the exception of t he occasions when the Consolidated Fund Bill or the Appropriation Bill were before the House, I do not think tint for the past twenty years hon. Members have ever thought it necessary to interpose by putting down a motion upon going into Committee of Ways and Means. But it is evident that
<image src="S4V0090P0I0320"/>
<col>405</col>
a practice once started will continue. There are, I think, two motions down already on going into Committee of Ways and Means, and it is perfectly certain that the way having been once shown by some bold pioneer, like my hon. friend behind me, he would find plenty of imitators, and the House would no longer be sure, when the Order for Committee of Ways and Means is put down, that it might not be occupied by some quite different and possibly totally irrelevant discussion upon some other matter. It is very instructive to bear in mind what happened in a parallel case on going into Committee of Supply. It was a superstition very prevalent when I first came into the House, and it has not yet been wholly dissipated, that the power of moving resolutions on going into Committee of Supply is a modern relic of the old privilege possessed by the House of Commons of dealing with grievances before granting Supplies. I understand that very careful investigation was made into this question some years ago, and it was then discovered that the first time a resolution had been moved on going into Committee of Supply was in the year 1811, by a gentleman who seems to be the predecessor of my hon. friend in Parliamentary inventiveness, and who first saw the opening that this Standing Order left to private Members. But although that privilege was started in 1811, it was only used three times in the course of the succeeding ten years. But the practice grew, and it grew apace, until the time came when the House felt that it was impossible to deal with Supply if, whenever the business of Supply was put down, some totally different question was raised and discussed for an indefinite time. I suppose that there are Gentlemen on both sides of the House who regard this as one of a long series of tyrannical interferences with the rights of private Members, and who think the proposed amendment of our Standing Order, like all previous amendments, is really due to the inordinate greed and ambition of successive Governments, who wish to grasp unduly the time at the disposal of Parliament to carry out their own nefarious or,
<col>406</col>
at all events, undesirable schemes. I think that is an extremely shallow view to take of a process which I quite admit has been going on now for a century.<lb/>
The real truth of the matter is that a great many causes have been at work which make it perfectly impossible for the Government to do any work at all, or to carry on the business of the country, without modifying the rules of the House. It is not the fault of the Government, or the fault of the House, but it is due to circumstances over which the House has really no control, for it is due to the increased perplexity of modern Governmental work, to the press and the telegraph; and due, perhaps, to one other cause as much as any other, and that is the fact that a very much larger number of hon. Gentlemen desire to take part in our debates than was the case one hundred, or eighty, or even sixty years ago. I am not one of those who believe that the level of Parliamentary ability in this House has in the smallest degree fallen; I rather take the other view. But assuming that what I say is true and that Parliamentary ability in this House is very much higher than it was, it is not surprising that the great mass of Members are now, being forced by their constituents, far less content than they were to allow the work of discussion in this House to be carried on by a relatively small number of selected and favoured individuals. While that process has been going on unfortunately the day still consists of only twenty-four hours, and only a certain number of Parliamentary days occur in six months, and sessions which last more than six months are rightly considered as inflicting too great pressure upon hon. Members of this House. Therefore, if you are going to treat your business in a common-sense way, and see that during this six months there shall be a fair amount of time given to those who desire to criticise matters, and a fair amount of time to those who want to discuss the Bills of the Government, and also a fair amount of time to the Government in order to carry out the work of legislation which the country requires, it is absolutely necessary that you should, from time to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0321"/>
<col>407</col>
time, so modify your rules that that fair division of time shall not be interfered with on one side or the other It may be&#x2014;and my lion, friend thinks that it is a fact&#x2014;that under our existing system the time allotted to Members of the Opposition and to private Members of this House for the purpose of Parliamentary criticism is inadequate. I think that forty-three days out of one hundred days, roughly calculated, which are given up to the work of criticism, is more than sufficient. That, however, in my judgment, is a matter for entirely separate discussion from the motion which I have placed before the House, and if the time allotted is insufficient, by all means let us increase it. We might increase the twenty-three days given to Supply to twenty-five days, or make any other change which is thought desirable, but do not let us re-introduce with regard to Committee of Ways and Means a system which has been productive of nothing but confusion and evil in connection with Committee of Supply. If hon. Gentlemen will look back at the debates which took place in this House when the privileges of private Members were gradually being curtailed in the matter of resolutions going into Committee of Supply, they will find that the evil most universally complained of, not merely by the Government, but by independent Members themselves, was that this system of moving resolutions produced the utmost uncertainty as to the period at which important business would come on. If that is true&#x2014;and it certainly is true&#x2014;of the resolutions moved on going into Committee of Supply, still more is it true of resolutions on going into Committee of Ways and Means. I may remind the House that almost the most important occasion on which this House goes into Committee of Ways and Means is when the Chancellor of the Exchequer has to explain to the House and to the public his financial scheme for the year&#x2014;which is an occasion of the profoundest interest both inside and outside of these walls, an occasion always looked forward to by every class of the community interested in it, and it would be of the utmost inconvenience should it be postponed at the wall of one single individual, which it
<col>408</col>
might be, because on going into Committee of Ways and Means there is not even that limited safeguard which we now claim for a motion for the adjournment of the House. A motion for the adjournment of the House cannot be moved unless, at all events, forty Members agree to it. But a single Member, acting in concert with nobody else and representing nobody else, has it in his power to put down a subject I for discussion on the motion "That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair" on going into Committee of Ways and Means, which may last nearly the whole night, and which may throw the Budget speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer into the dinner hour, and may cause in other ways the utmost confusion in our business, and inflict the utmost inconvenience both upon the House and the public. In a lesser degree the same objection applies to any other occasion in which the House is asked to go into Committee of Ways and Means. Those other occasions are really confined to the occasion on which the House goes into Committee of Ways and Means for setting up the Consolidated Fund Bill, by which we terminate our financial year, and again when the House goes into Committee of Ways and Means upon the Appropriation Bill, which winds up the financial business of the session. It is competent under our existing rules for an hon. Member to put down what motion he likes upon these occasions. But observe the great inconvenience of even this. At the present time the Consolidated, Fund Bill is the last work we do&#x2014;or almost the last work we do&#x2014;before the Easter rising, and if you allow private Members to bring in these motions upon the introduction of the Appropriation Bill then you will have to finish off the business of Supply a day earlier than at the present time. It is hard enough at present to get our Supply through so as to enable the Government to comply with the law, but that difficulty will necessarily be increased if you add one more day to the time given up to Supply by allowing hon. Members to put down a motion on going into Committee of Ways and Means when we introduce the Consolidated Fund Bill. A parallel argument applies to the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0322"/>
<col>409</col>
Appropriation Bill at the end of the session. We fix our holidays to run at the time when the Appropriation Bill passes its Third Reading, and we have to arrange to get through the work of Supply before the Bill is introduced. But unless this Amendment is accepted a notice may be interposed on going into Committee of Ways and Means, which would render our financial machinery, already cumbrous in certain parts, still more cumbrous.<lb/>
There is another argument to put before the House in support of this motion. It is directed against the peculiar privilege which allows the House to discuss any subject which any lion. Gentleman chooses to bring forward on the motion to go into Committee of Ways and Means. But there are two occasions given, on the Consolidated Bill and the Appropriation Bill, ready to hand, within two or three days of the Ways and Means motion, upon which hon. Members have this opportunity. As everybody is aware, it is open to any hon. Gentleman on the Second and Third Readings of the Consolidated Fund Bill and the Appropriation Bill to raise questions&#x2014;I will not say on any subject whatever, but any question which is relevant to any Estimate; and to add to these two occasions another occasion within three days appears to me to be adding to the difficulty and confusion of our Parliamentary proceedings, which is wholly uncalled for. I hope the House will see, therefore, that we are not interfering by this rule with the practice of the House, but are only seeking to perpetuate the practice of the House, the practice of going into Committee of Ways and Means without motion interposed, and a practice only interfered with five times during the past twenty sessions. In these circumstances I venture to say that a full case has been made out for assimilating our Standing Order relating to Ways and Means to the Standing Order which has worked with such excellent results in regard to Committee of Supply.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman in this motion is carrying rather too far the inroads and encroachments that have been made recently upon the privileges of independent Members. The right hon. Gentleman has himself, by his own action through several years, done a great deal to cure an evil which existed in the experience of many of us, in the irregular manner in which proceedings on going into Committee of Supply were conducted, and in preventing the proper business of the House, which the House was entitled to expect to come on, from being interfered with at the caprice of an individual Member. But I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman in putting these few opportunities on going into Committee of Ways and Means at all on the same footing as Committee of Supply. After all, as the right hon. Gentleman has stated with perfect accuracy, there are in ordinary sessions only three occasions on which this opportunity occurs&#x2014; the Consolidated Fund Bill, at the end of the financial year; the introduction of the Budget, and the Appropriation Bill at the end of the session. Well, I think on the face of it there could not be a more legitimate occasion for bringing forward various questions, if it were necessary to bring them forward, than on either of these occasions. The right hon. Gentleman said that the Appropriation Bill and the Consolidated Fund Bill afforded large opportunities for discussing general questions; but I am under the impression that in going into Committee on the Consolidated Fund Bill, the discussions must be confined to matters involved in the Supplementary Estimates, and which are dealt with in the Consolidated Fund Bill; but in any case I do not think that even these opportunities are at all too much to be afforded to Members of the House for bringing forward numerous miscellaneous questions, if they choose to raise them, which they may be prevented from raising when bound by the strict rules governing debate in Supply.<lb/>

the number of days for Supply; but, after all, these discussions are confined to the particular Votes brought forward in Supply. What is wanted is that there should be these more general opportunities of raising questions which would otherwise not come immediately into the view of the House. I quite admit that this is a rule which, in practice, might be employed in an embarrassing way not only to the Government, but to the House itself. For example, a motion might be made which would have the effect of delaying the introduction of the Budget resolutions, and the prospect of such inconvenience last year led to a special arrangement being made to avoid it. In the case of the Budget resolutions I quite recognise that it may be necessary to guard against such intervention, but that can be done by a special motion made for the occasion. The Government have this weapon at their hand if they wish, and could thus avoid the great inconvenience to public business as well as to themselves; and if they adopted that method it seems to me they would not be driven to make such an inroad upon the rights of private Members. We can carry the curtailment of the rights of private Members too far. I am not one who has ever been a champion of those rights above my neighbours; I rather lean to the other view of the question. At the same time, the private Member is like Nature: you may turn him out with a fork, but he will always come back. If he does not get a legitimate way of airing his eloquence and giving his views to the House, he will find another. If you shut all the doors the result will be a multiplication of motions for the adjournment of the House, which are most inconvenient to everyone, and which are all the more objectionable be-because they are entirely inconclusive, and which, therefore, we ought not to encourage. Here are these little escape holes, these little vents for the soul of such Members as my hon. friend the Member for King's Lynn. Seeing that the privilege has not been abused hitherto, and seeing that the Government have it in their power, by special resolution on particular occasions when public inconvenience might arise, to protect themselves and the
<col>412</col>
House against an abuse of the privilege, I do not sec any necessity for the further restriction proposed by the motion of the right hon. Gentleman,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01593"><member>*MR. GIBSON BOWLES <memberconstituency>(Lynn Regis)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: My right hon. friend the First Lord of the Treasury has been pleased to talk of me as having introduced something novel in the practice of this House. But it is he that is the innovator, he is the revolutionary it is he that has carried the flaming torch and not myself. What does his motion really mean? He said that his object was to put the House in the same position in going into Committee of Ways and Means as in going into Committee of Supply; and at the end of his speech he said that his object was to assimilate the practice on these two occasions. But this motion will not do that at all. This motion is to leave out the words "or of Ways and Means." If the House will permit me, let me read the Standing Order&#x2014;
<quote>"That whenever an Order of the Day is read for the House to resolve itself into Committee (not being a Committee to consider a Message from the Crown, or the Committee of Supply, or of Ways and Means, or the Committee on the East India Revenue Accounts), Mr. Speaker shall leave the Chair without putting any question, and the House shall thereupon resolve itself into such Committee unless Notice of an Instruction thereto has been given, when such Instruction shall be first disposed of."</quote>
The House will see the effect of that Order. The Speaker leaves the chair without question put, except in the case of going into Committee of Ways and Means. Committee of Supply is dealt with by another Standing Order, No. 50, and that provides that there also Mr. Speaker shall leave the chair without question put, "unless on first going into Supply on the Army, Navy, or Civil Service Estimates respectively," when an Amendment may be moved relating to the Estimates proposed to be taken in Supply. My right hon. friend does not recognise that his motion would not leave us in the same position as regards Ways and Means as we are in as regards Supply. If he were going to give us something instead of what he proposes to take away; if he were going to give us something in Ways and Means corresponding to what
<image src="S4V0090P0I0324"/>
<col>413</col>
we already have in we might consider the motion gives us nothing in return for the opportunities for discussion which now exist. And then the right hon. Gentleman characterises our objection to that as "revolutionary"&#x0021; [Mr. Balfour dissented.] Well, the right hon. Gentleman used the word "revolutionary" in reference to a motion which I made on a former occasion&#x2014;a motion I had a perfect right to make. It is a privilege which the house has exercised for centuries&#x2014;that, namely, of moving an Amendment to the motion that the Speaker leave the chair and the House takes go into Committee of Ways and Means. The right hon. Gentleman says that it is a superstition to presume that this right represents the old constitutional doctrine of discussion of grievances before Supply. But what does Sir Erskinc May say? In the 1879 edition of his work he says&#x2014;
<quote>"The ancient constitutional doctrine that the redress of grievances is to be considered before the granting of supplies is now represented by the practice of permitting every description of amendment to be moved on the question that the Speaker leave the chair before going into Committee of Supply or of Ways and Means."</quote>
What, therefore, my right hon. friend calls a superstition, Sir Erskine May calls the representative of an ancient constitutional doctrine. I need not remind the House of the restriction which the right hon. Gentleman has placed on the right of moving an Amendment to the motion for going into Committee of Supply; but no restriction has ever yet been asked for by any Minister, unless it be a Conservative Minster, on raising Amendments on the motion to go into Committee of Ways and Means.<lb/>
I cannot help thinking that his proposal rests upon a misconception of the functions and duties of the Government, and the duties and functions of this House. His Majesty's Government seem to consider that this House cannot be regarded as a creator, a destroyer, or a critic&#x2014; a creator of themselves, a destroyer of their opponents, and a critic of the Estimates. I think the right hon. Gentleman has too low and mean an opinion of the functions of this House. There are many Members not on the Government Front Bench capable not merely of creating a Government, of
<col>414</col>
destroying the Opposition, or of criticising the Estimates, but of suggesting great improvements in the administration of the country, and of initiating new departures in high politics. I remember Mr. Gladstone bearing the highest testimony to the success of the efforts of private Members in introducing improvements in some of the Departments in this House. It is possible that even the most humble private Member might have some suggestion to make which may not have struck the Olympian imagination of a Minister. It is conceivable that he might even suggest that mistakes had been made which might be recognised by the Government. Why, then, should the Government cut themselves off from all opportunities of profiting from, the intelligence of those private Members who come here not merely to criticise, but to suggest? New Members have come here full of such suggestions. There is not one of them but has come with some important motion or some important Bill in his pocket, and with the firm conviction that he would be able to bring it before a full House and have it thoroughly discussed. No doubt every Member has referred to the Standing Orders, which have informed him that out of the five Parliamentary days in the week three days, or six-tenths, of the Parliamentary time belong to private Members, and that only two days, or four-tenths, of the time belongs to the Government. Therefore he comes here filled with a desire to engage in public service, and a conviction that he will he able to do it; but he has scarcely arrived at the House when he discovers that the practice is altogether contrary to the Standing Orders, and that instead of the Government having only four-tenths of the time of Parliament and the private Members six-tenths, the Government take nine-tenths and leave only one-tenth to the private Members. Now, that is discouraging to the private Member; but that is not all. He is still more discouraged when he finds that the little time left to the private Member is disposed of not by any reasonable arrangement according to the importance of the subject&#x2014;and of course every private Member regards his as the most important subject in the universe&#x2014;but
<image src="S4V0090P0I0325"/>
<col>415</col>
by blind lot, And, by the way, how the Irish Members manage to secure such a large share of that luck I never could understand. The private Member, therefore, finds himself deprived of all opportunity of bringing before the House those great and important national subjects which have seized his imagination. There are five such opportunities nominally available to independent Members. One is an Amendment to the Address; but an Amendment to the Address means a vote of want of confidence in the Government, and a new Member, at least on this side of the House, has full confidence in the Government&#x2014;for he is a new Member. Then there is the opportunity, of putting questions; but questions lead to nothing. They are not always answered, or if they are answered the replies are not always explicable, and he sometimes finds that he cannot get answers to supplementary questions meant to elicit the meaning of the first answer. Then there is the Amendment on the motion for going into Committee of Supply; but that must relate to the Estimates to be taken in Supply. Moreover, the only thing the new Member can do there to assert his own importance to his constituents is to move the reduction of somebody's salary; but he does not care to do that&#x2014;he would rather increase the salary, hoping to get it himself some day. Finally, he may move the adjournment of the House; but he does not want the House to adjourn, he wants it to go on sitting until it comes to his subject. These are the five only opportunities on which an independent Member can raise a discussion, and they are altogether inadequate. But there is this sixth&#x2014;this ancient power of moving an Amendment to the motion that you, Mr. Speaker, do leave the chair, that the House may go into Committee of Ways and Means, a power which it is now sought to abolish.<lb/>
Now, this Amendment implies no want of confidence in the Government, and it affords an ideal opportunity to a new-Member for bringing forward subjects in which he is interested. I beg the Government to ask themselves whether this proposal does not show a certain want of foresight. The Conservative party will not always be on this side of the House. A Conservative Ministry
<col>416</col>
will not always sit on these benches, and when we cross to the other side and find proposals made by our opponents which we consider revolutionary, or perhaps fatal to the country, then, I think, Conservative Members will bitterly regret the reduction of the opportunities for bringing forward such matters before the legislature and the country. I hardly need adduce many authorities in support of the importance of this rule, but there is one which I would ask the permission of the House to quote, if I am not wearying it. A Committee sat on the procedure of the House in 1861. It was composed of most eminent men, its members comprising Mr. Disraeli, Lord Stanley, Sir John Pakington, Mr. Bright. Sir George Cornewall Lewis, and Lord Palmerston. Now that Committee reported as follows&#x2014;
<quote>"In strict conformity with the ancient usage of the House&#x2014;"</quote>
mark "ancient"&#x2014;
<quote>"a motion for going into Committee of Supply or of Ways and Means has offered a legitimate opportunity for full discussion on every variety of subject."</quote>
Having laid that down, the Committee proceeded to show the spirit in which the rules of the House should be dealt with, and I say that their words are absolutely admirable.<lb/>
<quote>"On all these occasions&#x2014;"</quote>
when the rules of the House are considered&#x2014;
<quote>"the House and its Committees have proceeded with the utmost caution. They have treated with respect the written and unwritten laws of Parliament which for ages have secured good legislation, perfect freedom of debate, and a due regard for the rights of minorities. This respect for tradition and this caution in making changes have proceeded on the principle that no change is desirable which experience has not proved to be necessary, and that the maintenance of the old rule is preferable to speculative amendment."</quote>
No experience has yet proved the necessity for this change, which abolishes, as I have said, an absolutely ideal opportunity for raising the most important of questions. It has been admitted that the power of moving such Amendments has only been used four or five times&#x2014; on two of them, I think, by myself&#x2014; during the last twenty years. That is proof itself that there has been no con-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0326"/>
<col>417</col>
siderable abuse of the right. If this remnant of power left to private Members was so necessary as the Committee said it was in 1861, how much more is it necessary now, when, time after time, something has been taken away from the opportunities of private Members of bringing matters before the House The Chancellor of the Exchequer went one better when he said that this power had not been used for forty years until it had been rediscovered by myself. I do not know whether it was rediscovered by me or not, but if it was, I think I ought to have had better treatment from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Instead of praising me for unearthing this forgotten arm of the Constitution, he denounced me for being the author of an abuse. I must say he showed an ingratitude almost appalling; for on each occasion upon which I have taken advantage of the rule, I have, solely for the convenience of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, cut short my speeches so as to deprive them, if not of all power, at any rate of all finish. If ho speaks to-night, I expect from him a handsome acknowledgment of this, and if ho does not give it to me, I shall be very much disappointed.<lb/>
Now, has there ever been any abuse of this rule If it has only been taken advantage of five times during the last forty years, and I have availed myself of two of these. What were the subjects brought before the House My first subject was the interception of the public taxes and their diversion from the public Exchequer. That was, I submit, a subject of first-rate, of the very highest importance, involving something like twenty millions a year being withdrawn from the purview of the House. The second occasion was one on which I introduced a very serious subject&#x2014;no less than the confessed insolvency of the Post Office Savings Bank. I could not have dealt with either of these subjects adequately upon any one of the other opportunities left to private Members. It cannot be denied that they were subjects of very considerable importance and quite worthy of some debate in this House. Moreover, as I pointed out at the time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to wait a very short time before bringing in his Budget. There is
<col>418</col>
no shred of ground for accusing me, nor so far as I know for accusing any one else, of an abuse of this right. If indeed, this motion had been used irregularly&#x2014;if instead of being used as a legitimate method of bringing on an important debate; if it had been used as an arm of coercion, and caused some Minister to make a doubtful and secret bargain behind the Chair, then it might have been called an abuse, and it might have been open to the animadversion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I have not abused the rule; I have only used it for a legitimate purpose; and if I propose to use it again it is with the object of calling attention to most serious treaty engagements for which this country is liable&#x2014;a subject which cannot be adequately discussed on any other opportunity. I had hoped that Ministers would have had some regard for the traditions, character, and efficacy of this House, even if these do come into competition with their convenience. I beg them to leave to the House some opportunities of showing that it is capable of useful discussion, and I do assure them that it will be safer for them to leave untouched the very few opportunities private Members still possess for earnest discussion of important subjects than to go on shutting down, one by one, the safety valves until there is an explosion. I do implore them to seek rather to limit their own convenience than to silence and suppress private Members. If they would only use a little more care and dexterity in handling the business of the House, Ministers will find that both the House and the Government would gain in every way. The Government are masters of big battalions, and may use them to crush out this last and most important right of the private Member, but if they do that&#x2014;and I say it with regret&#x2014;I will not be a party to it. If this motion is pressed, I must inevitably, as having striven to champion the right of private Members, vote against it. I regard the dignity and the efficacy of this House as far beyond the convenience of Ministers or the interests of party, and I believe that on the dignity and efficacy of this House depends to a very large extent the continued free-

<p id="S4V0090P0-01594"><member>MR. LOUGH <memberconstituency>(Islington. W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The right hon. Gentleman the First Lord of the Treasury made a statement at the beginning of the session that within the past forty or fifty years the power and dignity of the Crown had been an increasing and not a diminishing factor in the Constitution. I think the right hon. Gentleman might have stated that the rights and privileges of Members of this House had during that period greatly diminished, and certainly not increased. Independent Members are slowly being shorn of every privilege which they formerly enjoyed. I think everyone will feel sonic astonishment at the reasons given for the change proposed. I made a note of one or two of the points which were put to us by the right hon. Gentleman. The first statement he made was that this privilege had only been used five times in twenty years. Now, it seems to me that this is not a reason for taking away the privilege, but rather a reason for continuing it. The hon. Member for King's Lynn says that the Chancellor of the Exchequer puts the occasions on which this privilege was exercised as more rare than the First Lord of the Treasury said, but at any rate both of the right hon. Gentlemen agree that it has very seldom been used. The right hon. Gentleman the First Lord of the Treasury did not give us a single instance in which it was abused. Having been used on five occasions in twenty years, and no occasion whatever of abuse having been stated. I ask, Is it not a, strong measure to take to ask us to sign away this great privilege?<lb/>
I want you to look at this from another standpoint. The hon. Member for King's Lynn spoke as if only he had made use of this privilege in modern times. I remember a case in which Mr. Knox, who was until lately a Member of this House, moved a resolution with regard to the treatment of Ireland, and he only got the opportunity of making that most interesting motion by giving notice of an Instruction to the Committee of Ways and Means. Then what took place&#x2014;because this circumstance is very
<col>420</col>
relevant to our debate&#x2014;was that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his usual courtesy, met the hon. Member and said it would be inconvenient to put off the Budget, but if he would take another day an opportunity would be given him to bring forward his motion. The hon. Member readily agreed, and when he brought forward his motion this House discussed it for a whole day, having had ample notice about it. An hon. Member on the opposite side, who I am sorry to say is not with us now, Mr. Horace Plunkett, supported the motion, with the result that a revolution was brought about in the treatment of Ireland.<lb/>
I believe the right hon. Gentleman who has brought forward this motion to-day has shown a want of the sense of proportion in his treatment of the subject. We may have one thing done within twenty years in this House that will leave its mark in the history of this country, and if we accomplish one such thing as that by one of the Standing Orders or rules, I think Ministers should have what I will venture to call a reverent feeling for that portion of our procedure which enables the subject to be dealt with. But, as my hon. friend says, the Leader of the House complains that this right is a very inconvenient one. I would like to ask what he means by inconvenient. He only means inconvenient to himself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01595"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. I said it might inflict the utmost inconvenience both on the House and the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01596"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: I want to put it argumentatively. I think I can make a stronger point against the right hon. Gentleman if I say that he thinks it inconvenient to the Government.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01597"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: Not at all.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01598"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: Well, I put it from my standpoint. This right is inconvenient to him. It is a great convenience to me and to every private Member who wants to bring forward important subjects, and every Member ought to guard this right as one of the few he at present possesses. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say that it was pecu-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0328"/>
<col>421</col>
liarly useless; but it was not useless to Ireland on the occasion to which I referred. That was not a useless occasion of the exercise of privilege. How does ho prove that it is useless? Because he says we have the Consolidation and the Appropriation Bills brought before us, and in the discussion of these Bills we can do all that we could do with a special motion. I deny it. When notice is given of the motion, it has to be discussed in an orderly way, and hon. Members come down prepared to give attention to it. That is better than the irrelevant, heartbreaking discussion which we have on the Appropriation Bill. What takes place? You find one Member competing with another to be heard. One Member says to his friend, "You won't be long, as I have something to say," and it is impossible to take more than one division. I believe that if hon. Members would give their attention to the point, they would see that these opportunities do not in the least meet the great opportunity which is given us by this privilege which we have retained so long.<lb/>
There is one other point. The right hon. Gentleman said that the opportunities for criticism are sufficient. I agree that perhaps the opportunities for criticism are sufficient, and by all we make of our criticism, I think a little less would be quite as useful. A Minister stands up and gives a perfunctory reply or an amiable reply to the criticism. But that is not what we want. We want something done with the subject, and we want to have the opportunity of bringing forward something. I came here to-day to listen with attention to what could be slid with regard to the rule, and I have not found a scrap of a word to alter my opinion that this is an infringement of rights which Members on both sides of the House should resist. I am glad that the hon Gentleman opposite quoted the high authority of Sir Thomas Erskine May. This is really depriving us of the ancient right of bringing forward a grievance before Supply is granted. Generally speaking, we know something of the complaint before it is brought forward, and surely the right of putting down a motion before entering the Committee is one we ought to guard most
<col>422</col>
carefully. This is one of a series of infringements of our rights, particularly by the present Government, and for which the right hon. Gentleman is mainly responsible. The one-clause Bill is another method of infringing our rights. We have Bills introduced to which it is almost impossible to move an Amendment. Everyone who has watched the course of affairs in South Africa during the last four or five years, will admit that the Government have used all their influence to prevent criticism in this House. Have things gone well with us since Parliamentary criticism was suppressed by the Government? [An HON. MEMBER: Yes.] I do not think that things have gone well with us. We have felt the kindly appeals made to us by the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues not to prolong debate. We have had them going on steadily since the Jameson raid. It has been stated that negotiations are going on, that the Army is engaged in the field, that there was a Committee appointed, that the matter was <i>sub judice</i>, and that the matter must not be discussed here. On the most important national affairs for the last five or six years we have hardly had one free, full, and effective discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01599"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: On a point of order. May I ask whether the hon. Gentleman is in order in what he is now saying? It has nothing whatever to do with the Standing Order we are discussing.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01603"><member>MR. LOUGH</member><membercontribution>: I did not intend to go into detail as to the duties of the Committee of Ways and Means. It seems to me a most inappropriate time to restrict the right of Members who desire to put down Instructions when going into Committee of Ways and Means. I was going to give an illustration to show that, but your ruling makes it inexpedient for me to do so. I am quite sure that Members will see my point. At a time when the national expenditure is so much swollen, and when delicate questions are being dealt with as regards Great Britain and Ireland, it is most inopportune to suggest any restriction of our privileges.<lb/>
I cannot help thinking that the right hon. Gentleman is depending on his majority to get this restriction approved. I am very glad that some protests have already been made by Members on the other side. I would appeal to them to remember that they may not always be sitting behind the Government as they are to-day. They may some day change places with us, and I would ask whether they do not owe a greater allegiance than that of party in this matter. No doubt the Whips will try to make them support the Government, but I think a small advantage gained for the party in power, at the expense of the privileges of the House of Commons, is one which they will afterwards regret.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01604"><member>MR. ELLIOT <memberconstituency>(Durham)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I have heard the appeal the hon. Gentleman has made, that we on this side of the House should not listen to the voices of the Whips. I can only say that, having some little independence. I believe the interests of the country require us to make this small Amendment on the rule under discussion. There is an extraordinary fallacy underlying the arguments of the hon. Member for West Islington. He seems to think that a gigantic gulf lies between the business of the Government and that of the country. He seems to consider that Members are wanting in true loyalty to the House of Commons because they are anxious to advance the business of the Govern-
<col>424</col>
ment. It happens to be the case at the present time&#x2014;the beginning of a new session of a new Parliament&#x2014;that the most important business the House of Commons has to do is business which is in the hands of the Government. I support the motion of the light hon. Gentleman not so much on account of the rights of the Government as the rights and privileges of the House of Commons. There is no matter so important as that the House of Commons should reserve to itself full time to discuss the great questions brought before it; but the great questions likely to be brought before it are questions which will be introduced by the Government of the day. I would ask hon. Members, with all sincerity, on the other side of the House, whether the liberties of debate, whether the fulness of debate which we ought to have on all important questions, are not infinitely more in danger, not so much from the Government of the day as from the continual overpressing of the rights of debate by private Members. The real danger to the rights of the House of Commons is to be found in the excessive pressure of individual Members of individual rights, and the forgetting altogether of what is due to the House of Commons itself. I should be out of order if I gave some of the reasons which greatly limit our powers as a House of Commons, and greatly injure the repute in which we are held.<lb/>
I should like to say one or two words as to the length to which Members have pressed the right of putting questions, whereby an hour of valuable time at the best part of the day is taken away, not, I venture to say, in the interest of the public, and not in the interest of the House of Commons itself. That is one example of the way the House of Commons is injured in its repute. I must say that without any pressure from the Whips I shall go into the lobby without the slightest hesitation in support of the resolution before us. We must remember that the times are serious, and that the business we have to consider is that which it is the duty of the Government to treat as its own, and to defend fearlessly and boldly before the House.</membercontribution></p>

tion to the speech of the Leader of the House, but as far as I am concerned he failed to make out the least case for this alteration. One of his chief arguments was that this opportunity which he is now seeking to take away from private Members has been very seldom used. I have no doubt he has brought this motion forward because he fears that this session it will be very often availed of. Why does ho fear that? Because almost every opportunity hitherto available for private Members has been swept away. There is the motion to take away our Tuesdays before Easter. Does anybody suppose, if that motion is carried, we shall get those Tuesdays back? No; they will be gone for the session. In consequence of this ruthless seizure of their opportunities, the private Members are thrown hack upon the method aimed at by this resolution. I hope the motion will be defeated, and defeated by the help of the independent Members on the other side of the House. There are many, especially the Liberal Unionists, who come here pledged as independent supporters of the Government. I hope that they will not be content with cheering the excellent speech of the hon. Member for King's Lynn, but that they will by their votes let the Government see that this constant encroachment on the time of private Members is resented on both sides of the House.</membercontribution></p>

BARTLEY <memberconstituency>(Islington, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The remarks of my hon. friend the Member for Durham seem to suggest really that we had better wind up all discussion and all questions, and simply come here to register the decrees of the majority of the House for the time being. I must protest against any such view. I have always been a supporter of the rights of unofficial Members. I agree they must use their rights with discretion; but the question we are now discussing seems to be somewhat unfortunate. The Leader of the House stated that this right has been exercised so very rarely during the last twenty years that he now proposes to take it away in perpetuity.</membercontribution></p>

say. I said that before last year the opportunity had not been used more than five times in the twenty years, but that last year it was used, and this year it is being used, in my judgment, to the great inconvenience of the House and the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01608"><member>MR. BARTLEY</member><membercontribution>: That is very easily explained. The tendency to increase the use of this method is simply because the means by which unofficial Members can act are becoming every year fewer. What have we left now? After the Address is voted, the only way, practically speaking, in which any subject can be brought forward is by moving the adjournment of the House. That is a measure hostile to the Government, and one requiring the support of forty Members. It is a step very few Members care to take, except in a matter of extreme importance, and it is a movement almost entirely limited to the Opposition side. The real secret of the objection to this change is that the semi-official Member is becoming less and less a means of raising those questions for which ho is sent to this House. The question of importance is a matter really which the House itself must decide. I can conceive that this session there may be many questions arise which certainly would be very fairly brought up under this rule; but if this opportunity is taken away there will be no possible way for any of us to raise any question, except by moving the adjournment of the House. The whole reason of the present trouble is that Parliament ought to have met a little earlier. It is all very well to say that everything is left and that there is great pressure. The real thing is that the Government met so late, and now desire to make up for it by depriving unofficial Members of the small amount of time left at their disposal. It is rather hard upon us that we should be thus treated. The hon. Member for King's Lynn appears to be the chief offender in this matter in having ventured to take advantage of this rule. I very much regret if the rule has been improperly used, but I have not heard a single suggestion that any frivolous or unimportant matter has been brought forward. It is a pity, especially at the present time, when tins rule has not been abused, but has been
<image src="S4V0090P0I0331"/>
<col>427</col>
used, as all agree, only for the purpose of bringing forward very important matters, that the Government, which has such an enormous majority, should use its power to curtail our rights. I am afraid we are becoming a very despotic nation. We are ruled with a rod of iron. We give our allegiance to the Government, and are very glad to support it in every way we can, but it is somewhat hard that when it has unlimited power it should deprive unofficial Members of the one last remnant of the powers we used to enjoy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01609"><member>MR. GEORGE WHITELEY <memberconstituency>(Yorkshire, W.E., Pudsey)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The Leader of the House contended that this practice was an inconvenience to the House and the country. I venture to ask the right hon. Gentleman how and in what way it is so. Is it an inconvenience to the country to read in its morning papers dabates in this House upon matters that are of very great interest to it, and of very much greater interest than many of the propositions placed before the House by the Government? With regard to the House itself, wherein lies the inconvenience to private Members, who, after all is said and done, are the bulk of the House at present? I venture to say that if the right hon. Gentleman would take away the crack of the party whip, or if the division upon the point were by ballot, a very large majority of the party opposite would object to this alteration of the rule, and it would be defeated by a very large plurality. Five motions have been made under this rule during the last twenty years. Can the right hon. Gentleman conscientiously say that a right which has been practised only five times in twenty years has been an inconvenience to the House, the country, the Government, or anybody else? The hon. Member for Durham told us that the great questions of the day were introduced by the Government. I refer the hon. Member to the King's Speech, in order that he may see and judge for himself what are the great questions of the day.

<col>428</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01611"><member>MR. GEORGE WHITELEY</member><membercontribution>: I will simply ask, what opportunity has the House for dealing with the great questions of the day? Even in regard to Amendments to the Address, a Member who puts down a motion is frequently precluded from bringing it on, because, in the first place, Bills are introduced dealing with the subject, or, in the second place, the debate is closured at a very early period. So far as the private Member is concerned, he has now hardly any rights whatever. A time will come when the liberal party will be in a, majority in this House, and it will be in the interest of hon. Members opposite to bring forward motions dealing with various matters in order, I will not say to obstruct, but, at any rate, to cry a halt to legislation which they think injurious to the country. Hon. Members will then look back to this afternoon and regret that they made such a fundamental alteration in the regulations of the House. If this were made a temporary or sessional, instead of a permanent alteration, it would be better; at any rate, we should have some experience of its working before it was stereotyped. Could the motion not be moved in such a form as to give it a six months trial before the alteration becomes a fundamental part of the constitutional rules and regulations of the House which cannot be altered?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01612"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: On behalf of the Irish party, I desire to join in the protest against this new inroad a the rights of private Members. The First Lord of the Treasury made, absolutely no case for the proposed alteration. He unquestionably left the House under the impression that the effect of the alteration would be to place us in the same position as regards the motion for going into Committee of Ways and Means as we now stand in with regard to the motion for going into Committee of Supply. But, as the hon. Member for King's Lynn pointed out, the, proposed alteration places us in a much worse position. The only really substantial ground the right hon. Gentleman attempted to give against the right now enjoyed was, that it gave private Members the opportunity of throwing the Budget speech of the Chancellor of the Ex-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0332"/>
<col>429</col>
chequer into the background, and that it imported an element of uncertainty as to the night upon which the Budget would be introduced. To anybody who follows the proceedings of the House that objection is utterly absurd, because the motions complained of are made only after notice has been given, generally after notice of long standing. If such a notice appears on the Paper everybody knows that the first business will not be the Chancellor's statement. That, therefore, is a very frivolous ground on which to seek to justify a serious departure from the practice of the House as it has existed for three centuries. The Tight hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that these matters are matters of arrangement, and it would always be easy to arrange so that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not be called until half-past eight or nine o'clock.<lb/>
I object to this resolution as part and parcel of a system which has been enforced since this Government came into office with far greater stringency and disregard of the rights of the House than at any previous time during my recollection of the House. That system has been gradually and steadily to contract the area of the ri&#x2159;hts of private Members. It is all very fine for the right hon. Gentleman to spring up and indignantly deny that he had spoken of the convenience of Ministers or of the Government. Everybody knows the object of these successive invasions of the rights of private Members. There is really no other ground on which they are based than the convenience of Ministers and those who have the conduct of the business of the House. We are told that things are in such a condition now, that times are serious, and that the number of days before the end of the financial year is limited. Who is responsible for that? The condition of the country is the work of the Government. The limit of the time at our disposal is the work of the Government, because they, with a fuller knowledge than anybody else, could have of the business to be done, fixed the date of the meeting of Parliament. Therefore the only substantial justification put forward is the convenience of Ministers in carrying through Government business. The logical conclusion of that argument is
<col>430</col>
that private Members should have no rights whatever, that the House of Commons should be simply a voting machine, and that the proposals of the Government should be explained by Ministers and forthwith voted upon.<lb/>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the various opportunities still left to private Members to bring forward their views, especially pointing to the Second and Third Readings of the Appropriation Bill and the Consolidated Fund Bill. But he forgot to tell the House that, as I believe, for the first time in its history, he and the Ministry last session, in pursuance of this system, put in front of the Second Reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill three Government measures. That course of action was protested against by members of the party opposite, but their protest was futile. It is perfectly open to the Government, by an extension of the policy of last year, to deprive us altogether of that opportunity also. What security have we that that course will not be pursued, and that the next thing will be to take away the right of discussing the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill, which would require no alteration of the Standing Orders, but an act of discretion on the part of the Government? This is a proposal which I believe is unparalleled in the history of the House, and which threatens private Members with the destruction of their rights and privileges. For these reasons I most strongly protest against this innovation of our rights, which, I take it, is only a symptom and a sign of what we are to expect.</membercontribution></p>

rule, cither as a sessional or a permanent order. My experience has been that since the Conservative Government came into power private Members have been deprived almost of all their private rights in this House. Private Members can now only move Amendments to the Address and ask questions, and for the remainder of the session they seem to have no other legislative functions. If this process goes on much longer private Members will have absolutely no rights at all. It will come to this, that Members of Parliament will come here simply to vote Supplies and sit in Ways and Means, and take up such Government Bills as may be proposed by the party in power. I would ask the right hon. Gentleman to seriously consider this question, and to remember that in the past history of this Parliament many of the most important reforms which were passed into law were introduced by private Members, and not as Government measures.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01616"><member>MR. FIELD</member><membercontribution>: I bow to your ruling. Mr. Speaker; but my point is that, according to the speech of the right hon. Gentleman who introduced this motion, it is proposed to take away the time of private Members and the right to bring in legislation. It appears to me, if this motion is allowed to pass, that undoubtedly in the future private Members' rights will be much less than they are at the present time, and as an Irish Member, coming here with certain instructions from my constituents, undoubtedly my sphere of usefulness will be considerably shortened by this proposal. Some right hon. Members and hon. Members on the other side, including the hon. Member for King's Lynn, have spoken in a satirical way of private Members; but what do we come here for I Private Members are elected by constituents, and they are generally charged by them with the conveying of certain distinct grievances to this Mouse, and if this process goes on what opportunity will be left for a private Member to bring forward his grievances I We are now being closured and suppressed, and the
<col>432</col>
result is that private Members might as well stay at home as come and sit in this Parliament. Every hon. Member who comes to this House is charged by his constituents to bring forward some measure or other to remove a grievance in his Division, and when he gets here he finds out that there is no means of bringing the matter before the House. He may put down a private Bill, but, according to the system adopted by the present Government, the rights of; private Members are being gradually extinguished, and unless they take part in the debate on measures brought forward by the Government they have absolutely no power of making themselves heard in this House of Commons. Many of the questions brought forward by the Government are of immense importance as a rule, but the measures brought forward by private Members&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01617"><member>*MR. SPEAKER</member><membercontribution>: Order, order&#x0021; I must remind the hon. Member that the question of measures brought forward by the Government or by private Members has nothing whatever to do with this Amendment.</membercontribution></p>

FIELD</member><membercontribution>: I know that the closure which it is sought to inflict upon us by this motion confines us very much in this discussion, but I thought the point I was raising was relevant. I will simply wind up by saying that as a private Member I protest in the strongest possible way against the extinction of the right of free speech which ought to belong to every Member of this Assembly. We are sent here to exercise the right of free speech with respect to whatever grievance may apply to our constituents, and I enter my protest against this closure motion being accepted either as a sessional or a perpetual order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01619"><member>MR. ALEXANDER CROSS <memberconstituency>(Glasgow, Camlachie)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I cannot hope to add a single argument to what has already been said upon this question, but I must say that I have some sympathy with the Gentlemen on the front bench upon this occasion. I know that there are some hon. Members of this House, who can hardly be described as private Members, who take every opportunity afforded them of talking, and I think that is mainly the reason why it has become
<image src="S4V0090P0I0334"/>
<col>433</col>
necessary, in the public interest, to curtail some of those opportunities afforded to private Members in this House. What weighs with me on an occasion of this sort in voting away a privilege and a right of ancient standing is the consideration of what may he before us in times to come. No doubt there are some Members on this side of the House who have a regard for ancient traditions of this kind, and who bear in mind that there may come occasions upon which it may be necessary for private Members on this side to avail themselves of occasions like those to which this rule applies. I venture again to express my expectation that possibly the right hon. Gentleman and the Front Bench may content themselves with making this a sessional order, which would allow us to see how it worked, and which might enable us to find some other arrangement by which a restriction less extreme than this might come into force. I will not venture to add one word about the privileges of private Members, with which I sympathise very much. There are many questions which may be raised by private Members, and which when pressed upon the attention of the Front Bench give us a chance of bringing forward legislation, whereas if this alteration is made permanent we may be deprived of that chance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01620"><member>SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT <memberconstituency>(Monmouthshire, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: Having in former times occupied a similar position, I can naturally sympathise with the Gentlemen on the front bench opposite, and especially with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the present occasion. I feel almost bound to say a word or two to explain why it is that I intend to vote against the motion which my right hon. friend has brought forward. Governments representing both sides of the House have, in former times, often been hard pressed in this respect, but it has never before been found necessary to ask for this reduction in the time which is left to the unofficial Members of the House. I feel that the objection which has been taken to this practice arises out of the delaying of the Budget last year, and I certainly would, in the interests of all, ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take any remedy which is necessary to prevent
<col>434</col>
that occurring again. I am not surprised at the amount of irritation that was caused by the course taken by the hon. Member for King's Lynn in delaying the Budget statement last year, but I do think that when particular incidents of that kind arise they ought not to govern our action in dealing with the general principle of this Amendment. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman the First Lord of the Treasury and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the old proverb which says&#x2014;"Those who play bowls must expect to meet with rubbers." The persons who are entrusted by the majority of this House with conducting the business of the country ought not to be treated at all as the antagonists of any class of Members in this House, and if, as in the case of Supply, I saw that things had been abused, or likely to be abused, I should certainly support this motion. But it is admitted that this motion can only affect three occasions in the course of the session, unless we come to some extraordinary demand in the midst of the session, like the war loan or any other unexpected expenditure. If the Government is called upon to make some extraordinary demand upon this House, then it is quite right that the House should have an opportunity of discussing not only that particular Vote, but also the policy which rendered it necessary, and the opportunity which you get upon such an occasion for discussion is totally different to the opportunity which is given in Committee of Supply. Discussions on Votes of Supply are naturally limited in character, and are very properly confined to the limitations which belong to those particular Votes. I think that the most important occasion upon which unofficial Members are offered opportunities by this rule is the power of challenging general policy. In regard to the interposition of unimportant matters which might threaten to delay the introduction of the Budget resolutions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government can always protect themselves by a resolution giving precedence to the Budget over any other motions, and that will secure for the Government all that they require. By this means you will obviate that inconvenience, which I am sure everybody wishes to avoid, and you will not part with this
<image src="S4V0090P0I0335"/>
<col>435</col>
general principle, which I think is to the advantage of the House of Commons, for it gives you the opportunity of opening and discussing large questions which you could not otherwise discuss. I confess myself that I was always extremely reluctant to use the closure in reference to financial questions. When we had a very fierce debate upon financial questions, I flatter myself that I never used the closure once. I do not believe that the House will gain any power or advantage by making this alteration. I think the Government have all the security which they need in regard to the two occasions upon which we can raise a general debate upon the policy of the Government&#x2014;at the end of the financial year, in the month of April, and again at the end of the session, when you can review all that has taken place; and therefore I am not willing to deprive hon. Members of the House of an opportunity which they have enjoyed from time immemorial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01621"><member>*THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER (Sir M. HICKS BEACH, <memberconstituency>Bristol, W.</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: I am very reluctant to detain the House, but as this matter specially affects the Department over which I preside, I hope I may be permitted to say a few words. In the first place, I can assure the right hon. Gentleman opposite and the House that in proposing this amendment of the Standing Order we have not any idea of depriving hon. Members of opportunities of discussing general questions of policy which ought properly to be discussed. My right hon. friend the Leader of the House has during the course of the last three sessions, whenever he has been asked to give an opportunity of this kind, afforded it to the House by giving preference to some Vote connected with the subject on the Notice Paper. Of course. I am speaking of questions in which the country is generally interested. My right hon. friend has constantly, by putting down some Vote of Supply on a particular night, and by making arrangements of that sort, afforded those opportunities, and I am sure the right hon. Gentleman opposite will at once admit that in this respect he has fairly met the desire of the House. But this is not all, for my right hon.<lb/>
<col>436</col>
friend has altered the rule with regard to the number of days to be devoted to Votes in Supply, so as to give additional facilities during the present session for the discussion of a Vote of an important military character. That, I think, is another instance of the way my right hon. friend has constantly endeavoured to meet the desires of the House. But what we are dealing with now is a matter of a very different character. The hon. Member for King s Lynn has taken me to task for protesting against the manner in which he used his power under the existing rule of moving an Amendment on the order for going into Committee of Ways and Means. I did find fault with the hon. Gentleman, and I do so now, for I do not think it is quite fair to say that no instance of any abuse of that rule has been alleged to the House, for the hon. Member himself has admitted that the rule was abused. What happened? I remember perfectly well that towards the close of last session the House was expecting to hear a statement from me upon the mode of finding additional means for the prosecution of the war, and the hon. Member for King's Lynn intervened with a motion upon a subject which may have been a matter of importance in regard to receipts being intercepted without being paid into the Exchequer. He made a speech on that subject, and although he said it was a matter of importance and a matter of great interest to those who take an interest in financial questions, no other Member of the House took any part in that debate. I made a short reply, and there the matter ended. The hon. Member himself must have felt that his motion was ill-timed, because he has admitted that he did not and could not do justice to his subject under the circumstances, because he felt that the House was not prepared for a long speech. If that was the case, what was the good of the privilege to him if he could not do justice to the subject?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01622"><member>MR. GIBSON BOWLES</member><membercontribution>: Simply because I did not press my right under that rule. Had I done so, I could have driven the Budget into the next day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01623"><member>*SIR M. HICKS BEACH</member><membercontribution>: It has been said that motions of this sort have been
<image src="S4V0090P0I0336"/>
<col>437</col>
made only five times during a long I period of years. If this is true how can we by proposing to repeal the existing power seriously curtail the rights of private Members, who have so seldom taken advantage of these opportunities of raising a debate? It is because this power has been discovered and exercised that the Government are anxious to prevent it becoming a gross abuse and a serious interference with the proper conduct of business in this House. This House has felt it necessary, with the general consent of both sides, to curtail the opportunities for moving amendments on the motion that the Speaker do leave the chair on going into Committee of Supply. Is it seriously contended that this power, which has been restricted in relation to Supply, should remain unlimited in connection with the Committee of Ways and Means? My light hon. friend in moving this motion referred to the small number of occasions in the course of the session on which we have to place on the Paper the order for Committee of Ways and Means.<lb/>
I will endeavour to explain to the House, if I am not detaining it, precisely what happens. I think the occasions when such power may be exercised have been somewhat underrated by my right hon. friend and others. First of all there is the invariable motion after the passing of the Supplementary Estimates. This has always been taken, ever since I can remember, as a matter of course, until this year, when two notices of Amendments to the motion that the Speaker leave the chair have been placed on the Paper. Now it is proposed that our proceedings at the close of the financial year, when every day and every hour is always important, in order that financial business may close within the legal time, should be interfered with by motions of this kind. Then the next occasion is the annual Budget. The right hon. Gentleman who has just sat down entirely agrees with me that to interpose with a motion such as my hon. friend the Member for King's Lynn placed on the Paper, relating perhaps to the foreign affairs of the country generally, upon the Budget night would be an abuse; and it is proposed that this possibility shall be met by a special resolution
<col>438</col>
which, I suppose, will enable the Budget resolutions to be taken before the Amendment can be moved. What would that motion be? I suppose that it would be that the hon. Member who had placed a notice of Amendment on the Paper should not be heard, or that the Speaker should leave the chair without question put on that particular occasion. But, whatever the motion was, there would be nothing to prevent it being debated the whole evening. It is not because I happen to be Chancellor of the Exchequer that I say that nothing more inconvenient to the House, or even to the country, could take place. The whole course of the business of the session might be upset by the postponement in this manner of the Budget resolutions. I remember that on one occasion, when Mr. Gladstone was Chancellor of the Exchequer, some loquacious and industrious Member had put a notice of motion of this kind on the Paper. Mr. Gladstone made an appeal to the hon. Member, and he did not press his motion. [HON. MEMBERS: Hear, hear&#x0021;] Yes, but hon. Members are not all so anxious that the business of the House should be conducted. Mr. Gladstone said on that occasion that if the hon. Member had not given way he would have been compelled to make his Budget statement with the Speaker in the chair. What would have been the result of that? After the statement had been made some hon. Member might have got up and moved a motion, which might have been debated all night, with the result that there would have been no time for the Budget resolutions to be taken. No one knew better than the right hon. Gentleman opposite how utterly the whole finance of the country might have been disorganised by such a procedure. I venture to say that by no means except by passing some general resolution such as that proposed, can you possibly prevent a thing of that kind from taking place.<lb/>
But I go on to a further case. Throughout the consideration of the Budget by the House every year cases might arise in which it would be necessary again to set up the Committee of Ways and Means, so that there might be many occasions during the progress of an important Budget on which these motions
<image src="S4V0090P0I0337"/>
<col>439</col>
might be interposed. Finally, the same thing might happen at the end of the session, when the Appropriation Bill had to be founded on a resolution in Committee of Ways and Means. The hon. Member for King's Lynn referred to the Committee of 1861, but, contrasting the conduct of business in those days with the manner in which we are now forced to conduct it, I am certain that if those gentlemen who passed the resolutions of 1861 had had to deal with the difficulties that any Government has to deal with nowadays they would have been compelled to take steps to secure greater facilities for the conduct of business than they thought necessary then, Many lion, friends on this side of the House appear to think that by passing this Amendment we would be depriving ourselves of some very important weapon which might be used against hon. Gentlemen opposite should they ever get into power again. Although at one time I attached some importance to views of that kind, I have seen enough now of the proceedings of the House to be perfectly certain that no party, however anxious to stop legislation, can do so by mere obstruction of this kind. This means of bringing forward Amendments, which has been rediscovered by the hon. Member for King's Lynn, has been abused already, and unless the House, in the interest of the proper conduct of business, is prepared in some way to deal with it, it will be abused much more seriously in future.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01624"><member>MR. DALZIEL <memberconstituency>(Kirkcaldy Burghs)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: The right hon. Gentleman has made a very interesting speech in support of the motion, but I confess that he has not convinced me that the Government are justified in the course they are taking. There are two things obvious: first, that this is a party motion to be carried by a party majority, and, second, that even the party which supports the right hon. Gentleman is by no means unanimous in favour of his motion, because of the five hon. Members who have spoken, four have condemned it. The result is that the right hon. Gentleman comes forward with a motion for amending the Standing Order, and that he is using his overwhelming majority to make a
<col>440</col>
fundamental alteration in the rules of the House. But that is not all. The very case which the right hon. Gentleman puts forward for his resolution is, in my opinion, the best case against it. The right hon. Gentleman says that the rule has not been abused. It is true that the right hon. Gentleman intimated that there was an occasion when it might have been abused&#x2014;when an hon. Member put down a motion the evening on which Mr. Gladstone was about to introduce his Budget; but that motion was withdrawn when the hon. Member was appealed to. The only other case was when the hon. Member for King's Lynn had a motion on the Paper, but in deference to the wishes of the House, and on an appeal by the right hon. Gentleman himself, that debate was kept so short that only one hon. Gentleman spoke. I maintain, therefore, that no case has been brought forward by the Government which tends to show that there has been any abuse of the rule. It would be impossible on a Budget night for any hon. Member to bring forward a motion on a frivolous pretext to interfere with the business which the House and country were waiting to hear. It seems to me that a case has not been made out by the Government for a resolution which should only have been brought forward for sound reasons. It is a curious thing that this motion should be brought at a time when private Members have hardly any privileges left, and it is not very difficult for the House to see that there may come a time when we shall not have so courteous a Leader of the House or Chancellor of Exchequer as we have now&#x2014;it is quite conceivable that a time may come when, by means of this motion, the whole of the privileges of private Members will be taken away. It is because this is one of the last few remaining privileges possessed by private Members&#x2014;one of the only opportunities we have of bringing motions before the House&#x2014;that I object to this motion being passed. The motion now before the House simply means that on the Budget night or on Budget i resolutions the Speaker will leave the chair without question put, which will preclude any subject arising on Budget night being discussed. Therefore the Opposition would, in my opinion, be
<image src="S4V0090P0I0338"/>
<col>441</col>
neglecting their duty in supporting this motion. It seems to me that the Government have not made out their case in favour of this proposal, and they have shown no urgency whatever; and, as no ground has been shown, I think it is a case where independent Members on both sides of the House should join in making an emphatic protest.</membercontribution></p>

The Government, in order to get rid of the difficulty, gave him a night, and, although he was beaten in the division upon the application of the principle of the Agricultural Rates Act. the Government, a fortnight afterwards, came down and applied the principle of the Rates Act to Ireland, and gave Ireland &#x00A3;600,000; so that on that occasion at any rate this privilege resulted in a benefit to Ireland.

<title>BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE<lb/> (FINANCIAL BUSINESS).</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01629"><member>MR. A. J. BALFOUR</member><membercontribution>: I think the House is already familiar with all the reasons for the motion which I now move. They are substantially the same as those we offered to the House last week when a similar motion was before it, although they are now of greater urgency. On the present occasion I would remind the House exactly how our financial business stands so far as the principle is concerned. If my motion is agreed to there are only twelve days for effective Supply before Monday, the 25th inst. On that day we must introduce the Consolidated Fund Bill in order to comply with the law. In two days we obtained ten Supplementary Votes out of twenty-nine, not a very promising beginning. We have to take large Supplementary Estimates, and we have to take, both as regards the Army and the Navy, but perhaps especially as regards the Army, a most important discussion upon the Speaker leaving the chair; and my right hon. friend the Secretary of State for War proposes on Friday next to make his speech on the Army Estimates. I do not see how it is possible to get through this mass of work before the 25th unless the privileges which we ask for are granted. On the present occasion the House will see we ask for no privileges except as regards finance. We do not ask for privileges for legislative work
<col>446</col>
of any kind outside the necessities of the law, and we do not ask for Wednesdays, though, if the House insists upon discussing the Estimates at great length, I may be driven, much against my will, to ask for privileges as regards Wednesdays before the 25th.<lb/>
I make this request with great reluctance. I have been attacked on both sides of the House by Gentlemen who seem to think I am an enemy of the privileges of unofficial Members. That is entirely untrue. I have always done my very best as Leader of the House to give private Members the fullest opportunity of criticising the Government, and I think my action in that respect will compare favourably with that of my predecessors. I take it it is a fact that at present we lose something materially by not having those opportunities on Tuesdays of general discussion upon subjects outside the business of Supply, or the Budget, or the business of legislation. And it is also perfectly true that when the House retains its privilege in this respect it usually shows its appreciation by a count out; but something might be done, though I make no promise, to secure a certain number of days, at all events, in the session on which abstract resolutions may be brought before the House. In the meantime, having regard to the necessities of the hour, if the House intends to comply with the law, it should take Tuesdays for financial business.<lb/>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0341"/>
<col>447</col>
We have been told that this is a state of things for which the Government is responsible in not having called Parliament together earlier. That is a most unjustifiable statement on the part of lion. Members, seeing that the House had an autumn session. [A VOICE: A very short one.] Not a very long autumn session; but if these days which are now asked for had been added it would have made it abnormally long, and I saw no reason, and see no reason, why this House should be asked to meet earlier than it did. If the question had been put to them, and hon. Members had been allowed to vote according to their inclinations, as to whether the House should be called together on the 14th February or a week earlier. I wonder how the division would have gone. I am tolerably certain that the most officious of my critics would have said they were directly opposed to not giving the House a holiday. I am myself indifferent to the criticisms as to whether or not the House ought to have been called together earlier. As regards the present, we are bound to obey the law, and if the exhibition which we have had for the last two days continues we may have to ask not only for Tuesdays but for Wednesdays also. But I take no right to interfere with Tuesdays, except for Supply, and, therefore, if the House decides to dispose of Supply, the Tuesdays will be restored to private Members, and have no doubt, if the House is offered the plain choice of either discussing and passing the Estimates, or breaking the law, which they will choose. Under these circumstances I hope the resolution I now beg to move will be accepted.<lb/>
Motion made, and Question proposed, "That, until Easter, Financial Business do have precedence on Tuesday whenever set down by the Government, and that the provisions of Standing Order No. 50 be extended to that day."&#x2014;(<i>Mr. Balfour.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01630"><member>SIR H. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN</member><membercontribution>: I am one of those who, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly says and suggests, that the House should have met earlier, and whose suggestion he treated with no little ignominy and scorn, and upon that ground I cannot agree to this proposal. I quite admit that the right hon. Gentle-
<col>448</col>
man, having placed himself in the position in which he stands, can make out a strong case for taking Tuesday, Wednesday, and every other day in the week. But this is not the way to conduct important business of this House, above all the business of Supply, where everything that has to be done is to be done with a sort of Damocles' sword hanging over one's head. We are told that we have to pass these Votes, however large they may be, on a certain day, to do which we must curb our inclinations to discuss them in the manner in which we consider they ought to be discussed. This is not the first time the House of Commons has been asked to take a similar course, but I have never known an occasion such as this in which it was so obvious beforehand what the result would be. There is no novelty whatever in it&#x2014;the only novelty is the unusual size of the Supplementary Estimates; we knew they would be excessive, but we never had the slightest idea that, at a time when we were to be asked to meet great demands for war expenditure, the Civil Service Estimates would exceed by a million the normal Estimates. In my humble judgment it was the Government's business to have foreseen that the present state of affairs would arise, and to have provided for it by calling Parliament together sooner. Being in this dilemma, the Government are reduced to taking these strong measures. But that does not make me regard the strong measures with the less dislike, and as a protest against them I shall certainly vote against the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01631"><member>MR. HERBERT ROBERTS <memberconstituency>(Denbighshire, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> felt bound to protest against the course which had been taken by the Government. The Government would, he thought, get through their financial business much more quickly and much more satisfactorily if they showed some disposition to meet the views of lion. Members, and allowed them to have, retained Tuesdays for discussing subjects in which they were interested. There was no reason why the Government should not get through their financial business without special procedure, and he was bound to protest against the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01632"><member>MR. DALY <memberconstituency>(Monaghan, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> expressed his great surprise at the proposals
<image src="S4V0090P0I0342"/>
<col>449</col>
before the House. He thought it was hardly worth the while of the right lion. Gentleman to make the suggestion that he would only interfere with Tuesdays in order to take financial business, because after that was disposed of hon. Gentlemen would no doubt find the Government Whips at</membercontribution></p>

<title>NAVY (SUPPLEMENTARY) ESTIMATES,<lb/> 1900&#x2013;1901.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01639">1. Motion made, and Question put, "A. That an additional number of men and boys, not exceeding 600, be employed for the Sea and Coastguard Services for the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1901."</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01640"><member>*THE CIVIL LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY (Mr. PRETYMAN, <memberconstituency>Suffolk, Woodbridge</memberconstituency>),</member><membercontribution> in the absence of the Financial Secretary, desired to say a few words in explanation of the Vote. The 600 men now asked for comprised the colonial contingent in China. New South Wales provided 262; Victoria, 197; and South Australia, 120, with the "Protector," gunboat. It was necessary under the Colonial Naval Defence Act of 1865, Section 9, to obtain the sanction of Parliament in order to bear those men on the Votes. Ho did not ask the House to believe that these men were necessary in order to give effect to the naval strength of the mother country in China. It was not the actual force, but the moral force which lay behind which was in question. The value in the eyes of the Empire and of the world of that small body of 600 men, side by side with our own sailors, soldiers and marines, was such that he did not think there would be any difference of opinion in the House in regard to the Vote. All the Members of the House were familiar with the services rendered by those men. The Colonial contingent had been most honourably mentioned by the commanding officer on the station. Their services were most valuable and were most highly appreciated, and their gallantry was conspicuous upon all occasions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01641"><member>MR. KEARLEY <memberconstituency>(Devonport)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> was sure that they all agreed with what had been said by the hon. Gentleman as to the good effect that must accrue from the services of those men. They had served side by side with our own seamen, and nobody would doubt at all the value of
<col>454</col>
their services. He asked whether the hon. Gentleman could tell the Committee what the arrangements were in regard to the pay of those men.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01642"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: The question of pay falls to be considered on the next Vote. It will be better to discuss one Vote at a time.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01643"><member>MR. DILLON <memberconstituency>(Mayo, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the hon. Gentleman in charge of the Vote was entirely mistaken if he supposed that it was going to pass with the unanimity of all sections of the Committee. For his part, he had for a considerable period of years resisted on every occasion additions to the Navy, whether they appeared in the shape of a Vote for men and boys, or an increased money grant, because he was convinced&#x2014;and every year that passed added strength to the conviction&#x2014; that the policy inaugurated by this country six years ago of enormous in creases to the Navy was a policy calculated to destroy the finances of the country, and greatly calculated to plunge the country sooner or later into a terrible war. When a few Members commenced to oppose this policy a few years ago they were denounced, of course, as enemies of the country. They were laughed at as enemies of the Empire for venturing to prophesy that the increase commenced five or six years ago was only a small portion of what was coming. He remembered, five years ago when the First Lord of the Admiralty, now in another place, brought in one of the vast Navy Estimates and announced that they were undoubtedly of a startling character, but required by the necessity of the time. The House was startled, but it voted the Estimates under the illusion, which had now been dissipated, that by so voting it was placing the country in a position of security and defence, and that if there was not finality in them there was some thing approaching finality. Every year there had been a large increase in the Vote for men and boys, and the expenses of the Navy. He asked where this was going to stop. He believed it would not stop until the taxation of the country was raised to such a point that the people would rebel and revolt against it. He desired to say that those who had banded themselves into an organisation
<image src="S4V0090P0I0345"/>
<col>455</col>
called the Navy League were primarily responsible for this mad career along which the country was now being driven. What did they find these gentlemen saying after five years of inflation and enormous additions to the size of the Navy? They were now declaring that England was in a worse position at sea, and a worse mistress of the seas than five or six years ago. The more they spent on the Army and Navy the more they would be told that the state of the country was alarming, and they would have to go on increasing the size of the Services. He felt bound at every stage to resist any increase of armaments. He would vote against the proposed increase.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01644"><member>MR. DALY <memberconstituency>(Monaghan, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> had great pleasure in joining his voice to what had been said by the hon. Member for East Mayo. The hon. Member for the Wood-bridge Division had referred to the fact that 600 Colonial troops had come to help England in a difficulty. Considering that from so large an extent of country only 600 troops could be raised, he thought the hon. Member should not have mentioned that. It seemed to him that the colonies gave them very little sympathy if, when England was in trouble, only 600 men could be got to come to the help of the country. He asked how these troops were to be paid as compared with the troops of this country, because it struck him that if a very great inducement had not been offered to these men from the colonies it was quite possible that they would not have come to the help of England at all. It seemed to him that the amount of money in this Vote was extraordinary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01645"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: There is no money in this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01646"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution> admitted that, but at the same time he expected that the men did not come without money, and one of the points which Members from Ireland had to watch was the money point. He had no sympathy, ho was proud to say, with this matter at all, and he thought the colonies had almost as little when the trifling number of 600 was all they could beg, borrow, and, he might say, steal to join the forces. It would be his duty to go into the division lobby against this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<col>456</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01647"><member>*MR. CORRIE GRANT <memberconstituency>(Warwickshire, Rugby)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: said he understood from what was stated by the hon. Member for Woodbridge in introducing the Vote, that it was desirable to give the colonies an opportunity of taking part in the operations in China, and therefore these men were selected to go, and charged on the Estimates. If so, why should the hon. Member for South Monaghan talk of sweeping the gutters to get men I He would go into the lobby in support of the Vote, as ho believed a great many Members on that side of the House would, because they desired, along with hon. Members opposite, to do everything they could to strengthen the bonds between the mother country and the colonies.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01648"><member>MR. ALLEN <memberconstituency>(Gloucestershire, Stroud)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> entirely concurred with the hon. Member who had just spoken, and he intended to vote for the number of men stated. He did not think that, being a new Member, he should have got up to speak if one of the Members from Ireland had not attacked the Navy League, with which he had been more or less intimately acquainted since the commencement. He thought the Navy League had done a great deal of good in bringing home to the country the necessity of having a strong and large Navy. A great number on that side of the House would agree with him that it had been a distinct advantage to have the Australian and other Colonial forces fighting by our side.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01649"><member>MR. CULLINAN <memberconstituency>(Tipperary, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said his hon. friend had a perfect right to condemn the policy of the Navy League. He concurred with the hon. Member for South Monaghan that it spoke badly for the sympathy of the colonies when they could only find 600 men. The Nationalist Members looked at this question in relation to the taxes they were going to put on their country, and he claimed that they had a perfect right to object to the Vote, on which no information had been supplied.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01650"><member>MR. WILLIAM ALLAN <memberconstituency>(Gateshead)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he was surprised at the paucity of the number stated in the Vote. He was afraid that 600 was a misprint, and
<image src="S4V0090P0I0346"/>
<col>457</col>
that there should have been another 0 added. He failed to see how 600 could supply the deficiency required. It had always been the fault of the Navy administrators of this country to ask for too few men. In this case he felt sure that they were committing the same blunder again, and when the proper Navy Estimates came on they would be asking for more men. He had always advocated that it was the duty of the Government broadly and honestly to put down the number they required, so that the House and the country would know what they required. It was well known that they would require ten times the number now put down.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01651"><member>MR. JOYCE <memberconstituency>(Limerick)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he desired to raise his voice against this Supplementary Estimate of a million and a quarter of money for 600 men. ["Order."] If he was out of order in referring to the amount, the Chairman was there to put him in order. [Laughter.] He would not take any laugh from Gentlemen on the other side. If he committed any breach of the rules he would bow to the ruling of the Chairman at once. He desired to say that this Supplementary Estimate for 600 men would cause the expenditure of a large amount of money. It appeared to him to be an anomaly when he looked at the fact that if they required a Catholic chaplain for the British Navy&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01652"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: That cannot be discussed on this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01653"><member>MR. JOYCE</member><membercontribution>: I bow to your ruling at once, Mr. Lowther, and I have just to say that when I am a little better acquainted with the business of the House I will interfere oftener and with more effect</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01665"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: in asking for this Vote it will probably be convenient to the Committee that I should make a short statement on the different heads under winch the money is required. With regard to the Vote of 600 men just passed, the actual cost of their services was about &#x00A3;25,000. The contingent are paid by us at the same rate of pay and allowances as our own sailors, and they are calculated to serve for about seven months. Besides that, we are giving to the South Australian Government a sum of &#x00A3;2,500 for the services of the "Protector," because we have not only these 600 men, but also the "Protector," which is the property
<col>462</col>
of the South Australian Government. For repairs to that vessel during the time it was in the Imperial service wear paying &#x00A3;2,500 to its owners. The next head is the increase in the victualling charges. It will be recognised by all that since the time these Estimates were originally prepared there has been an enormous rise in the prices of all kinds of produce, and that rise has caused an increase of no less than &#x00A3;114,000, but against that there is an appropriation-in-aid of &#x00A3;30,000, reducing the actual Vote to &#x00A3;84,000. I might give one or two instances showing how prices have risen. Cloth has risen from 6s. 11d. to 8s. 11d., and serge from 11&#x215B;d. to 1s. 3&#x00BC;d., and so on, and the prices of provisions have increased in the same way. These increases have in nearly all cases come about and been largely augmented since the time the original Estimates were prepared. There was at the time some indication of a rise in prices, but the Estimates were prepared fifteen months ahead of the time at which they were voted, and it was impossible to say when the rise would take place. The same remark applies to the question of coal in Section 2 of Vote 8. It is a very difficult question to decide whether a rise in price is going to be permanent, and the question also arises as to the latest date on which it is possible to disturb a Vote once prepared. It is very difficult when a complicated Estimate has been prepared on the basis of prices then existing to go into it and revise all the items, and there is the further point that the rise in price may be only temporary. So far as we are concerned, the increase in prices of
<image src="S4V0090P0I0349"/>
<col>463</col>
coal, provisions, and clothing material, has been not temporary but permanent, and that is really the reason of the large increase in the victualling Vote, and, to some extent, the coaling Vote. The next head is shipbuilding and repairs, the amount there being &#x00A3;98,500. That increase is caused partly by more rapid construction and partly by repairs. Construction has been hastened, and I think the Committee will agree that that is not a cause for complaint. To-morrow an event will occur which is almost unique in the history of the British Navy. Four first-class vessels will be launched, and it is largely on account of the expenditure on these four vessels that this excess is asked for. &#x00A3;30,000 is for new construction, most of which has been spent on the "Montague," the "Albemarle," and the "Kent." The amount expended upon these three vessels during this financial year is no less than &#x00A3;629,000, so that an excess of &#x00A3;30,000 on that large sum will not appear very great. At the same time, I think the Committee would prefer that we should have an excess of &#x00A3;30,000 and succeed in turning these vessels out than that the vessels should have been delayed and &#x00A3;30,000 less spent. That is the real ground on which the money is asked for. Included in that &#x00A3;98,000 is a further sum for repairs to a large number of ships. There are two reasons why the repairs have exceeded the Estimate. One is a reason which will naturally occur to every hon. Member&#x2014;namely, that during the year we have had this unforeseen trouble in China, and nobody knew at what moment the services of the Navy might be required in all directions. It therefore became imperative to execute all repairs immediately, and that every vessel which could be brought at short notice into a fit condition for service should be put into that condition. That naturally involved the working o overtime, and that accounts to a largo extent for this increase. The other reason is that it is not advisable in the interests of economy to allow a larger estimate for repairs than the lowest sum which really appears necessary, as whatever is allowed is pretty certain to be spent. It is desirable that the full sum anticipated to be required should be estimated. It
<col>464</col>
is very undesirable that it should be necessary to come here for Supplementary Votes at all. We should very much prefer to be able to state fifteen months beforehand exactly how much we are going to spend and exactly what we are going to do with the money. But if hon. Members will put themselves into the position of those who have to administer this great Department, look at the enormous number of items over which this work has to be spread, and conceive the difficulty of looking fifteen months ahead and estimating exactly how much will be required to be spent on repairs, for instance, which may be owing to accidents or breakdowns which nobody can foresee, it must be evident to them that, however much experience may be brought to bear or time given to the matter, such Estimates must to a large extent be guesswork, based partly upon the experiences of the past as well as upon the possibilities of the future. On that ground the Admiralty has perhaps more excuse than almost any other Department for coming to the Committee with a Supplementary Estimate, which is not very large in relation to the amount of work done, and all of which has been expended in putting our Navy into a state of efficiency such as the House of Commons is always impressing upon us as absolutely necessary.<lb/>
The next item is one for which I need not apologise at all&#x2014;namely, contract work. We have succeeded in getting more work to the extent of &#x00A3;270,000 out of the contractors than we estimated we could do. That is not increased, but merely anticipated expenditure. We are paving &#x00A3;270.000 more to contractors in this financial year for work they had hi hand, and therefore shall have that much less to pay at the end of the contract. Really, the contract is being executed more rapidly than had been anticipated.</membercontribution></p>

The last head is for miscellaneous services, the larger part of which is in con-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0350"/>
<col>465</col>
sequence of the services of the naval contingent and the fleet in connection with the trouble in China. It is perfectly clear that the China trouble was an unforeseen event in regard to which we are perfectly justified in asking for a Supplementary Vote, and therefore no excuse is needed for bringing this Estimate forward. Sub-head A is for the passage money and conveyance of the Australian contingent both by water and by land, and also of the additional officers who were sent to China. Sub-head C, for piloting and towing, is largely and principally due to extra charges incurred by the extra number of vessels going through the Suez Canal on their way to China. "Telegraphic communications" refer to the extra telegraphic services in connection with South Africa and China. The hire of steam vessels for communications in China is in connection with two vessels which were hired to keep up communications between different places. The next head is expenditure in connection with the seizure and detention of vessels in South African waters. In that matter the Navy was merely obeying its orders and doing its duty, and the matter has already been discussed. "The hire of distilling vessels for man&#x0153;uvres" was an experiment. Two vessels were fitted as distillers, and valuable experience was gained. The vessels were somewhat too large, they had not sufficient pumping power, but at the same time they supplied a considerable quantity of water for the fleet, and the experiment was well worth trying.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01668"><member>MR. FLYNN <memberconstituency>(Cork, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: Was there distilling of spirits in these vessels, or was the experiment confined to water?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01669"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: Although it was off the Irish coast, the experiment was confined to water. The last sub-head is in connection with the steamship "Ophir," which is to convey their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York on their tour to Australia and round the world. The only question of importance, I think, which has been raised in connection with that is with regard to the accommodation to be provided for the press. Questions have been asked upon
<col>466</col>
this matter in the House, and some hon. Members seem to be under the impression that Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, who is to go with this vessel, has been, by the sanction of the Admiralty, allowed to go on board as the correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> to the exclusion of other newspapers and other press correspondents. That is not so. Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace has had no communication with the Admiralty whatever in regard to his position on the tour, and he has not been appointed with the knowledge of the Admiralty as the correspondent of any newspaper whatever. But entirely apart from that, the First Lord has felt that it is most desirable, in the interest of the public and of the press, that some representation should be allowed, and that as far as possible some accommodation should be provided for the gentlemen of the press to accompany this expedition, and he has received a very large number of applications. He answered all these applicants, and they were informed that there were very great difficulties in the way of providing accommodation at all, but that everything that could be done would be done. The First Lord felt that it was very desirable that all the applications received should be considered equally, and not only did he wait until the last moment, but those important newspapers that had not applied for accommodation were communicated with and asked if they desired to be represented. That being done, every effort was made to induce the various newspapers and press agencies as far as possible to combine so that one press representative might serve two or three newspapers or agencies. That having been done, the First Lord found that he could provide accommodation for five press correspondents, and those five have been allotted as fairly as possible between the press agencies and the principal newspapers by combination, so that there has been absolute fairness. Those five gentlemen will be accommodated, and five berths have been prepared for them, and they will sail on Thursday.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman who introduced the Supplementary Estimate of &#x00A3;1,250,000. He had no desire to traverse all the headings of the hon. Gentleman's remarks, but would confine himself to the third.<lb/>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01673"><member>MR. WILLIAM ALLAN (continuing)</member><membercontribution> said that there came under the heading of "Coals for Steam Vessels" the sum of &#x00A3;700,000; but the hon. Gentleman gave the Committee no explanation whatever as to when, how, or where this &#x00A3;700,000 extra was required over and above the original Estimate. It was all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that the price of coal had risen, but his point was, when was the contract made by the Admiralty for coals? He was fully aware that in October, 1899, no contract was made for coals, although that was the time when every ship-owning firm, such as the Transatlantic General Company, the Royal Mail Steamship Company, etc., were making their contracts. The Admiralty could have bought coals then at 13s. per ton. Two or three months later the Admiralty went into the market and bought a small quantity at 19s. a ton, but made no contract. Then they had to go again into the market and paid 29s. a ton, but they bought more coals at the big price than they had any need for then, and which they would not need for a long time to come. Was that business? Why, the Director of Contracts knew no more about his business or the markets than the man in the moon&#x0021; The hon.
<col>468</col>
Gentleman smiled. He (Mr. Allan) had for seven or eight years been treated to laughter in the House over naval matters, but he challenged the hon. Gentleman to deny that he could have bought those coals at 13s. a ton for which he had paid 29s. a ton. The hon. Gentleman tried to put off this enormously increased expenditure on the ground of the rise in the price of coal, but he wished the hon. Gentleman would find out something about the coals and where they went to. The hon. Gentleman did not tell the Committee why this excess of coals was required, or that some of his boats were burning twice as much coal as others. That was the reason why the taxpayers' money was being squandered in a haphazard, un business like manner.<lb/>
He bad listened with attention to every word the hon. Gentleman had said about repairs, but no proper explanation had been given. What boats were repaired, where were they repaired, and what did the repairs of each cost? What did this sum of &#x00A3;98.500 include? The repairs to the "Hermes," the "Europa," or the "Powerful," which was lying in Portsmouth Dockyard with her boilers nearly out of her? Then, he was sorry to say that this huge sum did not include repairs to the new Royal yacht, which indeed was not afloat yet. It was not fair to the House of Commons or to the taxpayers of the country that they should be called upon to vote money for repairs without the responsible Minister stating to the House what was the nature of the repairs. He did not want to use strong terms to any Minister or head of the Department, but the Minister ought really to be able to give a lucid, frank, and complete explanation of the Vote he was submitting to the Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01674"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution> said, if the Committee would allow him, be might state that he had given a short statement of the headings of the Vote and a general explanation; but he would be most happy to answer any further questions that were put to him in the course of the debate. He thought that the hon. Member had scarcely been fair in accusing him of want of courtesy or a desire to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0352"/>
<col>469</col>
withhold information from the, Committee.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01675"><member>MR. WILLIAM ALLAN</member><membercontribution> said he was very glad to hear that the Committee was going to have a full explanation of why all this money was required for coals and repairs, and he sincerely hoped they would have the names of the boats and the reasons why the repairs were, necessary. The Paper did not show how much had been spent on the new Royal yacht. Did that come under repairs? The House and the country wanted to know that. He wished to refer also to one item under the head of "Miscellaneous Effective Services." Under Sub-head XX. very un business like phraseology was used&#x2014;namely, "Hire, etc., of s.s. 'Ophir.'" Now that word "hire" had no right to be there at all. There was not a shipowner in the House who did not know that the word should have been "charter." He asked how much the charter of the "Ophir" was to be per month&#x2014;what did the owners get? There was &#x00A3;43,000 down for the "Ophir," and what he wanted to know was not only the amount of the charter per month, but what was spent in refitting all the cabins, saloons, and berths, and on the accommodation for the crew, and also on the equipment of the vessel. To come here with a brief, condensed statement, like that put into the hands of hon. Members, was not taking the House into the confidence of the Government in the whole of this transaction. This was a matter of ship-owning and ship-management, and the Government ought to have been able to convey their Royal Highnesses the Duke, and Duchess of Cornwall on this tour on the new Royal yacht, instead of being compelled to charter another ship. It was their duty to tell the Committee every penny of expenditure on that chartered ship, instead of coming there with the word "hire," as if it were a cab-horse or pianos and bands of music, lie for one protested earnestly against the Minister responsible coming to the Committee with such flimsy pretexts, and he would at all times raise his voice against squandering the public money in such large sums without the slightest explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01676"><member>MR. FLYNN</member><membercontribution> said that no one could have listened to the hon. Member for
<col>470</col>
Gateshead without being forcibly impressed with his striking arguments. They all recognised the improvement in the manner of the hon. Gentleman responsible for the Vote compared with that of some of his predecessors; but they would await with interest the further explanations which had been promised. As to the matter of principle, before going into details he took it that this increased expenditure the Committee were asked for was was bound up with the reckless expenditure on which the country had launched in regard both to the Army and Navy. We were formerly supposed to be in a position to meet a combination of any two foreign naval Powers, but now we were going to meet any combination of any three Powers; hence the increased Estimates year after year. They had been told in the language of metaphor that a large portion of this expenditure was in the nature of insurance money for the protection of the commerce and trade of the Empire; but if that were so, Irish Members had a right to protest, seeing that they had no commerce to protect, against being compelled to pay their proportion of the insurance mney. What guarantee had the, Board of Admiralty in constructing these big battleships at such a rapid rate that they would not be obsolete and useless five or ten years hence&#x2014; just as our artillery had been found of no account against modern "Long Toms" and "Pom-Poms" in South Africa. These ships might, in fact, in a few years be broken up and sold for old scrap iron. That was a danger which naval constructors should lay to their mind, considering the marvellous skill now being applied to modern artillery and projectiles, and to submarine boats and torpedo boats. His motto, indeed, would be <i>festina lente</i> when they remembered that a naval engagement, which only lasted a few hours, between an Austrian and an Italian man-o'-war in the Adriatic had revolutionised the system of naval construction of the whole world. The hon. Member for Gateshead, who had compelled the Government to reconsider the whole question of the adoption of Belleville boilers, had given very alarming figures as to the purchases of coal, which showed the imprudent, the improvident, and
<image src="S4V0090P0I0353"/>
<col>471</col>
slatternly manner in which the Admiralty conducted their business, and some further explanations were demanded from the hon. Gentleman in charge of the Estimate in regard to this matter. If such things had occurred fifteen or twenty years previously, when the Government was confronted with a vigilant and active Opposition, no Board of Admiralty would have held their position for six months. With regard to the royal yacht, this vessel was not fit to carry the person of the King, and yet &#x00A3;400,000 had been spent upon it. The Estimates were brought before the House without any details, but these were questions the Admiralty were bound to answer, they were matters upon which the country would require information. In the good old times, in circumstances such as these, the First Lord or the Civil Lord of the Admiralty would have been impeached, and dismissed as being incapable of doing public service. The right of free search for contraband of war was a right which should only be exercised with the greatest possible prudence and discrimination, and only when there was overwhelming proof that vessels under neutral flags were carrying contraband of war; otherwise every country with a powerful navy like that of England would become nothing less than a highway robber. All they would have to do would be to point their guns, claim the right of search, take all the food-stuffs they discovered, and then go before a court and get the ship condemned, and the taxpayer would have to pay. If such a power was attempted to be exercised by Germany, France, or the United States, the whole press of the country would howl with indignation against such high-handed tyranny. Yet the country had to pay &#x00A3;.30.000 for this little diversion of the Admiralty. Another point upon which some information would be required was the item of &#x00A3;2.500 under Sub-head A.A., for the use of the South Australian gunboat during service in Chinese waters. Was that for the purpose of protecting the Colonial Volunteers, of which the House had heard so much, because they were so loyal? The Government would not give Ireland a gunboat for the protection of her fishermen, but for this boat, which belonged to the colony,
<col>472</col>
and which we used for the transport of the colonists, the country was asked to pay this amount. The loyalty of the colony was not so great, after all, and he could quite conceive that the Government might have greater loyalty in Ireland under similar conditions. With regard to the item under Sub-head XX., Hire, etc., of ss. "Ophir," in connection with the visit of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York to Australia, etc., "hire" was not a very elegant word. It was not the proper way to treat Royalty, and it gave a very bad impression in the country to talk of such a vessel in the same way as one would of a row-boat on the Thames. Another question upon which the hon. Gentleman might be able at some future time to give some information was with regard to the policy of construction which at present was being so strongly advocated. Was it a wise and prudent policy to build these ships, as to the strength of which they knew nothing, when other nations were turning their attention to submarine vessels? He thought not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01677"><member>COMMANDER YOUNG <memberconstituency>(Berkshire, Wokingham)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he was unable to follow the last speaker in his suggestion that the policy of the Admiralty in constructing battleships was not wise, having regard to the fact that other nations were keeping pace with us. There was no doubt that France was building submarine vessels, and it was possible that those, boats might revolutionise the Navy; but it was not with the submarine boat alone that we should have to compete. We had to compete with the range of guns, and the speed of ships on the billows. No doubt the Admiralty would keep their eye on these submarine boats, and, if they built any, all he would ask would be that he might not be ordered to serve on one. As an up-bolder of the Government, he did not desire to detain the Committee. He desired to see the Votes go through. When the Naval Estimates came forward would be the proper time to discuss these matters. But as a naval officer he would like to have a satisfactory answer to one question, which was, whether the hon. gentleman could give any information as to when the Report of the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0354"/>
<col>473</col>
Committee now sitting on the question of rations and, victualling of seamen was likely to be laid on the Table of the House. Every day was of importance in this matter. A great deal of money was spent, especially by the young and growing bluejackets, on provisions, which clearly showed that they required a great deal more food than was supplied by the Admiralty. He hoped the Report would be laid on the Table shortly, and that the result would be satisfactory. With regard to the item of pilotage under Sub-head C, he hoped the hon. Gentleman would be able to inform the House that there was no falling off in the pilotage qualities of the naval officer. Pilotage was a responsible duty, requiring care and nerve, which would have to be performed by the, naval officer in time of war, and the Admiralty should give as much encouragement as possible to naval officers to perfect themselves in this duty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01678"><member>MR. KEARLEY</member><membercontribution> said he did not think the Government ought to take a Vote of this character unless they were prepared to give the Committee the fullest opportunity of discussing it in every way and were prepared to answer every question which was put. Whatever might be said about the difficulty in contracting for coal, was the Committee to understand that the Admiralty had not sufficient foresight to make forward contracts for clothing and provisions for their sailors? It appeared to him that if these departments were properly managed the Admiralty ought not to have to come to the Committee and say that owing to the rise in the price of provisions and cloth they had had to pay &#x00A3;14,000 more of the taxpayers' money. If any private business was conducted in that way it would spell bankruptcy in a very short time. The fact of the matter was that neither the Navy nor the Army was run on a commercial basis. The gentlemen who managed these Departments were no doubt excellent men, but they had no commercial knowledge, and no one who had commercial knowledge to assist them. If they had had commercial training they would have saved their salaries over and over again. Everybody was aware from the debate in the previous
<col>474</col>
year that the food was inadequate, the meal-times out of joint, and the canteen arrangements unsatisfactory, A Committee had been sitting on this question for some time, and possibly the Committee might be told now whether any decision had been arrived at, and if so, what. No doubt the most important of the items on the Estimate was that dealing with construction, but there was an idea, abroad that although the Admiralty made a great display of shipbuilding it was only on paper. What the country wanted to know when they provided the money was that there would be in due course ships in commission and not upon paper. One serious cause of delay arose no doubt out of the contract work. There were four ships built in Government yards which would instance this. The "Ocean," the first ship laid down, was launched seventeen months after it was laid down, and it was not commissioned until some three years after. The "Implacable" was launched thirteen months after being laid down, and almost three years had elapsed since that time, and yet she was not commissioned. She had had some difficulties, and she had not yet passed her steam trials; that was the fault not of the Government, but of the contractor, but the Committee ought to be informed what steps had been taken or were contemplated by the Government for the purpose of dealing with the contractors who were responsible. The "Bulwark" was launched seven months after being laid down, the quickest launch on record, and she was not yet in commission; whilst in the case of the "Montague," which was launched sixteen months after being laid down, it was impossible to say when she would be commissioned. He drew attention to the different times at which the ships were launched to show that there was no plan in the building of these ships. It had been stated over and over again by experts that it was quite possible to commission a ship within twenty months of her being laid down, but in any case two years should be ample time. That time should also be ample to obtain the machinery, but one mistake the Government made was not to give out their contracts for
<image src="S4V0090P0I0355"/>
<col>475</col>
machinery until months after the ship was laid down. Our difficulty was that the Admiralty rarely laid down more than two ships of a type, so that the contractors had no opportunity of duplicating the machinery. He thought he had heard the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Forest of Dean urge the advantage of having half-a-dozen ships projected at a time. Whether he suggested it or not, the hon. Member thought it was a practical suggestion. The public were anxious to have these ships delivered in a reasonable time. Some ships which were being built by contract had been in course of construction three or four years, but as they were voted upon every year the public outside fancied that we were adding to our battleships every year. Ho was glad to see, therefore, from these Supplementary Estimates that there was some evidence that the Admiralty were alive to their responsibilities. He hoped the Admiralty would tell them something that night as to their intention of expediting both in the Government yards and the contractors' yards the completion of the various ships already voted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01679"><member>SIR FORTESCUE FLANNERY <memberconstituency>(Yorkshire, Shipley)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he could not agree with the lion. Member for Devonport in his somewhat ungenerous attack upon the hon. Gentleman who introduced the Estimates.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01680"><member>MR. KEARLEY</member><membercontribution> interrupted the hon. Member, and was understood to deny that he had made an attack.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01681"><member>SIR FORTESCUE FLANNERY</member><membercontribution> said it appeared to him to be a somewhat ungenerous attack. Ho ventured to say that the statement which the hon. Gentleman made to the Committee would commend itself generally to them. It would not be in order to discuss the whole sphere of naval policy on these Estimates, but he thought ho might remark that the greater part of the million and a quarter which was asked for had been spent on coal. The note of explanation suggested that the expenditure was for the purpose of replenishing the stock of coal at certain places, and, if rumour were correct, that
<col>476</col>
replenishment had not taken place a moment too soon. They had heard rumours of one of the ships of the Mediterranean Squadron towing another ship in consequence of the deficient quantity of coal and the difficulties of replenishment. He did not know if these rumours were correct, but if they were, the state of affairs showed a want of foresight on the part of the Admiralty as regards the provision of coal. They wore now apparently performing the duty of replenishing the stocks wherever necessary. The Vote for coal expenditure appeared to be &#x00A3;607,000, and if the Admiralty would make the stocks sufficient throughout the Mediterranean and elsewhere, they would make one of the best possible preparations for naval operations. The 6OO men referred to in the Votes were only nominally added to the Navy. They were only nominally transferred from the Colonial Navy to the Imperial Navy, and he was glad that reference had been made that night to the patriotic services of the Australians, because the country had been going into patriotic fervour over the services which the colonials had rendered on land. Notwithstanding the somewhat unkind remarks which had fallen from the hon. Member opposite with regard to the subsidy, he ventured to say that the country at large would welcome the services which the colonies had given and were still giving to the naval as well as the military forces of the country. The most salient point was the fact that the Committee wore asked to vote &#x00A3;207,000 more for contract expenditure. If there was one duty which the Admiralty had been neglecting more than another in the past, it was the duty of pushing on with naval construction. They had had explanations from the late First Lord of the Admiralty, whose loss to that House and the Admiralty they all deplored, of the causes of the arrears in naval construction. Year after year the House voted money, and year after year it had been spent without any reasonable excuse whatever. Now they found the Admiralty waking up to a sense of their duty, for they had actually expended more than had been voted. He said, as one who took the deepest interest in these matters, let them go on
<image src="S4V0090P0I0356"/>
<col>477</col>
with Supplementary Estimates for expenditure on new construction beyond that which had been voted by the House. They had not made sufficient naval preparations. The country understood that upon the Navy alone the security of the country from invasion depended. Without anticipating what might be in the Naval Estimates shortly to be introduced, he ventured to say that the House and the country were amply prepared for a considerable increase in the naval expenditure. [A Nationalist Member: No, no.] He referred to those who had the good of the country at heart, and not those who desired to see His Majesty's ships at the bottom of the sea. He well remembered the right hon. Baronet the Member for Forest of Dean made a speech in the House eleven or twelve years ago in which he called attention to the fact, which was then imperfectly recognised, that we were a hated nation. On that occasion the noble Lord the Member for Ealing moved that the naval preparations were insufficient. His right hon. friend suggested that the standard should be set up that the Navy of Great Britain should be equal to the navies of any two Powers that could be brought against it. If that was considered a sufficient standard then, was it a sufficient standard now? He asked those who had knowledge of the naval preparations in Europe, and a knowledge of the hatred with which we were regarded by many European nations, whether that was so or not? [Nationalist cheers.] Hon. Members opposite cheered because they recognised that his statement was true. If it was true, was it not wise that they should make preparation for any attacks that might possibly result from that feeling? Since that time what had happened? In Germany enormous naval preparations had been made, and millions of money had been voted. Germany, which was not then a naval Power at all, had since become and still intended to become a naval Power of the first rank. The United States of America had established already, and were extending, a navy. Japan at that time had only the beginning of a navy. To-day she had one of the most powerful in the world. He asked whether in
<col>478</col>
these circumstances it was not of the utmost importance that the standard of comparison as regards the Navy should be raised. He ventured to say that naval opinion and the opinion of all those who had thought on this subject had led them to the conclusion that the standard ought to be in comparison with any three Powers that might be brought against it. [AN HON. MEMBER: Six Powers&#x0021;] No, he was content with three. All he wanted was fair preparation. He hoped this discussion would at least have the effect of encouraging the Admiralty in the belief that the people of the country and the House in particular were prepared to endorse every reasonable proposal the Admiralty might bring forward for the naval defence, and therefore the safety, of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01682"><member>*SIR CHARLES DILKE</member><membercontribution> said he did not imagine they would be in order in following the last speaker in the discussion of the naval standard proper for this country. That was a matter which, of course, must be discussed on the first Vote of the Navy Estimates. On the present occasion they had to confine themselves to the Supplementary Estimate now before the Committee. The last speaker, and also his hon. friend the Member for Devonport, both dealt in much the same way with the retardation of the naval programme, and although his hon. friend opposite criticised the words with which the hon. Member for Devonport opened his speech, he nevertheless used even stronger language with regard to the total inadequacy of the statements which were made last year to explain the retardation of the programme. His hon. friend the Member for Devonport had given credit to the Government for showing some signs in this Supplementary Estimate of a desire to overcome the retardation which had recently taken place. They had no facts before them to show how the money was to be expended. The hon. and gallant Member the Civil Lord, in making his statement that night&#x2014;and he made it with conspicuous ability&#x2014; told them what the expenditure in the dockyards was, but the contracts item, except for coal, had not been explained to the House. He ventured to throw an
<image src="S4V0090P0I0357"/>
<col>479</col>
interrogation across the House, and he had since had a private reply that it was for armour on the contract ships. He asked what contract ships were to be pushed forward in this way, because the delays had been extraordinary, even as compared with those they were led to anticipate in the debates last year. The Civil Lord took credit to the Admiralty, and congratulated the country on the fact that four launches were to take place at once. In addition to the one battleship which the hon. Member for Devonport described, there were a number of private contract ships which had been delayed to an extraordinary extent. His hon. friend opposite would admit that the reasons given last year by Mr. Goschen for that delay were altogether inapplicable in the circumstances. The "Albion" was in the programme of 1896, she was launched in 1898, but was not yet in commission, while there were three Japanese battleships larger than the "Albion," which were begun after that ship, which were first announced by the Japanese Government long after the programme in which the "Albion" was announced, all built in England, and all of which were in commission at the present time. These Japanese ships received their armour and guns from English sources. Two of them were in commission in the Ear East, and the other was about to proceed thither. These were tangible facts. They could not be disputed. He mentioned also the "Formidable" and the "Irresistible," both of which were in the 1897 programme, and launched in 1898, and neither of which was yet in commission. The "Implacable" and the "Vengeance" were in the 1897 programme, and launched in 1899, but not yet ready. The "London" had been more delayed than all the others. He asked specifically with regard to these ships what was the cause of the delay compared with the more rapid completion of ships for foreign Governments in the shipbuilding yards of this country? Mr. Goschen impressed upon the House the necessity for four new armoured cruisers as part of the 1897 programme. When would these cruisers &#x2014; "Cressy," "Hogue," "Aboukir," "Sutlej"&#x2014;be ready for service? The delay in the completion
<col>480</col>
of the ships he had spoken of had been greater than was anticipated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01683"><member>*SIR JOHN COLOMB <memberconstituency>(Great Yarmouth)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> associated himself entirely with what had been said by the hon. Member for Devonport and the right hon. Baronet the Member for Forest of Dean, He trusted that the Admiralty would realise that there was a strong feeling throughout the country that we could not complete ships within the time specified for their completion or a reasonable time at all. The Admiralty should be able to fulfil its requirements with regard to certain ships within the necessary time in relation to the production of foreign nations. Unless the Government were prepared, when the Navy Estimates were introduced, to take the House and the country into their confidence, explain the causes of delays in the completion of ships, and satisfy the House that they had taken measures to remove those causes, they would fail in their duty. No party ties would induce any supporter of the Government to vote for them if the Admiralty showed they were not alive to the consequences of delays, and took no steps to remedy them. His hon. friend the Member for the Shipley Division had stated that the British Navy should be equal to any three others that might be brought against it. He had always protested against these rule of thumb standards. The real test of naval strength was not a matter merely of counting ships. It was necessary to take many other things into consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01684"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: I am conscious that the short time I have served the country at the Admiralty does not enable me to deal as the House would wish with the grave questions that have been raised. Although it is only right and proper that the questions which have been raised should be discussed, I think hon. Members will realise that within a very few days a statement will be made on the main Estimates by the Financial Secretary. I think the Committee will share the view that it would be more fitting for me to answer briefly, as far as I can, the questions which have been put to me, and to leave the general question of the efficiency of the Navy to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0358"/>
<col>481</col>
be dealt with, as it will be more properly, on the main Naval Estimates. Let me say a word or two with regard to the delay in construction. I think I may claim that the fact of there being a supplementary estimate for about &#x00A3;300,000 for money spent more than was anticipated a year ago is a proof that we have made some advance. It should never be lost sight of that in regard to this question of construction our main difficulties began with the great engineering strike, and we have never really reached the point of rapidity at which we then stood. Another point is that in regard to the time in which a ship can be constructed the governing factor is the machinery. The time of launching is, after all, only an incident, and it is not a fair statement to say that because one ship is launched in eight months, another in seven, and another in seventeen months, and yet are all commissioned about the same time, it shows a varying practice and a varying amount of supervision on the part of the Admiralty. The time of launching is not an indication of the state of progress in the construction of a ship. When a ship is launched largely depends upon whether the slip is immediately required for laying down another ship. The Admiralty fully recognise the justice of the criticisms which have been delivered with regard to the delays in shipbuilding, and there is as keen a desire and as firm an intention on their part as have been expressed by hon. Members here to do everything in their power to accelerate the progress of construction and to turn out the ships within the least possible time. The measures which will be taken to that end will more properly be put before the Committee by the Financial Secretary, and unless any further specific questions are put to me I would leave the general question there.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01685"><member>MR. BARTLEY <memberconstituency>(Islington, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: You have not explained why Japanese boats can be built so much more rapidly than our own.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01686"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: Well, I think it is perhaps hardly fair to take one or two particular ships. The Japanese have not ordered so many ships in England as we have. We have a very large
<col>482</col>
number under construction, and perhaps it is not difficult to take out our slowest and show that the Japanese have been turned out more rapidly. We have many contractors at work, and it is impossible that all the contracts can be executed within the time. We have no doubt been unfortunate in the delay of some of our contracts. I do not wish to be taken as complaining of the criticisms of the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Forest of Dean. The Japanese ships were turned out quickly, but we have had ships turned out quickly also. The particular ships mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman certainly were rather backward. With regard to the question of repairs, I was asked whether I could name the actual ships on which the extra expenditure had been incurred and the amounts. I can do so. It is a long list, but the ships mentioned by the hon. Member for Gateshead, namely, the "Burmese," the "Europa," and the "Powerful," are not in it. The total extra amount incurred was &#x00A3;34,000, in amounts varying from &#x00A3;1,000 to &#x00A3;3,000 per ship. In regard to the individual ships upon which the extra contract sum was spent, I regret I can make no further statement at present other than that it was almost all for armour, which was delivered for various contract ships under construction in different parts. The Admiralty officials are at the present moment unable to specify upon which particular ships the amounts were incurred, but it is sufficient, I think, that the general programme of shipbuilding has been advanced. The point second in importance raised to-night has been, I think, the question of coal contracts and the increase in price. The hon. Member for Gateshead has vigorously attacked the Admiralty on that matter, and he told us that commercial firms were in the habit of making the contracts beforehand.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01688"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: But we have heard complaints from all the great railway companies, and engineering and ironwork firms, that the high price of coal has reduced their dividends and made it almost impossible for them to carry on
<image src="S4V0090P0I0359"/>
<col>483</col>
their businesses. I have not heard of a single great firm throughout the country whose business involves any large expenditure on coal which has not had to incur increased expenditure and pay reduced dividends in consequence of the increased price of coal. The Admiralty wish to be placed on the same footing as a business firm. As business firms have had to go to their shareholders and complain that their expenses have increased and their dividends diminished, so the Admiralty have to come to the Committee and say they have spent more money than they expected to do. The only difference between the Admiralty and a business firm is that the latter is at liberty to make contracts when it likes. If a director of a company, from information received, was able to inform his colleagues that coal would shortly go up in price and remain at that increased price for fifteen months, that company would be able to make contracts, if anybody would enter into them, to cover those fifteen months. But the Admiralty have to come to Parliament for a vote, and a great deal would be said by hon. Members if the Admiralty were to enter into huge contracts for coal three months before the money was voted by Parliament. Then we are told that instead of buying coal at 13s., when we might have done, we preferred to buy at 29s. In that matter we are in exactly the same position as a business firm. We provide for our foreseen requirements at what appears to us to be the best price. But when unforeseen demands arise we have to make the best arrangements we can. I must apologise for not having stated this in my original statement. The whole of this increase in regard to coal is not on account of the rise in price. Practically one half is due to that factor, but the other half is due to the increased quantity that had to be bought in consequence of the trouble in China. That is the point upon which I am at issue with the hon. Member for Gateshead. He says we might have bought last October twelvemonth all the coal we required to see us through the China trouble, which did not break out until eleven months later.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01694"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: A firm that is carried on on business lines has ordinary annual requirements, and it makes its contracts on the lines of the quantities required in the ordinary way of business for the year. But if an entirely unforeseen occurrence takes place halfway through the year, and there is a large demand for coal, that firm, will have to buy at the then price. That is exactly the position in which the Admiralty found themselves when the China trouble broke out. They were brought face to face with the question, Are we to buy coal which is necessary for the service of the country, not only for the supply of the Navy during this crisis, but also, as is essential when such a trouble occurs, to increase the stocks at our foreign stations, which it might be difficult to do after war had broken out? Could we hesitate for one moment in answering such a question, even if the price of coal was as high as 29a a ton? In regard to the victualling, a question was asked incidentally as to when the Report of the Committee might be expected. In answer to that I would say that the Committee are now considering their Report, but as it has not yet been presented it is impossible for me to say when it will be laid before the House. The hon. Member for Wokingham asked a question as to piloting. There is no question whatever of there being any less efficiency on the part of naval officers so far as their qualifications for piloting are concerned. This sum is almost entirely due to extra canal dues on vessels going through the Suez Canal on their way to China. The hon. Member for Gateshead asked what was the sum per month we are paying for the ss. "Ophir," and great fault was found because the word "hire" instead of "charter" was used. It is a charter, of course. The "Ophir" is a vessel of 6,910 tons. She is perhaps one of the most suitable vessels existing at present
<image src="S4V0090P0I0360"/>
<col>485</col>
for the services for which she has been chartered. The sum we are paying is &#x00A3;1 per ton per month.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01695"><member>MR. WILLIAM ALLAN</member><membercontribution>: Then you are paying &#x00A3;6,910 per month?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01696"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: We are paying &#x00A3;1 per ton per month, and the tonnage is 6,910. She will be manned with a crew from the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, with the exception of the engine-room staff, stewards, and cooks, who are being provided by the owners. The fitting of the ship has been carried out by the owners. I think I have now answered all questions of general importance which have been put to mo, and I must ask the indulgence of the Committee for any deficiences on my part. Nothing will more encourage the Admiralty in their endeavour to carry on this work to the satisfaction of the House and the country than to see that the House takes a real interest in the matter. I do not think the benches have always been very well filled during the discussions on the Navy Estimates, but the Admiralty certainly have no wish to slur the matters through without discussion, It is through what transpires here that we shall feel we have the support of the House, and through the House the support of the country, in using every endeavour to accelerate the progress of construction and to make the Navy, not on paper, but in actual fact, one of which the country may be proud, and which will be able to discharge its duties in the manner in which they have always been discharged up to the present.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman the Civil Lord on his appearance in this debate, and I am sure the great ability he has exhibited augurs well for the successful management of Admiralty affairs in this House. But I confess I am not quite satisfied with one or two of his replies. With regard to the delay in building our battleships. I was much surprised when he said that it was quite a usual thing, after a ship was launched, for her to have to wait at least six months for her machinery.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01698"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: I did not state that.</membercontribution></p>
<col>486</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01699"><member>SIR JAMES JOICEY</member><membercontribution>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will explain, but that was my impression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01700"><member>*MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: I think the hon. Member for Devonport said that.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01701"><member>Sir JAMES JOICEY</member><membercontribution>: If that be the case I am at a loss to understand why Japanese vessels&#x2014;some of which were built on the Tyne&#x2014;have been delivered so much more quickly than those intended for His Majesty's Government. When a vessel is arranged to be built it is provided that the machinery has to be put on board as soon as she is ready for it after launching, and I do not understand why there should be this delay in connection with His Majesty's ships. I believe that contracts could easily be made with any of the largest shipbuilding firms to deliver any class of vessel the Government might require within two years. These delays are a great disappointment, but I have been told by contractors that the great difficulty they have to contend with is, that the Admiralty inspectors go down to the yards, presumably to inspect the building&#x2014; which is a very proper thing to do&#x2014;but the contractors say that after they have received the designs and plans little or big alterations are continually being made, and these alterations are the means of seriously delaying the work and considerably adding to the cost. The result is, that many of the best shipbuilding firms refuse to contract with the Admiralty, because, as they say, they do not know what the contract means. When they take a contract from a private firm they know exactly what they have to do, but in dealing with His Majesty's Government they never know what the inspectors will expect them to do, and often after the work has been done in a manner satisfactory to any reasonable person, they have to pull it to pieces and do it over again. I hope His Majesty's Government will take more care in making their contracts and fixing their data, because, as a practical man who has had some experience of these matters, I feel that these delays are unnecessary and could be avoided. The hon. Member said that the fact that they were spending more money proved that they were pressing things forward more rapidly,
<image src="S4V0090P0I0361"/>
<col>487</col>
and almost in the same breath he stated that the reason of the delay in delivering the vessels was the engineering strike. Everybody who has had anything to do with shipbuilding during the engineering strike knows that instead of increasing the cost it considerably decreased the expenditure in a particular year, because if the ships were not delivered a very much smaller sum had to be paid, so that the one argument is practically destructive of the other. Another question with which the hon. Gentleman did not deal satisfactorily was with regard to the "Ophir." I understand that something like &#x00A3;400,000 was fixed as the expenditure upon the Royal yacht in the last Estimates. There must have been at least &#x00A3;100,000 or &#x00A3;150,000 expended in connection with that vessel, and why does it not appear in this Estimate? I presume we shall see it when the general Estimates are presented; therefore I shall not press that question now. I was glad to hear the reply to the hon. Member for Wokingham. I was not startled that there should be a considerable sum for pilotage. There are cases when it is better to have a skilled pilot, one who knows the particular port or the coast-line of the particular district to which a large battleship has to go, rather than take the risk of running such a vessel, costing &#x00A3;1,000,000 or &#x00A3;1,500,000, ashore. It is a, common practice with ordinary shipowners, when a ship goes to a port with which the captain is not very familiar, to employ skilled pilots, and I think the Government should do the same. When the sea is so rough that the skilled pilot is unable to get out to the ship, the owner, of course, has to rely upon the captain's own guidance in the matter. The Government would be well advised to give expert assistance to some commanders of our naval vessels if they thought it advisable to have it, but, naturally, in time of war they would have to rely upon themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01702"><member>*SIR JOHN COLOMB</member><membercontribution> asked, in reference to his hon. friend's statement that all the ship's complement for the "Ophir," with the exception of the engineering staff, was to be furnished by the Royal Navy, and that the engineers would be furnished by the owners,

<p id="S4V0090P0-01704"><member>SIR JOHN COLOMB</member><membercontribution> said that then there would have to be another Vote. He also wished to know whether all the men would be Navy Reserve men, and also how discipline was to be maintained, as part of the crew would belong to the Royal Navy and part be under the Merchant Shipping Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01705"><member>MR. E. J. C. MORTON <memberconstituency>(Dovonport)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he recognised that there was not now time to deal with several questions relating to the men in the naval dockyards, in which he was interested, and therefore he would postpone them until another occasion. After the courteous and able way in which the Civil Lord of the Admiralty had treated the Vote he did not wish to add to his difficulties. There was one question, however, which he should like to put to the hon. and gallant Gentleman. As late as last August Mr. Goschen appointed a Committee to inquire into the question of water-tube boilers. That was an extremely intricate question from the point of view of persons who were not experts. A rumour had found its way into the press that the Committee was about to make an interim Report shortly. Ho wished to know whether that was a fact, and also whether the Report would deal with the question as to the distinction between the Belleville boilers and other forms of water-tube boilers They all understood the difference between water-tube and fire-tube boilers, both as regarded advantages and disadvantages, but he for one did not understand the difference between one form of water-tube boiler and another.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01711"><member>MR. DILLON</member><membercontribution> said he had listened to the debate for a long time, and every hon. Member who had spoken had spoken in encouragement of the Admiralty in their wild career of extravagance. That was a most lamentable condition of things, and it appeared to him that it was time that the voice of economy should be heard, and that, after the eloquence to which the Committee bad been treated by experts anxious to see more millions expended, someone should speak on behalf of the taxpayer, who would have to find the money. He proposed to move the reduction of the Vote by &#x00A3;1,000.000. They were now called upon to give a supplementary sum of &#x00A3;1.250.000 towards the Naval Estimates for the current year. That was not only a Supplementary Estimate, but it was a Supplementary Estimate in addition to what had been described as an additional Estimate. Of course they knew to their cost that during a time of war they were called upon to vote Supplementary Estimates for the Army or the Navy, as the case might be, but the war in South Africa had no effect on the Navy, and the Navy had not been called upon for any unusual exertions. Therefore they might treat the Navy as being on a peace footing. But, besides the sum now ask d for, they were called upon in Lily last to vote what was described as an additional Estimate of &#x00A3;1,269,000. Therefore the whole additional Supplementary Estimate asked for the Navy dining the current year was over &#x00A3;2,500,000. If hon. Members would look at the history of the British Navy they would find nothing to equal such a condition of things as that. The First Lord of the Admiralty, in making his Naval statement for 1900&#x2013;1, announced that the total Estimate for that
<col>490</col>
year was &#x00A3;27,522,600, an increase of &#x00A3;928,100 over the Estimate for 1899&#x2013;1900. They were now called upon to make a further increase of over two and a half millions, or, in other words, the cost of the Navy for the present year, without any additional expense attributable to the war or to warlike preparations, was three and a half millions over the cost of the previous year.<lb/>
That was only the beginning of the story. The Committee had listened to the speech of the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite, who gave expression to the sentiments held by the patriotic gentlemen who constituted the Navy League, and who were continually clamouring for increased armaments. He declared that what was wanted was a large and continuous increase in the cost of the Navy, and therefore the Committee bad the pleasant prospect of having to consider a still further increase next year. He asked himself where that policy was going to stop. Some years ago an hon. Member announced the proposition that the British Navy should he kept always equal to the navies of the next two greatest Powers in the world. The effect of that was, as he and other hon. Members ventured to prophesy at the time, that the navies of the two great Powers specified were enormously increased, and the argument used in Russia and France in support of the increases was the very statement made in the House of Commons that the British intended to be masters of the sea. Tonight an hon. Gentlemen announced that the standard, as he called it, for the future should be that the British Navy should be kept up to a point of equality with the navies of any three other Powers. He ventured to describe that as a career of madness. When Mr. Gladstone retired from public life they were led to believe, and he for his part did believe it, that one of the motives which induced him to retire at that particular moment was that his own friends insisted upon a substantial increase of the Navy, and Mr. Gladstone, with his immense experience, dating from the early years of the century and from the days of Sir Robert Peel, was convinced that if he consented to that increase, it would be impossible to tell where such a, policy would end. What had happened? When the Naval Estimates were introduced in 1895 the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0363"/>
<col>491</col>
then Civil Lord of the Admiralty said that ten years previously the total Naval Estimates were just over twelve millions, and that they were then asking for eighteen millions for that year, it was that increase which contributed to the retirement of Mr. Gladstone from public life. They had now reached a figure of over thirty millions, or an increase of twelve millions within the last five years. Those were figures which ought to make the Committee pause and reflect on the course they were asked to pursue. As Mr. Gladstone prophesied in 1895 would be the case, the increase then voted was a geometrical increase, and increased more rapidly in every succeeding year. During the debates on the Navy Estimates in the last few years there had never been a hint or a sign that they were reaching the limit.<lb/>
Some hon. Members appeared to be under the delusion that England had such boundless resources that she could arrogantly take up the position of standing against the world in arms, and that she could hold the seas against the world. Such language was the language of madness, and would inevitably lead to the national ruin. If hon. Members continued to talk such preposterous language, and if they could get their views carried into effect, it could lead to nothing but national ruin. They could not bold the seas against the world in arms, and what had happened during the last few years had shown that such boasts were weak and foolish. They had encouraged the United States in a mad career of building a- fleet and engaging in what was called an Imperial policy. He believed that the people and the statesmen of England would bitterly rue the day in which they excited and encouraged the United States. If the United States were to take up that wild idea of naval armament it would put England to the pin of her collar to hold her own. Then there were the Japanese fleet and the German fleet, which formerly amounted to almost nothing, but which, largely owing to the boasts and insults of England, had been doubled and quadrupled during the last few years. It was absurd for England to attempt to maintain that world-wide supremacy of the seas which she maintained for many years. If England sought to be mistress of the seas, then he
<col>492</col>
prophesied that the day was not far distant when the British taxpayer would be crushed under a burden which he was no longer able to bear. He and other hon. Members had in recent years fought doggedly against increases in the Navy and in the Army, though he confessed he never thought expenditure would increase at such a rate as would satisfy hon. Gentlemen on the opposite side, who were continually clamouring for money, and whose appetite grew on what it led on. The more money that was voted the more they wanted. A gentleman, describing himself as Chairman of the Navy League, made a prophecy in <i>The Times</i> newspaper in December last which had been borne out in a most remarkable manner. He denounced Mr. Goschen, and stated he had been for a long time incapable of mastering the difficulties which confronted him at the Admiralty. He pointed out how the universal antipathy of the German people had found expression in the doubling of their fleet, and he said that the conclusion was irresistible that the management of marine affairs during the five years of the late Government had been incompetent, with the result that England had lost command of the seas. It was the opinion of the Chairman of the Navy League that, after twelve millions had been added to the expense of the British Navy, the result was that England had lost command of the seas. That was nice encouragement for the taxpayer. <i>The Times</i> newspaper, commenting on that conclusion, spoke of the Navy League as possessing an energetic policy, but it seemed to him as if it were suffering from the malady known as "political hysterics." Unless the Admiralty took the man who shouted the loudest, and made him their head, they would not satisfy the Navy League. Instead of applying themselves to remedy the evils and defects which experts were continually pointing out, the Admiralty seemed to have set themselves the impossible task of satisfying the cry of the Navy League for more money without any regard as to how it should be spent. They could not satisfy the Navy League, and they were now pursuing a, career which, if continued much further, must end in absolute bankruptcy or a revolt on the part of the taxpayers. There was
<image src="S4V0090P0I0364"/>
<col>493</col>
no assurance that the money was to be spent in such a way as that value would be had for it. No hon. Gentleman had spoken in stronger terms on the subject than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. He delivered a speech about a year ago in Bristol, in which he defended the Government from the attacks of the Navy League. He said that the year before his Government came into office the expenditure of the Navy was fifteen millions, and that they had raised that expenditure in five years to twenty-five millions. The Chancellor of the Exchequer regarded twenty-five millions as a great achievement, but now they were asked to vote thirty millions, and with every prospect of a still higher figure being demanded. He therefore, would take, that opportunity of protesting against the increased expenditure now proposed.<lb/>
There was one item in the Supplementary Estimate&#x2014;namely. &#x00A3;30,000, for the seizure and detention of vessels on the South African coast&#x2014;to which he wished to refer. The Civil Lord of the Admiralty did not give an explanation of that, and he thought it very hard that the taxpayers should be called upon to pay &#x00A3;30,000 for proceedings which were a flagrant breach of the usages of war. He should like to know what reprimand had been addressed to the officers for the seizure of vessels engaged iii carrying food to Lorenzo Marques. He begged to move the reduction of the Vote by one million.<lb/>
Motion made, and Question proposed, "That an additional sum, not exceeding &#x00A3;250,000, be granted for the said Services."&#x2014; (<i>Mr. Dillon.</i>)</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01712"><member>MR CREAN <memberconstituency>(Cork. S.E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he desired to support the reduction. It was not necessary for him to add anything to what had been stated by his hon. friend, but he wished particularly to bring before the Committee the treatment meted out to Ireland in connection with naval expenditure, He had the honour of representing a Division in which a shipbuilding yard was located, which, however, for many years had been boycotted. The men had either to walk the streets idle, or cross over to England to seek employment. The Civil Lord of
<col>494</col>
the Admiralty stated that the cause of the delay in executing shipbuilding work was that the shipyards were not able to cope with it. There were many shipyards which had not had a pound's worth of work from the Admiralty, and they would get it were it not that the Admiralty had pet yards. Why should the work be confined to the pet yards of the Admiralty? Even if other yards got work, the inspectors were on the pounce, and watched carefully every man working on a boiler or fitting a plate on the vessel, He would not complain if that course were also carried out in other dockyards, but it was not. In the yards to which he was referring the work contracted for had not only to be completed, but every whim of every official had also to be carried out. That was the reason why some of the best yards in Ireland&#x2014; which were some of the best in the world &#x2014; would not take Navy contracts. Why were not Navy contracts taken, in Belfast? He objected on that ground to the Supplementary Estimates. He believed that 50 per cent, of the Estimate was dishonest, though, of course, he did not accuse the lion. Gentleman opposite of doing anything dishonest or dishonourable. What he intended to convey was that proper supervision was not exercised over the work executed in the pet yards of the Admiralty. In, his own constituency they dreaded to take a contract from the Navy, not that they could not turn out the work well, because they had been already complimented by the Admiralty. He asked for no favours, but that his constituents should get the common right of taxpayers who were contributing to the present extraordinary expense. They at least might be allowed to compete with English firms on equal terms.<lb/>
The action of the Admiralty in asking for such a large Estimate was not surprising, because hon. Members connected with the Navy League were prepared to encourage them in their extravagance. The Admiralty were encouraged not to economise, and they were given to understand that they would get what they wished to ask for. The Irish Members protested against such conduct, He was very glad that the reduction had been moved, and he would vote for it. He pitied England if her boast that she
<image src="S4V0090P0I0365"/>
<col>495</col>
would meet the world in arms was as poor as her boast about her Army. If England could do with her Navy only what she had been able to do with her Army, it would not be much. The other day he read of ships in the Navy, supposed to be fitted to undertake any emergency, which had to be docked for repairs, He believed that nine-tenths of the ships in the British Navy were in the same condition, and were not in any sense as well equipped as the ships of the mercantile marine. The British mercantile marine was the best in the world, but he doubted very much if the British Navy would be capable of meeting the navies of any two other Powers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01713"><member>THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: I do not think it is open to discuss the general condition of the Navy on this Vote.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01714"><member>MR. GREAN</member><membercontribution> said it was the efficiency of the Navy they were discussing, and his point was that the money was wasted because it was not efficiently expended. If they were to judge the efficiency of the Navy by the efficiency of the Army they would have to remodel their naval system completely, not only with regard to supervision of extravagant expenditure, but also as regards construction. At present vessels were not built in accordance with the original design, and no actual Estimate could therefore be framed for them. When a contractor got it into his head that the work was not to be completed according to specification, and that the design might be changed a hundred times over, he did not mind, because it put extra money into his pocket. The hon. Baronet who spoke recently stated that a commercial firm wishing to build a steamship entered into a contract which was carried out to the letter, and in accordance with the designs, and the result was that the ship was built for the price originally fixed. Ships for the Navy were never contracted for on proper lines, and were never built within 25 per cent, of the original estimate. The result was that extravagant expenditure was called for every year, and that extravagant Supplementary Estimates were brought, forward without any details being given. Even the present Estimates were not final, because the Civil Lord of the Admiralty said that there would have to
<col>496</col>
be another Estimate for the engineering staff of the "Ophir." He had great pleasure in supporting the reduction moved by his hon. friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01715"><member>MR. JOYCE</member><membercontribution> said he desired to make a few remarks on some of the sub-heads of the Supplementary Estimates. He entirely agreed with what the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite said with regard to the sub-heads dealing with the wages, provisions and clothing of seamen. He would not object to any money spent in making the seamen more comfortable, but those sub-heads were very small indeed, whereas the amounts under other sub-heads had been enormously increased. After the very able and lucid speech of the hon. Member for Gateshead, he would merely content himself with recording his protest against the enormously increased expenditure of &#x00A3;700,000 for coal. He thought the hon. Member had proved his case with regard to that, and although the Civil Lord of the Admiralty made a very nice and a very pretty speech he did not answer it. Then there was a sub-head for piloting His Majesty's ships. The hon. Gentleman said that, as a matter of fact, the large amount of money mentioned in the sub-head was not all for piloting. If it were paid for canal dues or otherwise, it should be placed in its proper position. He ventured to submit that piloting did not cost a fifth of the money.</membercontribution></p>

Many Parliaments had been known by peculiar names. He had read of the Long Parliament, and the Short Parliament, and the Rump Parliament. Now they had the Parliament of Telegraphic Communications. In every Estimate that was brought before the Committee the amount of money that was expended on telegraphic communications was simply enormous. He thought his hon. friend the Member for East Mayo was acting in the interests of the taxpayers when he moved to reduce the Vote, and he would support him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01718"><member>MR. FLAVIN <memberconstituency>(Kerry, N.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that the hon. and gallant Gentleman oppo-

site, in his friendly criticism of the proposals of the Government, stated that in connection with the Navy, England was not exceeding the expenditure of other European countries, and was simply following their lead. From a recent Parliamentary Return, it would, however, appear that His Majesty s Navy had been increasing, was and would continue to increase, and that England was leading other countries in naval expenditure. Was the Committee justified in voting the huge amount of money spent on the Navy? Were the condition of the Navy bad, were its ships in such a rotten condition that they would not he seaworthy, then they might be justified in incurring I reasonable expenditure, but the question they had to consider was whether the present expenditure was reasonable or just, and whether it was in proportion to revenue, and in proportion to the naval expenditure of other countries. He would quote for the information of the Committee a few figures from the Parliamentary Return to which he had referred. It would appear from that Return that the naval expenditure of the United Kingdom in 1897&#x2013;8 was twenty-two millions out of a total revenue of 108 millions, or twenty percent. He should like to know if I here were any European countries that had such a large naval expenditure as compared with its aggregate revenue. The information he had led him to believe that there was no such country. In Russia the naval expediture was only six millions as compared with an aggregate revenue of 147 millions, or only four per cent. In Germany the naval expenditure was six millions, as compared with seventy millions of revenue. With reference to France, many Englishmen appeared much afraid of that country, and seemed to think that her naval, power was not second to that of England, although that was a question of trial between the two nations. And he believed that the day was not tar off when the issue would be fought out. [An HON. MEMBER laughed.] hon. Gentlemen might laugh, but they knew down in the bottom of their hearts that for the last two years naval experts had been declaring that the British Navy was bad. Two years ago an hon. Member who stated that the British Army could

not take away the freedom of a farming community in South Africa would not be listened to, but he would be listened to now. What did he find as regards the naval expenditure of France? It was only nine millions as compared with a revenue of 102 millions. He found that the naval expenditure of Great Britain was in one year equal to that of France. German) and Russia combined.<lb/>
The question which hon. Members from Ireland had to consider was not whether these sums were necessary for the purpose of protecting the Empire, because they were not there to protect the Empire. They came there with the courage of their convictions, and told lion. Members what they thought about them. They came to demand justice for Ireland, and they knew that ever since the Union the contributions of Ireland had always been excessive. According to a Royal Commission appointed by hon. Members opposite&#x2014;a jury empannelled by themselves&#x2014;a verdict of guilty was brought home to them. It was the bounden duty of hon. Members from Ireland to protest against the increased expenditure in connection with the Army and Navy. The present revised Estimate in connection with the Navy was &#x00A3;30.419,000. He had shown, according to the Parliamentary Return for 1897&#x2013;8. that the naval expenditure was then only twenty-two millions. The Irish Members wanted to know who was getting value for that greatly increased expenditure. Ireland received no benefit from it, directly or indirectly. Their shipbuilding yards were idle, and the British Government would not even give a gunboat to protect Irish fisheries which were at the mercy of the foreigner. Ireland had to pay part of this increased taxation not only in money, hut even in blood shed in South Africa. The Irish Members protested against the war when it began, and told the Government what the consequences would be. Irish Members now told the Government unhesitatingly that if through some foreign complication England came into conflict with her neighbour across the Channel, the British Navy would be as inferior to the French navy as the British Army was to the Boer army. [Laughter.] Hon. Gentlemen might laugh, but the Irish Mem-

<col>499</col>
bers told them the same about the Army. He believed that if the issue had to be fought out in the morning. France would show a superiority over the British Navy. There were very large questions affecting Ireland which arose out of the Vote before the Committee, because Ireland had to contribute a sum of more than &#x00A3;3,000,000 a year beyond her just proportion. What did Ireland get in return? The Irish Members had endeavoured to elicit information in regard to contracts for the Navy and Army. The Government was generous enough</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01760">Order of the Day for resuming the debate on the present system of military administration at the War Office, read.</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01761">Debate resumed:&#x2014;</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01762"><member>*THE EARL OF NORTHBROOK</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think your Lordships will agree with me that our thanks are due to the noble Duke for bringing this question before the House. No question can be more important than that of the Regulations under which the Army is administered, and I am sure no one can complain of the manner in which the noble Duke introduced the subject to your Lordships. I congratulate the noble and gallant Lord opposite&#x2014;the Under Secretary for War&#x2014;who replied to him, upon the very effective way in which he showed the knowledge which he has obtained of the Department during the very short time he has been at the War Office.<lb/>
With regard to the speech of the noble and gallant Viscount the late Comman-
<col>512</col>
der-in-Chief, I venture to express the opinion that, holding as Viscount Wolseley does that the Regulations under which the Army is now administered are bad and should be altered, it was the noble and gallant Viscount's duty, as a Member of your Lordships' House, to express that opinion on the termination of his service as Commander-in-Chief of the Army. I do not think it would have been possible for any man to have expressed that opinion in more courteous terms, with more studied moderation, or with more entire absence of any personal allusion to the late Secretary of State for War. Before coming to the question which has been brought forward by the noble and gallant Viscount, I must allude for a few minutes to the latter part of the speech of the noble Marquess the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs last night. I am bound to say that the noble Marquess appeared to me to have gone out of his way, without any excuse that I could discover, to make a personal attack upon the noble Viscount. What on earth the noble Viscount's advice to the Secretary of State on the subject of the South African War can have to do with the question whether the Order in Council for the administration of the Army is a right or a wrong one passes my comprehension. I have been some time in politics, but I have no recollection of any instance having occurred where a Minister of the Crown has come down to Parliament, without notice given and without any assignable ground, and related confidential communications which have passed between himself and one of the officers with whom he was associated upon subjects connected with the public service. If this practice is to be continued I entertain grave apprehensions as to its effects. We may have the head of one of these departments coming to Parliament and saying, "My military or my naval adviser said so and so." Or we may have the military or naval adviser saying in Parliament, "I gave such and such advice to the Secretary of State, but he did not take it." And if he is not in Parliament you may have him writing to the newspapers on the subject. I consider that the course taken by the noble Marquess was exceedingly ill-advised. It is impossible for your Lord-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0374"/>
<col>513</col>
ships to express an opinion upon the statements of the noble Marquess, because we have not the Papers before us. The noble Marquess read a part of a confidential Memorandum written by the noble Viscount, and, in answer to a question I put to him, promised to produce that document and lay it on the Table of your Lordships' House. I hope that when the noble Marquess does lay that Paper on the Table he will explain all the circumstances under which it was written. The noble Marquess having taken the course of relating his view of certain advice given by Lord Wolseley, it will be perfectly justifiable for Lord Wolseley, if he thinks it desirable to do so, to move for all the Papers connected with that advice, so that the whole of the circumstances shall be before us.<lb/>
The attack made by the noble Marquess upon Lord Wolseley has, however, nothing whatever to do with the question before your Lordships. The question is, Is the Order in Council of 1895 a good order or a bad one? Is it one which enables the Commander-in-Chief to occupy his proper position in the War Office? Is it a businesslike and practical Order in Council? Lord Wolseley's opinion, after five years experience of this Order, is that it is not; the noble Marquess thinks it is. For my part, I think it is much more likely that the noble Viscount, with his long experience of the Army and of the War Office, is right than that the noble Marquess is right. However that may be, let us see what this Order really is. A statement is given of the duties of the different departments of the War Office&#x2014;the department of the Commander-in-Chief, the department of the Adjutant General, the department of the Quartermaster General, the department of the Inspector General of Fortifications, and the department of the Director General of Ordnance. The Order in Council makes the heads of each of these great departments of the War Office responsible to the Secretary of State for the conduct of the business of their respective departments. That is the substance of the Order. But over and above this there is a kind of order that the Commander-in-Chief shall exercise a general supervision, and be the principal adviser of the Secretary of State
<col>514</col>
upon all military questions. The question which the noble and gallant Viscount asked was, How can the responsibility of these different officers to the Secretary of State harmonise with the general supervision of the Commander-in-Chief? It seems to me an impossibility. What does general supervision mean? The noble Marquess did not define it. The Under Secretary for War drew a distinction between general supervision and control; but I want to know who is responsible for these different departments. Is the Commander-in-Chief responsible, or are the heads of the respective departments responsible? The noble Marquess stated, in the course of his speech last night, that&#x2014;
<quote>"If the noble Viscount the late Commander-in-Chief had paid more attention to the duties assigned to him by the Order in Council, he might have enabled us to turn to better account the large number of Auxiliary forces that we have in this country, and which I am constrained to say have been not a little neglected during the last live years."</quote>
Here is a Minister who has just left the Office of Secretary of State for War asserting in this House that he has neglected the Auxiliary forces of the country. He was the responsible Minister. Why has ho neglected them, and why, having done so, does he put the responsibility on the noble and gallant Viscount the late Commander-in-Chief? If you turn to the Order in Council your Lordships will see that the duty of dealing with these forces is not put under the department of the Commander-in-Chief, but under that of the Adjutant Generals who is responsible to the noble Marquess. How the noble Marquess can try to throw a slur on the late Commander-in-Chief for having neglected the Auxiliary forces, when he has put the duty of looking after those forces under a department responsible to the Secretary of State and not to the Commander-in-Chief, passes my comprehension. This shows how impossible it is to put responsibility on anyone in respect of this Order in Council. If the noble Marquess misinterprets his own Older, and says that the Commander-in-Chief is responsible for the Auxiliary forces, then I really do not quite know how we stand.<lb/>
The noble and gallant Viscount said he found that this general power of super-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0375"/>
<col>515</col>
vision, which he could or could not exercise over the different departments, the heads of which were responsible not to him but to the Secretary of State, rendered his duties almost impossible; and it was only, he said, owing to the ability and public spirit of the officers at the War Office who were responsible for sending out supplies and troops that we had not been placed in a considerably worse position than we have been in regard to the war in South Africa. I well believe that. I have always borne testimony to the way in which those officers have worked, and the noble Marquess himself deserves his share of the credit in the matter. But that does not prove the organisation, of the War Office to be right. The Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General perform functions which are essentially connected with the office of Commander-in-Chief. The duties of looking after discipline, training, instruction, and military education are most important, yet your Lord-ships will see that they are, under the Order in Council, separated from the office of Commander-in-Chief and given to another officer. Is it possible that an Army can be managed in that way? How is it possible for the Commander-in-Chief to exercise his duties properly if this most important work is taken out of his hands and given to another officer whom he may, if he pleases, generally supervise, whatever that means, but who is responsible to the Secretary of State and may communicate with the Secretary of State without the knowledge of the Commander-in-Chief whenever it suits him to do so? I say it is an impossible system. The noble Marquess has filled the same office as I had the honour to occupy in India. Does ho suppose for one moment that you could have such an organisation in connection with the Indian Army, the Commander-in-Chief exercising a general supervision over the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General, but both of those officers being responsible to the Viceroy for their particular departments? It is a plan which seems to me to carry on the face of it the stamp of failure, and it is to the credit of the officials in the War Office that it has lasted so well up to now.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said that this was the recommendation of the Hartington
<col>516</col>
Commission, and he paid a very right and proper compliment to the common sense of the noble Duke and his able colleagues; but he did not say that the Commissioners did not agree between themselves. I deny that the Order in Council of 1895, to which the noble and gallant Viscount objects, was recommended by the Hartington Commission. The noble Marquess has no right whatever to bring forward the Report of the Commission in support of his Order. The Report of that Commission, as a matter of fact, recommended the abolition of the office of Commander-in-Chief altogether, and the substitution of a Chief of the Staff with certain other heads of departments responsible to the Secretary of State. I do not say that is a light plan, but it is certainly a workable plan.<lb/>
The real point is whether the duties connected with the discipline and training of the Army should or should not be separated from the office of Commander-in-Chief. The Hartington, Commission recommended that the duties of ensuring uniformity in the discipline, training, and education of the Army at home and abroad, promotions, appointments, selections for command, and so on, should be entrusted to one officer and not to two, as has been done by the Order in Council of the noble Marquess. Therefore I think the noble Marquess has no right whatever to fall back upon the Report of the Commission over which the noble Duke presided in support of his Order in Council of 1895. The noble Marquess, again, attacked in an extraordinary way &#x2014;I do not know why&#x2014;the Order in Council passed by one of his predecessors &#x2014;Mr. Stanhope&#x2014;in 1888; but in doing so ho must have forgotten that he had sitting by his side the noble Marquess the Prime. Minister, who, if I am not mistaken, was Prime Minister when Mr. Stanhope was Secretary of State, and was therefore equally responsible with Mr. Stanhope for the Order which the noble Marquess the Foreign Secretary so violently attacked. I think that Order did place too much work on the Commander-in-Chief, but I am by no means certain that it was as bad as the noble Marquess has described it to be.<lb/>
There is no evidence in the Report of the Hartington Commission which gives the noble Marquess the right to say that the system which existed
<image src="S4V0090P0I0376"/>
<col>517</col>
from 1888 to 1895 was "discreditable and disastrous." If that is so, why was it allowed to remain unaltered for seven years? It may be said that it was not desirable to make any change until after the retirement of H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge. I think that would be a mere excuse. I had the honour of being in communication with His Royal Highness on many matters connected with the Army. I was in communication with the illustrious Duke in 1870, when the great alterations were made in the Army; and I am satisfied that His Royal Highness would have been perfectly ready to join in any alteration of the Order in Council and in the duties of the Commander-in-Chief which he thought of advantage to the public service.<lb/>
I do not see why certain modifications could not be made in the Order of Council of 1895 which would put the administration of the War Office on a sound footing. If the Government simply put the Adjutant General and Quartermaster General's work under the Commander-in-Chief the thing would be done. The other departments might remain in the hands of their respective heads, who should be responsible to the Secretary of State. But we should see that all matters connected with the discipline and training of the Army are put under the Commander-in-Chief. There should be no longer any question of general supervision, which cannot be defined and which prevents proper responsibility being put upon anyone. These matters are not very abstruse; they really lie almost in a nutshell. Anyone who reads this Order can see its defects, and it seems to me not altogether out of the question that His Majesty's Government may be able to put this matter straight. I trust that the effect of this discussion will be to remove the anomalies which have been clearly pointed out by the noble and gallant Viscount, and which have been most inadequately replied to by the noble Marquess the late Secretary for War.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01763"><member>*LORD CHELMSFORD</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, the noble Earl has so completely answered all that has been said by the noble Marquess the Secretary of State for
<col>518</col>
Foreign Affairs that I have but very little to say. But being one of the oldest military officers in your Lordships' House, I feel that I cannot remain silent when such an important question is being discussed. I confess that I heard with the greatest surprise, and, I may say, with indignation&#x2014;I am afraid to use a stronger term&#x2014; the attack which was made yesterday on the noble and gallant Viscount by the noble Marquess. The noble and gallant Viscount began by deprecating the introduction of personalities. He was most impersonal in his speech, and yet the noble Marquess, in spite of that, chose to make charges against him which he knew perfectly well the noble and gallant Viscount could not answer, and in language that certainly does not redound to his credit.<lb/>
The noble Marquess made a great point of the important duties which under the Order in Council still devolve upon the Commander-in-Chief, but he did not say that the questions of drill, discipline, and the efficiency of the Army are taken out of his hands, and that he is only allowed to retain a sort of general supervision. I will quote short paragraphs from the duties of the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General and leave it to your Lordships to consider what there remains to the Commander-in-Chief to do.
<quote>"The Adjutant General shall be charged with the discipline, military education and training of the officers, warrant officers, noncommissioned officers and men of the Regular and Reserve Forces and the Militia of the United Kingdom."</quote>
Other duties are set out, and the concluding words are&#x2014;
<quote>"He shall advise the Secretary of State on all questions connected with the duties of his department."</quote>
Where, I ask, comes in the Commander-in-Chief to interfere with or supervise or control the Adjutant General? The Adjutant General is absolutely independent of the Commander-in-Chief, and it depends upon his good will whether or not he consults the Commander-in-Chief on questions of discipline and drill.<lb/>
Then I come to the Quartermaster General. He also has very important duties to perform, for which the Com-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0377"/>
<col>519</col>
mander-in-Chief was always held responsible personally previous to the Order in Council of 1895. The Quartermaster General is charged with supplying the Army with food, forage, and light, with land and water transport, and with remounts, and also with the distribution of the troops. He has also to deal with sanitary questions relating to the Army. All these matters are taken out of the hands of the Commander-in-Chief. The Quartermaster General is absolutely independent of him and need not consult him on any one of those important points. The Order in Council provides that the Quartermaster General shall submit the proposals of the annual estimates for these services, not in consultation with the Commander-in-Chief, but independent of him, to the Secretary of State for War, and shall advise the Secretary of State on all questions connected with the duties of the Department. Of what use, is the word "supervision" if the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General chose not to be loyal to the Commander-in-Chief? Then I come to the Director General of Ordnance. He also has to advise the Secretary of State upon questions relating to patents, inventions and designs.<lb/>
It is a farce, therefore, to say that under an Order in Council of that sort the Commander-in-Chief is left with any power at all. He is, in fact, made absolutely subordinate, in the command of the Army, to the Adjutant General, to the Quartermaster General, and to the Director General of Ordnance, for these officials need not, except at their own free will and by a feeling of loyalty, consult the Commander-in-Chief on matters relating to their departments. I trust that under the change of administration which has taken place in the War Office the whole of the Order in Council will be repealed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01764"><member>*THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I should like to say how much I concur in that which fell from the noble Earl as to the inconvenience likely to arise if attacks such as that made on the noble and gallant Viscount by the noble Marquess the late Secretary of State for War are to become the fashion in Parliament. There can be no question, I think,
<col>520</col>
as the noble Earl has observed, that the noble and gallant Viscount would be justified, if he thought it necessary to vindicate his character, in asking for all t the Papers connected with the opinions that he has given to be laid upon the Table of the House. I doubt very much if that would be a convenient precedent to set. But I would like to point out that two very distinct charges were brought by my noble friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs against the noble and gallant Viscount on the cross benches.<lb/>
The noble Marquess said that if the noble and gallant Viscount had paid more attention to that part of the Regulations which requires him to prepare schemes for offensive and defensive operations he would, perhaps, have told the Secretary of State before the South African War that Ladysmith was not a suitable station for Her Majesty's forces to occupy. I do not profess to have any particular knowledge of the general strategy pursued in South Africa, but I have always understood that the main principle was a central advance across the Orange River into what was the Orange Free State, and thence into the Transvaal, and the fact that we had a large force shut up in Ladysmith, and the necessity for relieving that force, interfered seriously with the general scheme of campaign; in fact, that the operation which was subsequently so brilliantly and successfully carried out by the present Commander-in-Chief was the original and main principle of the campaign, but had to be deferred on account of the necessity for relieving Ladysmith. If that be so, the noble Marquess has practically told the House that it was owing to some neglect of duty on the part of the noble and gallant Viscount, the then Commander-in-Chief, that the war has been unnecessarily prolonged, and that many of the disasters we have had to deplore occurred.<lb/>
The noble Marquess also said that, if the noble and gallant Viscount had paid rather more attention to his duties, he might have warned the Government that it would take more than one army corps to subjugate the two South African Republics. That, again, is a most serious allegation. But, my Lords, I should like to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0378"/>
<col>521</col>
know, was the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief the only opinion that was taken at the time? Had the Defence Committee of the Cabinet nothing to say about the matter? Did not the despatches of General Butler make a reference to the need for 100.000 men?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01765"><member>*THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (the MARQUESS of LANSDOWNE)</member><membercontribution>: No, no. No such Paper is in existence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01766"><member>*THE EARL OF DUNRAYEN</member><membercontribution>: If no such thing was stated, then the general public have been for a long time under an erroneous impression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01767"><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: A very erroneous impression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01768"><member>*THE EARL OF DUNRAYEN</member><membercontribution>: I will not pursue that further. But is it to be understood that the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief as to the force required was the only opinion taken at the time, and that, if it had not been for the advice which the noble and gallant Viscount then gave, a larger and more adequate force would have been sent out to South Africa? Those are very serious charges&#x2014;they amount to charges&#x2014;to bring against the late Commander-in-Chief. I join sincerely with the noble Earl, Lord Northbrook, in deploring the fact that the debate has not been conducted on the lines which the noble and gallant Viscount laid down, and which he adhered to&#x2014;namely, that there should be no personalities and that the matter should be dealt with from a purely theoretical point of view.<lb/>
The noble Marquess laid great stress upon the Report of the Hartington Commission. The noble Earl has already alluded to that. But I should like to point out that out of nine members of the Commission six of them made separate memoranda or statements, and that they differed from each other on very material points. One member of that Commission&#x2014;a very eminent member&#x2014;the late. Lord Randolph Churchill, issued a very long and able Memorandum, and with your Lordships' permission I would make one or two quotations from it, so far as they are absolutely pertinent to the matter before the House. What Lord Randolph Churchill suggested was a Commander-in-Chief or Captain General of the Army, having, subject to the Government, supreme control over
<col>522</col>
and responsibility for the administration of the Army; and that military training, military experience, and military eminence should be the qualifications for that office. The very opposite of that is what has taken place. Lord Randolph Churchill, in another paragraph, said&#x2014;
<quote>"The object aimed at is the maximum of efficiency consistent with the amount of expenditure which the taxpayer or his representatives will tolerate. Can any practical amount of efficiency of administration be attained without professional training or knowledge? Can it be attained without direct personal responsibility? Can direct responsibility be reasonably expected without professional control? The answer to these questions, I submit, is obviously in the negative."</quote>
I think it is impossible in the few words I shall address to the House to make a stronger case against the present system, and when the noble Marquess justifies the present system as being the recommendation of the Hartington Commission. I think it well that your Lordships should bear in mind the fact that, at all events, the opinion of one very prominent and eminent member of that Commission was diametrically opposed to the system now in force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01769"><member>THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL (The DUKE of DEVONSHIRE)</member><membercontribution>: He signed the Report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01770"><member>*THE EARL OF DUNRAYEN</member><membercontribution>: The question really resolves itself into this: whether professional knowledge is requisite in the person who has supervision and presides over the various departments of the War Office. We heard a great deal last night about the efforts that have been made towards decentralisation; but I do not see that any decentralisation has been obtained. Centralisation remains exactly the same. Everything connected with what I may term the military side of the administration, and everything appertaining to the civilian side, is concentrated in the War Office. It is also centred upon one man. Formerly a great deal of it devolved on the Commander-in-Chief; now the whole of it is centred in the Secretary of State. Where does the decentralisation come in? The only difference is that formerly the work was to a great extent centred on the man having professional knowledge, supposed to be, and probably being, the was a Commander-in-Chief or Captain I first soldier in the Empire; whereas now General of the Army, having, subject to it is centred upon a man who, however the Government, supreme control over capable and able he may be, must of
<image src="S4V0090P0I0379"/>
<col>523</col>
necessity be absolutely ignorant of the work which he has to control.<lb/>
The departments of the War Office are not watertight compartments independent of each other. Nothing can occur in one of these departments that does not affect the Army as a whole; and surely in such a case there ought to be some co-ordinating brain, somebody whose duty it is to see that what is done in one department does not militate against the Army generally or the other departments. Formerly that duty was exercised by a professional expert, and now it is performed by the Secretary of State, who is not a professional expert. I feel sure that no private business could be conducted for a month successfully on the present system in the War Office. Imagine one of your Lordships being suddenly placed at the head of some great manufacturing undertaking. How would he conduct it? I should say, by acting with the advice of and through the expert general manager; certainly not by independently consulting and giving directions to the foremen of the various departments. Yet that is the system under which the War Office, which deals with such gigantic issues that the largest private undertaking bears no perceptible proportion to it, is managed at the present time. As it is, there is no responsibility whatever.<lb/>
Not very long ago in this House the noble Marquess, then Secretary of State for War, cited as an instance of the activity of the War Office the fact that he was collecting large reserves of stores, which in his opinion had not been sufficiently maintained for a long time. Just conceive if the professional head came and stated that he had known for a number of years that our military stores were deficient, and that he was going to set to work to supply the deficiency in the middle of a war, what would be said of him? And what can one say when the civilian Secretary of State makes such a statement? No man can expect that the civilian Secretary of State can be really responsible for technical matters of military detail. I remember some time ago the noble Earl who generally sits on the cross benches (Lord Wemyss), with his usual vivacity, saying somebody was responsible, and that that individual ought to be hung. Quite so; but who
<col>524</col>
is the individual? I should be exceedingly sorry if the Foreign Office was to be deprived of the services of the Secretary of State in such a summary manner; while it would be very unfair that the noble and gallant Viscount should meet with such a fate, because, as he has told us, the real responsibility of the Commander-in-Chief practically ceases when he has given his opinion&#x2014;that is to say, if he is asked for an opinion at all. Lord Randolph Churchill, in his memorandum on the Report of the Hartington Commission, used some very pertinent words on this question of responsibility. Speaking of the military chief, lie said&#x2014;
<quote>"Professional reputation to a soldier is everything next to life itself."</quote>
And alluding to the Secretary of State, he said that&#x2014;
<quote>"Administrative incapacity at the War Office brought little evil consequences to the individual nominally responsible. In the majority of cases he was simply transferred to some other office&#x2014;to a foreign Embassy, to a Colonial Governorship, or, at the very worst, to the House of Lords."</quote>
The noble Duke who introduced this question asked for information. We have not as yet had a great deal of information. After what fell from the Under Secretary of State for War and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, I suppose we must assume that His Majesty's Government are entirely satisfied with the working of the machinery of the War Office, and that in the main it is as perfect as is humanly possible. That was the gist of the speech of the noble Marquess.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01771"><member>*THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE</member><membercontribution>: On the contrary. I said that, after five years experience, I thought it very probable that in some respects the system introduced in 1895 required some modification.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01772"><member>*THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN</member><membercontribution>: Yes, in unimportant details, but I think, the noble Marquess will agree with me that he said the machinery worked fairly well, and that it would have worked a great deal better if the Commander-in-Chief had not in some respects neglected his duty and had given it a fair test. Under these circumstances we cannot look for any large reforms. I deeply regret that. In my opinion, you cannot have an efficient I army and a good military machine unless it is supervised and superintended
<image src="S4V0090P0I0380"/>
<col>525</col>
by a professional soldier. I quite agree that the Secretary of State must be in a sense the head of the War Office. He is responsible to Parliament, and must be the superior; but, as far as possible, if you want full value for the enormous sums the country is spending, you must have a professional man responsible for the training and efficiency of the Army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01773"><member>*EARL SPENCER</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I think I ought to say a few words on the remarkable debate entered upon last night and continued this evening. Your Lordships will all, I am sure, agree with me that we wish, as far as possible, to avoid the personal matters which have been brought into prominence. The noble Marquess went into those at the end of his speech in considerable detail. I quite admit that the noble Marquess was to a certain extent challenged by the noble and gallant Viscount, who, although he did not quote any personal matters, did attack the system, and the system cannot be divorced from the men who originated it and who conduct it. At the same time, I confess I agree with what Lord Northbrook said with regard to the length to which the noble Marquess went in illustrating his views. It seems somewhat a pity and misfortune to actually show the secrets of the War Office during a great crisis in this country. No doubt it is very interesting to the public generally to know these details, but in the interests of administration it is a misfortune that they should be brought forward, for, being brought forward once, they may be demanded another time.<lb/>
I noticed with pleasure that the noble and gallant Viscount admitted that there must be official responsibility on the Secretary of State, and I think I shall presently show that if the noble and gallant Viscount's views were carried out it would be extremely difficult that lull responsibility could be had. The noble Earl who has just spoken also said that the Secretary of State must be in some sense responsible, but the stress he laid on the position of the Commander-in-Chief almost obliterated and neutralised the force of his remarks about the responsibility of the Secretary of State. In the Report of Lord Hartington's Commission some remarkable opinions are quoted&#x2014;the opinion of the Duke of
<col>526</col>
Wellington that it was "much better that the Secretary of State for War should be the person to regulate that matter than that it should be in the hands of officials connected with the Army" and the opinion of Lord Hardinge that "in a constitutional point of view the Secretary of State for War is the proper person to draw up a Mutiny Bill and the' Articles of War. He is bound to stand between the civil subjects and the military."<lb/>
I should humbly associate myself with the opinions of those distinguished men. But let us see whether the position of the noble and gallant Viscount&#x2014;for whom I have the highest respect and admiration &#x2014;is compatible with those views. He instanced a case in which the Commander-in-Chief might differ from the Secretary of State, and he said that such an important fact ought not to be kept in the office, but ought to be made public, so that the country might decide who was right. I have also seen statements that the Commander-in-Chief and the First Naval Lord should publish at the beginning of every year an exact estimate of the number of men and the requirements needed for the Army and Navy. Having had the honour of being First Lord of the Admiralty, I will venture to say that it would be perfectly impossible to carry on the business of the country and to bring forward in a proper way before Parliament the demands of the Services if that principle were allowed. No Cabinet could submit to it, and it would lead to exaggerated demands on the part of the military and naval authorities, put forward in order to get, at all events, some part of them carried out. While saying this, I feel in the strongest possible way the necessity for getting the best expert advice for those civilians who occupy the responsible positions of the Secretary of State for War and the First Lord of the Admiralty. It is essential that they should have at hand the best military and naval opinion. It strikes me, in reading the Order in Council, that it lays this down most decidedly as the duty of the Commander-in-Chief to give advice to the Secretary of State, as the First Naval Lord gives advice to the First Lord of the Admiralty. I do not understand how my noble and gallant friend can go as far as he does
<image src="S4V0090P0I0381"/>
<col>527</col>
when he says that the present system has robbed the Commander-in-Chief of his chief usefulness, and has virtually handed the command of the Army to a civilian Secretary of State, assisted by subordinates with whom he deals direct. That is a very strong statement, and I cannot conceive how, under the Order in Council, it can be justified. It is the duty of the Commander-in-Chief to give his knowledge and experience to the Secretary of State, and if the Secretary of State does not ask for it, the Commander-in-Chief is bound, under the Order in Council, to offer it, and to leave the responsibility of refusing it to the Secretary of State.<lb/>
I know very well the importance of this subject. When I was at the Admiralty I had some very difficult questions to face: and I had to meet and face what my noble and gallant friend called the Cerberus at the Treasury. But when I was at the Admiralty, and also when I occupied another position, I found that whenever there was a great necessity actually proved, the Cerberus of the Treasury always gave way, and I always got what I wanted for the services of the country. I had the satisfaction, too, of working in harmony with my naval advisers. I mention this, because I know it may be said&#x2014;as it has been said in the public press&#x2014;that the power of the First Sea Lord was shown when I was at the Admiralty by a threat of resignation. I absolutely deny that during any time I was at the Admiralty I had a hint of resignation from any of my Naval Lords. It is most important for the Secretary of State or the First Lord of the Admiralty to keep on good terms with his expert advisers, and not to allow this extreme step of resignation to be resorted to. I have often rather smarted under the statement that when a certain statement was made in the House of Commons during my term of office it was withdrawn under a threat of resignation. It is absolutely untrue. I took full responsibility for putting that statement right, and my colleague in the House of Commons most honourably withdrew what I had shown him was wrong. I quite understand that it might he desirable&#x2014;and the noble Marquess said so last night&#x2014;to remodel some of these Orders in Council: but I am bound to say that, on the whole, I think the Orders in
<col>528</col>
Council could, with proper management by the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief, be worked efficiently for the Army to secure that which is so important&#x2014;the individual responsibility to Parliament of the Secretary of State without in the slightest degree impairing the authority of the Commander-in-Chief or the efficiency of the Army itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01774"><member>THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, after what was said by my noble friend the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs last night in reply to the noble Viscount, it is not necessary that I should enter in detail upon the elaborate indictment which was made against the present system of organisation of the War Office. I do not think that it is necessary for me to do more than to take some notice of the charges which have been brought against my noble friend for making a personal attack in reply to the noble Viscount. The noble Viscount has been applauded for confining himself in the statement which he made last night entirely to generalities, and for giving no instances in support of his criticisms of the Order in Council. That is exactly what I think we have to complain of in his speech. These general <i>a priori</i> criticisms are of very little value unless they are supported by some instances; and it would have been much more useful if the noble and gallant Viscount had told us in what respects the defects in his powers and responsibilities had in actual practice led to any of the failures which have taken place in the administration of the Army and in the conduct of the war.<lb/>
My noble friend did not follow the noble and gallant Viscount in this respect. He took a more practical and useful line in pointing out what he considered to be the entire misapprehension under which the noble Viscount suffers as to the powers and duties and functions of the Commander-in-Chief under the present system of organisation. He pointed out not only that that misapprehension appeared in the noble Viscount's speech, but that also in his tenure of office he had to some extent acted upon that misconception. Whether it was that the duties which are still left to the Commander-in-Chief are too onerous to enable him to devote his whole attention
<image src="S4V0090P0I0382"/>
<col>529</col>
to some of the most important parts of his duties, or whether lie laboured during his tenure of office under a misapprehension, which we believe was apparent throughout the whole of his speech, as to the scope, importance, and magnitude of these duties, my noble friend was bound to point out that in the conduct of these recent military operations we had not received from the noble Viscount all that assistance which the Order in Council made him, as Commander-in-Chief, responsible for giving to us. I do not see that there was anything in the nature of a personal attack on the noble Viscount. But undoubtedly my noble friend has given to him a challenge which it is perfectly competent for him to take up&#x2014;not, perhaps, in the course of this debate; but I am sure that the House will readily listen to him whenever he chooses to bring this matter before us again, to reply to that challenge, and to show that my noble friend's criticisms upon his conduct, and upon the advice which he tendered or did not tender to us were unfounded. That is all I need say as to that. The inquiry which has been suggested, which has been promised by the Government, into the conduct of the war and the operations in South Africa, and which I trust will take place when the war is concluded, will meet the case. All these matters must be fully gone into. Then I am sure that my noble and gallant friend the late Commander-in-Chief will enter into it and that he will be indebted to my noble friend rather than the reverse for having given him an opportunity of showing in what way he thinks that my noble friend has misapprehended or misunderstood his duties.<lb/>
I should like to say before I sit down a few words on a subject which has naturally been discussed in various quarters in this debate. I refer to the Report of the Commission which sat some few year ago, and over which I had the honour of presiding, and also the action taken on that Report. It certainly cannot be pretended that the recommendations of that Commission have failed. They have not failed, because these recommendations were not accepted in their entirety. There are, no doubt, good reasons why all these recommendations were not accepted in their entirety
<col>530</col>
either by the present or the late Government; but so far as they have been acted upon they have operated in the right direction. I think there can be little doubt of that, and so far as there has been any failure in military administration since the date of the Order in Council in 1895 it is due to the fact that those recommendations have not been adopted so completely as they might have been. It is quite true that the Report of that Commission, which, notwithstanding certain dissents upon various minor points, was signed unanimously by the whole of the Commission, did recommend the abolition of the office of Commander-in-Chief; and I may state how that conclusion was arrived at. We recognised that ultimately the supreme authority over the interests of the Army must be the Minister responsible for the Department; and the question was how that Minister could obtain&#x2014;how that Minister, who must be, as was admitted by everyone, the actually responsible head of the Army, could be supplied with&#x2014;the necessary expert advice, expert information with which it was necessary he should be furnished. My Lords, we found that this advice and administrative assistance was supplied under the Order in Council of 1888 nominally by the Commander-in-Chief. We came to the conclusion that the duties under that Order were so vast, exacting, extensive, and onerous that it was absolutely impossible that that responsibility, either for the giving advice or for the administrative conduct of the Army, should be a reality. We therefore proposed to divide the functions of the Commander-in-Chief and bring in military experts. We recognised that the duty of advising the Secretary for War upon important questions of military policy was the first and most important of the functions, and that it should be entrusted, as it is entrusted over every country in Europe, to an officer to be called Chief of the Staff. We proposed, further, to entrust recruiting, discipline, and the training of the Army to an officer whom, for want of a better name, we called the Adjutant General, and we proposed that the actual command of the troops in Great Britain should devolve on another officer to be called the General Officer Commanding the Forces in Great Britain.
<image src="S4V0090P0I0383"/>
<col>531</col>
The care of transport and fortifications, the charge of artillery, and the manufacture of ordnance we proposed should be placed under other military officers who should be severally responsible to the Secretary of State for War.<lb/>
As I have already stated, my Lords, those recommendations were not accepted in their entirety, for reasons some of which were good and others, I think, less sound; but those suggestions did not commend themselves generally to the opinion of the public. Some military men thought they were too revolutionary, and that they tended to impair the prerogative of the Sovereign as head of the Army. We gave reasons in the Report why we thought that was not a well-founded argument, but undoubtedly the officers of the Army had become so accustomed to the institution of Commander-in-Chief that there would probably be great apprehension, a want of confidence, and great dissatisfaction if the office of Commander-in-Chief was nominally abolished. The recommendation to establish a Chief of the Staff did not commend itself to others, on the ground that it was inexpedient to establish such a total separation between the consultative and administrative and executive functions. The late Secretary of State for War, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, recorded his view in a somewhat remarkable statement. He said&#x2014;
<quote>"It is true that in Continental countries there exists such a department as is here described. But those countries differ fundamentally from Great Britain in the constitution of their army and of its government, as well as in the purposes for which it is maintained. They are constantly and necessarily concerned in watching the military condition of their neighbours, in detecting points of weakness and strength, and in planning possible operations in possible wars against them. But in this country there is no room for 'general military policy' in this larger and more ambitious sense of the phrase. We have no designs against our European neighbours. Indian 'military policy' will be settled in India itself, and not in Pall Mall. In any of the smaller troubles into which we may be drawn by the interests of some of our dependencies the plan of campaign must be governed by the particular circumstances, and could be left, I presume and hope, to be determined by the officer appointed to direct operations."</quote>
And he added&#x2014;
<quote>"These difficult questions will be far better dealt with, and sounder advice regarding them
<col>532</col>
will be tendered to the Minister, by the experienced soldiers who are engaged day by day in the active administration of the Army than by an officer or body of officers, however able and distinguished, who sit apart and cogitate on the subject."</quote>
In the light of recent events, I think your Lordships will hardly agree that there is no place in our military system for an officer whose duty it shall be to advise upon great military operations. Personally, I have never attached very great importance to the question on whom the duty of advising upon great military questions should be conferred, the Secretary of State or the Commander-in-Chief; but what I do attach very great importance to is that those duties which were described in the Report of the Commission should fall on someone with a due sense of responsibility. The Report stated that the Chief of the Staff should be made responsible for the following duties&#x2014;
<quote>"To advise the Secretary of State on all matters of general military policy, and all questions as to the strength, distribution, and mobilisation of your Majesty's land forces, and the relative importance of various services put forward by the heads of departments; to collect and co-ordinate all military information; to prepare and revise from time to time a general scheme for the military defence of the Empire, and to examine the Estimates with a view to ensure that they are framed in harmony with that scheme; to prepare plans of action in certain contingencies; to communicate directly with the First Lord of the Admiralty on all matters involving interdepartmental policy; to examine all correspondence with other departments of the State, and to conduct all correspondence with general officers commanding on questions of military policy; to lay before the Secretary of State an annual report stating clearly all the military requirements of the Empire."</quote>
Neither the late Government nor the present Government saw its way to the appointment of an officer with purely consultative duties. Those are the duties which have been assigned in the first place to the Commander-in-Chief; but in the lengthy statement of the noble and gallant Viscount he paid no attention whatever to the instructions charging him with those functions, and it appears to me that the noble and gallant Viscount entirely misapprehended the responsibilities which have been placed on him. We felt that it was absolutely impossible that these duties should be adequately performed by a man who was overburdened and overwhelmed
<image src="S4V0090P0I0384"/>
<col>533</col>
by the duty of superintending, and who had the personal responsibility for the charge of the innumerable departments which are concerned in the administration of the Army.<lb/>
It was not with the intention of lowering the status or diminishing the authority of the Commander-in-Chief that he was relieved of the responsibility of the direct superintendence of the various departments of the War Office, but mainly with the object of giving him the time and the opportunity to discharge those most important duties to which have referred. The noble and gallant Viscount said yesterday that he might be told that, in spite of the defects of administration which he pointed out, much in connection with the recent campaign had been done with great efficiency. A large force had been mobilised, provided with supplies, and despatched with creditable promptitude to South Africa. But my noble friend said that the result, which he admitted, was not due in any respect to the system under which it had been done, but solely to the individual exertions of the admirable and meritorious officers engaged. Surely that was a statement somewhat begging the question. If the work had been well done, it could not have been well done under a system which was absolutely faulty and defective. No individual exertion on the part of any man&#x2014;and we most cheerfully acknowledge those exertions were ably and willingly given&#x2014;could have secured that satisfaction if the system had been so radically wrong as the noble Viscount asks us to believe. The noble Viscount said there was no parallel for such a system as that which has been established by the late Order in Council. I do not know what foundation the noble Viscount has for that statement. I think he said that China was the only country whose military organisation at all resembled ours. I think it would be far more accurate to say that no parallel could be found in any civilised military organisaion for that which he regrets.<lb/>
Take the case of France. You will not find in France any official in the position of Commander-in-Chief charged with, responsibility for the whole of the administration of the army which the noble Viscount desires to see established.
<col>534</col>
You have in France a War Minister, who no doubt is, generally speaking, a soldier, but who need not be so. But, whether he is a soldier or not, you have under the War Minister no officer who stands in any way approaching the position of the Commander-in-Chief which the noble Viscount desires to re-establish In the military organisation of France, which I suppose the noble Viscount admits to be a great military nation, I defy him to point out any official who occupies the position which he would assign in our Army to the Commander-in-Chief. Take the case of Germany. You have there, no doubt, a Commander-in-Chief. Who is that Commander-in-Chief? He is the Emperor himself; and it cannot be alleged that the German Emperor, having the control and conduct, not of the army alone, but of every other department of the Government, stands in the position which the noble Viscount would desire to be occupied by the Commander-in-Chief. In Germany, under the Emperor, there is not one officer, but three officers of equal status and position, who jointly divide the responsibility for the administration of the army&#x2014;the War Minister-in-Chief, the General Staff and Military Captain, and the Chief of the General Staff. Those three are co-equal, and receive orders direct from the Emperor. They cannot issue orders to one another, and have no personal command over the troops. In addition to these three, between whom the administrative duties of the department are divided, there are a great number of corps commanders owing allegiance to no one except the Emperor himself. I therefore defy the noble Viscount to point to any system of military administration existing in Europe which in the slightest degree corresponds to that to which the noble Viscount invites this House to return.<lb/>
One word more. The noble Viscount used an analogy which is fundamentally at fault. He said this system which we have adopted was not the system adopted in India, in Ireland, or even in the command of a regiment. He said that the general officer commanding in Ireland or a general officer commanding a division or brigade here was given complete control over his own staff. That analogy is, in
<image src="S4V0090P0I0385"/>
<col>535</col>
my opinion, totally and fundamentally misleading. The duties of these officers differ not only in their magnitude compared with the administration of the whole Army, but altogether in their character. These officers of whom the noble Viscount was speaking are officers responsible solely for the command given to them; they have nothing to do with their food, their clothing, their equipment, their housing, or their arms. The Commander-in-Chief whom the noble Viscount wishes to see re-established would be responsible not only for the discipline and training of the Army, I but for all those other requisites which I have enumerated. Therefore I say there is no sort of analogy between the control which we rightly give to officers placed in these positions and the control which the noble Viscount desires to assume over every officer of the War Office concerned in the administration of the Army.<lb/>
I am far from saying that the present system is the only possible one, or is certainly and absolutely the best. My noble friend behind me (Lord Lansdowne) submitted that the experience of five years will probably show that modifications are required, and that there are different systems to which, if we thought fit, we might revert. It might be possible to divide the administration of the Army between a Commander-in-Chief solely responsible for training and discipline and another officer responsible for the supply and <i>materiel</i> of the Army. That is a system which has been tried in this country, and which, probably for sufficient reasons, has been given up. I do not say that certain modifications of that system might not possibly be found better than the system established mainly on the recommendations of the last Royal Commission. But of one thing I am quite certain: that it would be a fatal mistake to return to the system which was condemned unanimously by the late Royal Commission, and endeavour to overwhelm the unfortunate officer placed in the position of Commander-in-Chief with nominal supervision, control, and responsibility over a vast series of departments with the business of which it is absolutely impossible for him to grapple.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01775"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I have listened with the greatest interest
<col>536</col>
to this debate, for the inception of which I think we should be sincerely indebted to the noble Duke opposite. For my part, I shall make but few remarks, and endeavour to do what I think has not always been the case with other speakers &#x2014;confine myself to the point really at issue. We had last night from the noble Viscount on the cross benches what I impartially thought was a public-spirited effort to call attention, in tin-interests of the public, not in his own, to some defects which he had found in the practical working of the present Army system. I hoped that in reply to that we should have heard from the Secretary of State who is responsible for the last five years for the working of that system some arguments which would have countered those adduced by the noble Viscount in his exhaustive speech. In reply, I am sorry to say we had that lamentable and unseemly attack which I think every speaker except the noble Duke on the front bench has qualified with the severest censure&#x2014;the lamentable and unseemly attack on the personal advice and responsibility of the noble Viscount which, even had it been in place, had no reference whatever to the question at issue.<lb/>
What reference has it to the relations of the Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary of State whether the Commander-in-Chief thought Ladysmith a good place of arms or not? It was not a question whether the Commander-in-Chief was a good commander-in-chief or not&#x2014;that you may argue out at any time you may think convenient. The point was whether under the Order in Council of 1895 the relations of the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of State were so adjusted as to be a working arrangement; and to impugn, the judgment, ability, or industry of the Commander-in-Chief individually has nothing whatever to do with that. I regret very much to make that observation. If, however, the case as laid down by the noble Marquess could have been in any way made more disastrous to the interests of the public service at large it would have been by the suggestion of the noble Duke who has just sat down. He invited the noble Viscount to recriminate. He said we should be only too happy to hear what lie has to say in reply, or any charges he has to make.</membercontribution></p>

What I said was that it would be more satisfactory and useful, and that I hoped the late Commander-in-Chief would take the opportunity of giving instances of the actual inconvenience or failures which had been the result of the defective organisation of which he complained.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01777"><member>THE EARL OF ROSEBERY</member><membercontribution>: I am within the recollection of the House. The noble Duke may be mistaken in what he said, but he certainly invited the noble Viscount to recriminate. I am sorry I cannot accept that contradiction. But even if it be true, what a position would be occupied by this House, and by this Government, so far as it is responsible to this House, if it were to be turned into a cockpit where the ex-Secretary of State for War and the ex-Commander-in-Chief were to exhaust their personal differences in a personal discussion&#x0021; But, my Lords, I call on the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to testify himself, out of his own mouth, to the validity of the doctrine which I lay down. He spoke, I think, with admirable irony last night in congratulating the noble Viscount on having freed himself from his self-imposed muzzle. Last year we did not understand that the muzzle was entirely self-imposed. We were very anxious last year to obtain some expert opinion as to the proposals and policy of the noble Marquess, and the answer we got was that it would be indecent and improper if the Commander-in-Chief were to appear in this House and to appear in any way in conflict or at variance with the opinion of the civilian Secretary of State.<lb/>
My Lords, I think on that painful aspect of the question enough has been said, and I wish, with all my heart, that no cause had been given by the Government for saying anything on the subject. The real point at issue is not whether Lord Wolseley was a good Commander-in-Chief or not, or whether Lord Lansdowne was a good Secretary of State for War or not; it is whether the arrangements under the Order in Council of 1895 have worked well and are calculated to work well. And on that point, I confess I have heard a good many remarks, but very few which seemed to me to touch the point at issue. The only point of the
<col>538</col>
speech of the noble Duke the President of the Council for National Defence&#x2014;that fantastic body which we are always attempting to grasp, but which always evades us&#x2014;the only point which was really valuable was the light he threw on the evolution of the Commander-in-Chief. What did ho say? He read us out copious passages from his Report. He lingered over them with something of paternal pride; he said&#x2014;"After all, I got almost everybody to sign it," and he endeavoured to present a picture of concord in connection with that Report which. I am bound to say, is glaringly at variance with the facts, because, when the noble Marquess, in the exercise of his discretion, proposed to abolish the Commander-in-Chief, the other most leading member of the Commission at once responded with a proposal to abolish the Secretary of State for War. But what we really have ascertained from the incidental remarks of my noble friend the noble Duke was this, that he wanted to abolish the Commander-in-Chief. Well, if it be sound and wise, there can be no objection to that course. But he said, "On consideration, it appeared to the late Government and ourselves" &#x2014;why should he drag in the late Government to shelter behind them in such a matter as this?&#x2014;" it appeared to the late Government and ourselves that there was some disadvantage in abolishing nominally the office of Commander-in-Chief." And, therefore, what happened was this: the noble Duke, so far as we can gather from his own remarks, with a determination to abolish the office of Commander-in-Chief, kept it nominally in the hierarchical system; and it is from that origin and source, I believe, that all the mistakes and all the friction have arisen.<lb/>
We are asked by the official vindicators of the system, "What has the Commander-in-Chief to complain of?" The Under Secretary for War, whose manly and breezy speech we listened to with so much pleasure last night, presented an almost ideal picture&#x2014;a picture that might have been painted by Theocritus&#x2014;of the pleasures of the life of a Commander-in-Chief. "What has he to complain of? The communication with the Secretary of State is through my room, and I can testify that there is constant communication&#x2014;too much for my
<image src="S4V0090P0I0387"/>
<col>539</col>
personal comfort. What does he complain of? Every source of information is open to his investigation. Has he any views about discipline? I assure the House that no question affecting discipline is ever settled without consulting the Commander-in-Chief," and so forth. But he did not tell us, and no speaker on the Government side has told us, this: Is there any Commander-in-Chief in Europe, or even in China&#x2014;to go to the country which appears to fix the attention of the noble and gallant Viscount&#x2014;is there any Commander-in-Chief in the world to whom the training and the discipline of the army is not entrusted? Is there any independent speaker in this House who will get up and say that there is a Commander-in-Chief in the world to whom the training and discipline of the army is not entrusted? If it be so, I should like to know the character of that army and the quantum of success it has met with in the field.<lb/>
I venture to differ from what fell from the noble Earl on the front bench here. He read several citations which, I think, were intended to prove that the position of the Commander-in-Chief was an entirely desirable one, and that the relations of the Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary of State under the present warrant were such as they should be. He quoted one illustrious name, a name that will never be quoted in this country without veneration. He quoted the Duke of Wellington; and he said that the Duke of Wellington had said that these functions&#x2014;my noble friend forgot to say what the functions were&#x2014;could only be adequately discharged by the Secretary of State. Does my noble friend believe for one moment that the great Duke of Wellington would have accepted the office of Commander-in-Chief as it was held by the noble and gallant Viscount? If he does, he lives in a fool's paradise. There was no Secretary of State at all in the life of the Duke of Wellington. What he was referring to was the financial system of the War Office, which he said would be more properly dealt with by a Financial Secretary for War than by the Commander-in-Chief, who had no relation to that point. I believe the whole mischief of this business has arisen from one of the qualities of our political intellect&#x2014;which is, when you
<col>540</col>
find that a thing is not working well, to rush at once into the farthest opposite extreme. I do agree with what has fallen from the Minister, that under the scheme of 1888 there was too much centralisation in the position of the Commander-in-Chief. That, at any rate, might have been remedied. What does not seem to me to have been necessary is this: that, starting with that fundamental principle, the reformers, of whom my noble friend the noble Duke was the head, should have rushed to the other extreme and centralised everything in the Secretary of State for War, leaving the Commander-in-Chief as a pale shadow, competent and permitted, if he chose, to give advice on subjects at large.<lb/>
We have had one or two illustrations of what the position of the Commander-in-Chief is, and I think we must admit that under the system administered by the noble Marquess, and which, I suppose, was founded on the Commission of my noble friend the noble Duke, there has been an attempt to thrust the Commander-in-Chief altogether into the background and substitute the person of the Secretary of State. We had the incident of all the communications directed to commanding officers being sent not to the Commander-in-Chief, but to the Secretary of State. And I confess I find myself in cordial agreement with what has fallen from the noble Viscount upon that point. How is it possible for regimental officers to hold their Commander-in-Chief in that esteem in which he should be held if he is not allowed to send any communication to them except through the channel and person of the Secretary of State?<lb/>
I do not propose to trespass any longer upon your Lordships' time, because I feel that, as a layman having no experience of the War Office, I have no claim to your attention. But I have the deepest and strongest sense of the gravity of the question at issue. It is not a question of Lord Lansdowne or Lord Wolseley, or of this Government or that Government; it is a question of the businesslike working of our Administration. Now, you have centralised in the Secretary of State the administration of Army Estimates, which have mounted to eighty-eight millions sterling, and of an Army that approaches half a million
<image src="S4V0090P0I0388"/>
<col>541</col>
of men. You have never had such a situation in the history of Great Britain, and I think that in these changed circumstances it does behove the Government to examine once more the, system which they founded in 1895, and against which so stringent a series of accusations has been brought by the Commander-in-Chief who has had large experience of them. The noble Marquess last year constantly told us that we were to look to him, and that we must not look beyond him. Let me say frankly that I do not think that is possible. I do not think that in the present situation of the world the vital matters of the defence of the country, of its military organisation, of the administration of this enormous Army and this enormous sum, can be left solely to the personal responsibility of the Secretary of State. I fully admit that the proceeding recommended by the noble and gallant Viscount was a great flaw in his speech. It is quite impossible that when the Secretary of State and the Commander-in-Chief diner they should appeal to the public as to which is right. Where is the public? Who are the public? If you ask me to go into the street to-morrow and find the public I should have the greatest difficulty in doing so. I do not believe the noble Viscount himself has the faintest notion of what the public is. Is it the threepenny press, or the, penny press, or the halfpenny press? Is it the press at all? Is it Parliament? Where is it? I think when you come to analyse the word "public" you will see how fruitless is that suggestion. But, on the other hand, I do not believe it is possible to continue the hidebound system of absolute, secrecy and of personal responsibility of one individual as it exists at the present moment. I confess I find it very difficult to suggest a, remedy; and remedies of this kind should not be proposed by unofficial people or in an offhand manner.<lb/>
I look with the greatest confidence, honest confidence, from the indications he has given, to the Secretary of State's proposals, which he, is to make in so short a, time; and I would not venture to anticipate what they may be; but I hope they may be, drastic and go to the root of the evil. I believe, however, that in
<col>542</col>
the long run Parliament will insist on knowing more than it, knows now. I quite believe that it is impossible that, in the heat of debate and in the publicity of Parliament, there should be elaborate statements made, which would reveal all our strength or all our weakness to the, public eye. Even with regard to that there has been much exaggeration, because I venture to say that there is no intelligence department of any first-rate Power that does not know a hundred times more of our strength and of our weakness than the British Parliament itself. It is only we, Members of the British Parliament, who are compelled, like ostriches, to bury our heads in the sand. But I have never been able to understand, except on account of the extraordinary innate administrative conservatism of Parliament in this country, why it should not be possible for a Committee of Parliament to meet the Secretary of State and the officials of the War Office and of the Admiralty in secret&#x2014;for I admit, it must be secret&#x2014;to test to some extent by personal examination what is the real efficiency of our naval and military forces.<lb/>
I believe that unless you have some such system as that you will never have a real and a, safe guarantee that our forces are in the condition they should be. I know that it is urged, and I think the noble Viscount hinted at something of the kind&#x2014;I speak under correction&#x2014;that, some certificate might be given to the, Commander-in-Chief that all things were as they should be in regard to our forces and our stores. That, I think, would be a difficult matter. It would place the Secretary of State at the mercy of the Commander-in-Chief, and when their relations were of such a, harmonious character as those which appear to have existed dining the past five years I think it would only add to the difficulty of the situation. Moreover, I recollect the ease of a Government that was impugned on the very question of the sufficiency of stores, and which, having a certificate of sufficiency from the Commander-in-Chief, was overthrown that very night. Therefore, I do not think the question of a certificate from the Commander-in-Chief would adequately meet the matter. Whether my suggestion of a Committee such as obtains in other countries would
<image src="S4V0090P0I0389"/>
<col>543</col>
meet the point I do not know. I make it in good faith, and I suggest it for the consideration of His Majesty's Government; but I do most strongly feel, and I think the course of the debate has shown, that things at present are not working on a businesslike footing, and that the sooner they are put on such a footing the better it will be for the Government and the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01778"><member>THE PRIME MINISTER AND LORD PRIVY SEAL (The Marquess of SALISBURY)</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I am in the same position as the noble Earl who has just sat down in having no right from a professional or administrative experience to take part in this debate. Therefore I will only say a few words to correct a misapprehension into which I think the noble Earl fell with respect to the real character of the controversy between the noble and gallant Viscount and my noble friend. The gist of the noble Viscount's complaint was that his functions, offices, and attributes were insufficient. The answer to him was to read those functions, and at the same time to point out to him that we had always felt that he had shown that he did not fully appreciate the spirit and multiplicity of the duties and responsibilities with which he was entrusted. It was in reference to that circumstance that my noble friend behind me referred to one or two points on which he thought the noble Viscount had thrust aside matters which really belonged to him, and to which if he had given more adequate attention it would have beer better for the public service; but that there was any intention of making an attack on the noble and gallant Viscount I think nobody, except the noble Ear who has just sat down, seriously believes.<lb/>
My Lords, the difficulty of being plunged into technical and professional matters of this kind must be very keenly felt by any civilian Member of the Mouse who attempts to take part in the debate. To me it has always seemed very strange that things which appear evidently to the professional Member of very small importance appear to me to be of considerable importance On the other hand, things which they elevate into great magnitude do no strike the civilian mind as being of
<col>544</col>
the same importance. What is the dispute which, as far as we can see, is now raging between the <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> of 1888 and the <i>r&#x00E9;gime</i> of 1895? It is admitted on all hands that the Secretary of State must be supreme. On the other hand, it is admitted on all hands that the Commander-in-Chief must know everything, see every Paper, and be consulted in all matters of importance. The only difference is this: that under the <i>regime</i> of 1888 the Adjutant General, if lie has a scheme, takes it direct to the Commander-in-Chief, who sends it on to the Secretary of State; whereas under the <i>regime</i> of 1895 the Adjutant General goes first to the Secretary of State, who sends the proposal on to the Commander-in-Chief. I must say that I think this debate has very much exaggerated the importance of the issue, and that there must be something else, something behind, which can have induced such able and eminent men to devote their minds so exclusively to this one point; and I think we saw it in the conclusion of the speech of the noble and gallant Viscount.<lb/>
It is said of a certain class of correspondent that the important observation always comes at the end. I think that applies to the speech of the noble and gallant Viscount. He told us, not as one of the main points on which he was insisting, but as something which occurred to him at the end, and which ought to be mentioned before he sat down, what was his solution of any difficulties that might arise if the Commander-in-Chief and the Secretary of State were not of the same mind. I think he puzzled the House. He said we were to take the people into our confidence, and to tell the press what we thought, and then the question at issue was to be discussed openly. How you were to decide which party was to be victorious I do not know, but the result of the battle-royal was to determine the particular decision on which the Office was divided. I allude to to this because I think it is the matter which is really at the bottom of our difficulty. I do not think the disputants, especially if they are military disputants, have entirely realised that the Army is under Parliament, and that the Minister who controls the Army does it as one
<image src="S4V0090P0I0390"/>
<col>545</col>
who is responsible to Parliament and represents all the authority which Parliament possesses. Unless you keep that steadily in mind, no doubt you will see many anomalies in our military system and its relations to the civil power. But it is no use comparing your Army with the army of France or of America, or of Germany or of Russia. They all differ in that one point, that the Parliamentary system of governing the Army does not exist among them.<lb/>
We must accommodate ourselves to the present state of things. Everybody knows historically how it has grown up, and everybody knows that it is intertwined too closely with all the fibres of our Constitution to justify anyone who forms his projects and bases his reasoning on the supposition that this relation can be modified. At the end you must have an Army governed by Parliament, governed by a Minister who is responsible to Parliament, and in any difference of opinion, whatever it may be, the Commander-in-Chief must be the subordinate of the Secretary of State. He may not like that; military men may not like it, but there it is. It is one of the bed-rock circumstances of the situation, something from which you cannot depart; and von must devote your minds to making it work, as it has worked, in the main, hitherto very well, and take care that it produces in the future, as it has produced in the past, results which it would have been impossible to produce in any foreign country. I feel that this debate will be lost upon us unless we take care to guide ourselves by that chief and predominant principle. In speech after speech from military men, men who know the language and spirit of the War Office, it is easy to detect a desire that military problems shall only be solved by military men; but any attempt to take the opinion of the, expert above the opinion of the politician must, in view of all the circumstances of our Constitution, inevitably fail. It must not lie supposed that in such contests the expert must win. In all these discussions there is an evident and growing desire to shake free of this necessity. I thought I traced it even in the peroration of the noble Earl, although I am sure he is too good and constitutional a statesman to entertain any idea that the existing
<col>546</col>
system can be radically changed. That is where the shoe pinches&#x2014;that the men who know or who ought to know, namely, the experts, are not the men to decide the dispute in question; but the decision, if it accords with their view at all, must be brought about by the concession of the civilian and the politician.<lb/>
There is one point with regard to experts that is not sufficiently borne in mind. If the experts were a concentrated body always giving one opinion, no doubt their authority would be very overwhelming. But experts, as we know, often differ in opinion. I remember Sir George Cornewall Lewis laying it down in Parliament that if you could find a distinguished man, an expert in any field of thought, laying down a definite opinion you would always find another man equally eminent laying down an opinion in exactly the opposite direction, Therefore, to tell us that the expert should rule military controversies when they arise is not entirely to set at rest all the difficulties with which we are confronted; and even if the wish of some Members were gratified by putting the decisions of the Commander-in-Chief above those of the Secretary of State you would really only have removed your difficulty by one stage. Because who is the Commander-in-Chief? He may differ from other military men; he may be in profound sympathy with the Government of the day, or he may be the reverse of being in sympathy with the Government of the day&#x2014;and, considering the mode of his appointment and the circumstances under which he holds office, that is not an impossible contingency. I do not think, therefore, that the supremacy of the Commander-in-Chief of a military nation, even if it were possible to obtain it, would solve all the difficulties by which we are surrounded, and I feel very strongly that we should only lose our way if we attempted to reach a solution without regarding the traditions which our Constitution has handed down.<lb/>
I quite concur in hoping that the military minds which apply themselves to the reconstitution of these mysterious Orders in Council may remove any defects that may be found. Not entertaining myself that belief in the efficacy of the Orders in Council which evidently
<image src="S4V0090P0I0391"/>
<col>547</col>
penetrates many minds, I do not regard the result as being of vast importance. And if I may sit down with an observation which is such a platitude and such a truism that everybody will agree with it, but which yet seems to me to be in variably neglected, it is that the success of your military system, the victories you are to win, the results of all your efforts, are not obtained by any machine, however theoretically just, however carefully polished, but will be attained, and have been attained in every ago of history, simply by the strength and brilliancy and vigour of the men you employ.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01779"><member>VISCOUNT WOLSELEY</member><membercontribution>: Before the debate closes I am sure your Lordships will allow me to say a very few words of personal explanation in reference to the remarks made yesterday by the Foreign Secretary directly reflecting upon my conduct as Commander-in-Chief. I confess that I was surprised, as well as pained, at the personal tone which the Foreign Secretary gave to the debate. I hope that, in your Lordships' opinion at all events, this was not caused by any personal remarks made by me when expressing my disapproval of the Order in Council of 1805. I intended, as I said, to discuss the present Army system as a system, apart altogether from persons. I am not aware that I deviated from that line in any respect whatsoever. With regard to the reflection made upon me, I will only say that no documents or other evidence of any sort or kind, either to prove or disprove them, are at present in the possession of this House. The noble Marquess has promised to lay on the Table a memorandum by me upon which he commented very severely. I trust that, in justice to me, he will also lay on the Table a full statement of the circumstances under which that document was prepared, it will then be apparent that the memorandum was not. a statement voluntarily presented by me to the Prime Minister, as the House may have supposed, but an expression of my opinion drawn up in obedience to directions I received from the Prime, Minister himself, and which, as I considered only straightforward and right, I showed to my chief, the present Foreign Minister, before I forwarded it to the Prime Minister. I do not propose
<col>548</col>
now further to enter upon the strictures of the noble Marquess who spoke yester day, and who found fault with me so severely and so unaccountably at tin time. To do so would be foreign to tin subject now before the House. I only ask your Lordships to reserve your opinion and judgment, as it is probable that on a future occasion I may call attention to these allegations.</membercontribution></p>

<title>THE UNITED IRISH LEAGUE AND<lb/> CRIME IN IRELAND&#x2014;MURDER OF<lb/> HUGH THOMPSON.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01780"><member>*THE EARL OF DARTREY</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I rise to call attention to the murder of Hugh Thompson, near Enniskillen, in the month of March, 1900, and to ask His Majesty's Government if any person has been, or is likely to be, brought to trial for this crime. This murder is of a class only too well known in Ireland, hut in order that your Lordships may be acquainted with the facts, I will mention a few of the circumstances which led up to it. In June, 1898, the tenant of a small farm adjoining the village of Belcoo, about a dozen miles from Enniskillen, was evicted. Shortly afterwards a man who desired to take the farm entered into negotiations with the landlord, but when this became known considerable feeling was excited in the neighbourhood. In the beginning of November he received a threatening letter advising him to have nothing to do with the farm, and giving him the significant hint that there was plenty of powder and shot in Ireland. This letter purported to emanate from the Irish National Federation, but was not signed. The man, however, paid no attention to the letter, and took possession of the farm. In the following June a public meeting was held in the village of Belcoo it which he was denounced&#x2014;not by tame, but quite unmistakably&#x2014;by a speaker who, I believe, was a Member of Parliament. He was afterwards severely boycotted. Nobody would buy from him and nobody would sell to him, but le eventually succeeded in finding a man who did a few odd jobs for him, sold a few cattle for him, and so on. At the end of October two of his haystacks were found to be on fire. The alarm was given, but nobody from the village would attempt to extinguish the flames. Legal pro-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0392"/>
<col>549</col>
ceedings followed, and the county court judge awarded him &#x00A3;6O compensation. The decision was appealed against, and the case went to the Enniskillen assizes. It did not come on during the first sitting of the Court, and the tenant of the farm returned in the evening to Belcoo, accompanied by Hugh Thompson, who was his principal witness. From Belcoo Thompson started to walk home, a distance of three miles but was murdered within a mile or so of the village. The next day, when the case came on, the judge used the following language&#x2014;
<quote>"The boycotting took place at the instance of a body calling itself the United Irish League. How has it culminated? One of the witnesses in this case has been brutally, atrociously, and cowardly murdered on his way home."</quote>
Four months later, in his address to the grand jury at Cork, where another case of murder was coming before him, the judge alluded to this Enniskillen murder, and said&#x2014;
<quote>"At the last spring assizes I had a case before me in which a threatening letter to the tenant of an evicted farm was succeeded by a meeting of the United Irish League alongside the farm. Then came the burning of the tenant's hay, and finally, the night before I heard the claim for compensation, the principal witness was brutally murdered on his way home."</quote>
This crime is attributed by the judge to the influence of the United Irish League, which is, I believe, still flourishing amongst us, its usual methods of intimidation being emphasised by occasional outrage. People are asking themselves rather freely in Ireland how many more murders it will take before His Majesty's Government will see fit to suppress the United Irish League in the same way as its predecessors, the Land League and the National League, wore suppressed. I do not know that there is very much difference between them except in name. Unless something is done to put a stop to these outrages there will be an inducement to well-disposed persons to obey the laws of the United Irish League instead of the laws of the land.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01781"><member>THE EARL OF DENBIGH</member><membercontribution>: My Lords, I regret to say that the account which has been given by the noble Earl of the singularly brutal murder of this unfortunate man Thompson appears to be only too accurate. I also regret to say that
<col>550</col>
at the present moment there does not seem to be any further information upon which a charge could be preferred with success. Four men have been arrested and charged with the crime; two of them were shortly afterwards discharged, and the other two were remanded from time to time, but were ultimately discharged by the magistrates owing to the absence of sufficient evidence. I can assure the noble Earl that the police are doing their utmost to discover the perpetrators of this crime. Investigation is still being vigorously pursued, but there have been no recent developments calculated to bring the guilty party to justice.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01890"><member>MR. PRETYMAN</member><membercontribution>: It is true that two cadets and one of the instructors of the "Britannia" have recently died from complications following upon pneumonia, and on Sunday last there were sixteen cadets ill, two seriously. The cause of the large amount of pulmonary disease is the prevailing epidemic of influenza of a severe type. The hospital is by no means full. The cadets have been granted three weeks leave, and the ship will be thoroughly purified and disinfected while the cadets are away.</membercontribution></p>

GODDARD <memberconstituency>(Ipswich)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Secretary to the Treasury, as representing the Postmaster General, if he will state the practice of the Department in regard to near relatives holding appointments on the same staff; and whether it is customary for exceptions to be made; and, if so, for what reason.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01960"><member>MR. AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN</member><membercontribution>: The Department regards it as unsatisfactory that an officer should have to supervise members of his family, and although exceptions have sometimes to be permitted it is not customary to make them. When such an exception is made it would be owing to the absence of any other suitable person in the office.</membercontribution></p>

<title>IRISH WORKHOUSE DIETARY.</title>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01961"><member>MR. DALY <memberconstituency>(Monaghan, S)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: I beg to ask the Chief Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland whether he is aware that the change made in the diet of the inmates of workhouses in Ireland last year, while imposing 20 to 30 per cent, of an increase in the cost of keeping of each inmate, is not satisfactory to boards of guardians or the inmates; and whether he will leave this question for settlement by the guardians and the medical officer of the workhouse, and not have the fixed rule laid down by the Local Government Board some time since, and which medical officers were directed privately by the Board to have carried out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01962"><member>THE CHIEF SECRETARY FOR IRELAND (Mr. WYNDHAM, <memberconstituency>Dover</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: Recent changes in the diet of inmates of workhouses, made in accordance with the suggestions of the Local Government Board, have not imposed an increase of 30 per cent, in the cost of maintenance. Since
<image src="S4V0090P0I0406"/>
<col>577</col>
the issue of the Board's circular, the cost of maintenance in Irish workhouses has increased from 3s. 2d. per head to 3s. 2&#x00BE;d. The Board has not laid down any fixed rule to govern the dietary of workhouse inmates beyond the minimum scale prescribed by the Workhouse Rules of 1849. Less than this scale could not lie allowed, because it would be insufficient to maintain life. The circular of the 13th November, 1899, to which presumably the hon. Member refers, suggested a revision of the existing dietaries on more varied lines, so far as children are concerned. The workhouse medical officers were not directed privately to have the suggestions carried out. The guardians of many unions have shown unwillingness to incur increased expenditure in this matter, but if the improved dietary has not been satisfactory to the inmates in any instances, the Board believes it must be upon the ground that the improvement has not been sufficient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-01963"><member>MR. DALY</member><membercontribution>: Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the Visiting Committee of the Carrickmacross Workhouse has intimated that it is not satisfied with the new dietary, which is costing the rates of the union several hundred pounds additional?</membercontribution></p>

This information, without which a loan cannot be made, has not yet been supplied to the Board; any delay, therefore, cannot, be fairly attributed either to the Hoard of Works or to the Treasury.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-01977"><member>MR. WYNDHAM</member><membercontribution>: The Local Government Board has not issued orders in excess of its authority. Its authority is very clearly defined in Section 115 (Subsection 18) of the Local Government Act. The Court of Appeal decided that the preliminary steps taken by the Board to determine the amount in each case were informal, and quashed the orders on that ground. The authority of the Board to determine the increases was not mentioned by the Court. The Board, need I say, is prepared to acquiesce in the decision of the Court of Appeal in respect of every other case in which the orders are brought up on a writ of certiorari. It will make new orders in all such cases, and base its decision in each case upon the lines indicated by the Court of Appeal.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02049"><member>*MR. YOXALL <memberconstituency>(Nottingham, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> Said that during the last twelve mouths they had had in the administration of the Board of Education a very serious departure from those principles which had been laid down in the past in this House and a very serious blow had been struck at the integrity and efficiency of the higher elementary school work of this realm. He found that, in January, 1899. Little more than two years ago, the Vice-President of the Committee of Council on Education made a statement which was then, and was now, he believed, in consonance with the wishes of the
<image src="S4V0090P0I0415"/>
<col>595</col>
House and the desires of the country. He would quote that statement and then proceed to show the Committee to what extent and in what manner the administration of the Board of Education had departed from the sound principles laid down by the Minister in charge himself. Speaking at Bradford, the right hon. Gentleman said that "he thought that it would be a most unfortunate thing if the hoard schools, the higher elementary schools, and the schools of science in the large cities were in any way interfered with." He had to submit to the Committee that the operations of the school boards in the great cities of the country in their higher grade schools and schools of science had been very seriously interfered with by the Board of Education under the administration of the right lion, Gentleman himself.<lb/>
The Committee would remember that little more than twelve months ago a great amount of feeling was manifested in the House upon the question of higher elementary school work. A new principle of allocating the Parliamentary grant to elementary schools had been brought in. And one consequential feature of it was, that the schools which bad previously received the highest grants were by the levelling system cut down in tin amount which they drew from the grant. A formidable agitation grew up in the country that the higher grade schools were being unjustly treated, and in March, 1900, the Government, through the mouthpiece of the right hon. Gentleman, announced a compromise and promised to put organised schools and higher grade schools on a legal and legitimate footing. That promise had not been carried out, and the Higher Elementary School Minute, adopted in April last with general approval of the House, at a time when the feeling of hon. Members of all sections was so strong, had not been adhered to, and in spirit, if not in letter, that Minute had become something like an administrative fraud. He must go back further than twelve months ago in order to deal with the whole question of the attack on higher grade schools, which, if not initiated and not favoured, bad at least been not repudiated by the Board of Education, and by the right hon. Gentleman himself. This attack had grown and grown
<col>596</col>
Until the higher grade schools and the organised science schools were in great peril. The evening continuation schools were in greater peril, and the machinery set up in April last had been nullified and stultified by the Board of Education itself. Four years ago, by the enter prise of many school boards, schools had been set up something after the pattern of <i>Les Ecoles Primaires Superieures</i> in France, and the higher grade schools in Germany. These schools were fostered and encouraged by the Board of Education, grants were given to them, and expression of satisfaction were made regarding the work done by them. The Vice-President of the Council went down to the country to open these schools sometimes all official from the Board of Education itself performed that duly, and, generally speaking, the policy of the Department was to foster and encourage, approve and improve these schools. But a change came over that policy. Schools which had been built by school boards, some of them on the invitation even of the Board of Education, for the express purpose of giving this higher grade education, were refused grants when application was made for them by the school hoards. Money laid out in furnishing physical and chemical laboratories, and in the preparation of rooms for drawing and other higher elementary work, became of non-effect and all this was done by the order of the Board of Education under the right hon. Gentleman.<lb/>
Now, the Board of Education existed by the will of the people of this country. And the right hon. Gentleman himself, as its head, existed to promote and not to retard education and it there were any gentlemen on the Board of Education who were of opinion that education was to be kept at a standstill, marking time, so to speak, and that what was regarded as a satisfactory amount of education twenty-five years ago was sufficient now, then they entirely misinterpreted the feeling of the House and the country. Those higher grade schools were fulfilling an admirable function. They were not very numerous, only some sixty in all, but, such as they were, they were preparing lads of from thirteen to sixteen years of age to enter the technical
<image src="S4V0090P0I0416"/>
<col>597</col>
Schools and colleges of the country with that preliminary knowledge which the director's of these schools and colleges found to be non-existent formerly. They were preparing these lads to become captains of industry, managers, foremen, draftsmen, chemists, and leaders of the industrial classes. If one lesson was to be gained from the Reports of Royal Commissions and private investigators as to the condition of things in France, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and America, it was that the cause that the success of the manufacturing processes in these countries, compared with our own, consisted in the higher education of foremen, managers, leaders, etc. The higher education of the great mass of the operatives was comparatively unimportant to that. The higher grade schools and the schools of science existed for providing an education of that kind, which was vitally necessary to the continued existence of the manufacturing industries of this country. The change had begun through the action of an institution that had been condemned both in the House and in the country&#x2014; the old Science and Art Department at South Kensington. When the Board of Education issued a Day School Code, it had to lie on the Table of the House for a certain number of days, and could be upset by the vote of the House: but this Science and Art Department had had the extraordinary power of being able to issue their own rules and regulations without consulting the House or laying them on the Table at all.<lb/>
The reactionary, foolish, almost criminal policy of hampering the schools appeared to have found a ready supporter in the right hon. The Vice-President of the Council. The first step taken was to disable school boards from receiving Science and Art grants for science and art classes and organised science schools. But grants were given to all sorts of unimportant and unrepresentative bodies in fact, to any committee of two or three gentlemen, if only they could get sonic little local support in the way of fees or subscriptions. Ordinary grammar schools maintained very largely by endowments, and proprietary schools run as a commercial concern for profit, might apply for these science grants and
<col>598</col>
Get them but by a ukase of this self-constituted and independent section of the Board of Education, issued last year, school boards might not make application for grants to their schools except Upon conditions. They must find local support in the shape of fees, which was opposed entirely to the policy of tree education, or they must obtain support from a rate levied under the Technical Instruction Act. Now the Department knew that very few local authorities rated themselves under the Technical Instruction Act. They did not sec the use of doing that when there was a school rate already drawn by the same authority from the same ratepayer.<lb/>
The policy was first of all to disable the school boards from obtaining Science and Art grants for their schools. That being done by the autocratic procedure of the Board of Education, the next step was to disable the school boards from making up this loss by preventing them from using the school board rate for the purposes of higher education.<lb/>
Having succeeded in disabling the school boards from participating in Science and Art grants, except on condition of charging fees, the next step was to prevent the boards from using the school board rate. The result was that a School of Art in North London, a relic of the era of philanthropic enterprise, drew the attention of the Local Government Board to the expenditure of the London School Board in science and art classes and evening continuation schools. The auditor, under the circumstances, was obliged to test the question raised, and it was desirable to know whether the Board of Education was represented at the audit, and whether the attention of the auditor was drawn to the past administration of the Board in that matter, and whether any care was taken by the Board to see that the auditor was fully informed upon the question from the point of view of public policy, and of law, and of the minutes having the force of law. The Committee would also wish to know whether the Board of Education made any representations. Or whether it did anything more than sit quiet and wait the decision of the law courts upon what had taken place. The case stood for appeal to a higher court, and meanwhile there was
<image src="S4V0090P0I0417"/>
<col>599</col>
the unseemly spectacle of the authority charged with the duty of providing higher elementary education compelled to go into the law courts and spend the money of the ratepayers in defending the right of the authority to give higher education. Last April the policy of the Government was to favour and encourage and to reward the higher elementary schools' efforts. What had the Board of Education done since last April to make the actions of the board schools legal by minutes or otherwise to make such administration applicable. Nothing had been done by the Board of Education, and, so long as the present policy existed, nothing would be done. It was significant that a committee had been formed to fight school boards on this question, and had for its chairman the noble Lord the Member for Greenwich, while another prominent member of the committee and associated with him was long the leader of the Moderate party on the London School Board, and now, he believed, Member for Aston. The result had been that the work of the school boards in regard to science classes had been paralysed. The work of evening continuation schools had been damaged irretrievably or retarded for years to come. The condition had been imposed that education should be confined to persons under sixteen, and as a consequence 150,000 persons in those schools last year would, if the decision were upheld, be ousted from that means of education.<lb/>
They had been told that the Higher Elementary School Minute would place science schools on a legal and legitimate footing, but he complained that out of 190 applications the Department had sanctioned only two in eleven months. The London School Board made application for the recognition of seventy-nine schools, in various localities of London, to which the most promising children of the elementary schools were to be drafted. All the principal school boards of the country, too, made application for recognition of higher elementary schools, and again and again they had failed. All sorts of pretexts had been made for the refusal of recognition. It had been impossible for the local authorities to please the Board of Education, and no school board in the country was
<col>600</col>
Satisfied with the way in which the Minute had been administered and hardly one but was disgusted with the administration of the right hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Gentleman, no doubt, would say he expected when this Minute was put forward that the ordinary science schools would be transformed into higher elementary schools, and would probably say that he was not to blame but that was not the opinion generally held. In an organised science school a boy might remain until the age of eighteen, but according to the Higher Elementary School Minute the moment he arrived at fifteen he had to leave. Other conditions laid down in the Minute made it impracticable, and the right hon. Gentle-man was warned at the time it was put forward that it would be so.<lb/>
All this indicated, he submitted, something like a deliberate policy, engineered by whom, and arising from what sources, he would not attempt to discuss. It was something like a deliberate policy to check the higher elementary education, nullify the efforts of the school boards, and change the whole policy of the country in respect to these schools, and the Committee ought to consider that such a policy was not the kind of work they expected the Board of Education to do, and not the kind of work for which money was voted in Committee for the Board of Education. Having disabled the school boards, having refused to recognise the higher elementary schools, having destroyed one useful set of machinery which had existed for twenty-four years, having refused to set up a new set of machinery, he could find no excuse for the course which the Board had pursued. From what quarter and from what machinery they were to get the higher primary school at all? There was no secondary education department set up by statute. The school boards had been refused power to set up these schools, and there was no authority capable of supplying them. Higher elementary education was to go by the board. They had to wait, he supposed, for higher primary schools to be built and managed by an authority not yet created. In the meantime the excellent work done up to now was hampered and arrested, and if the appeal in another place went against them it was to come entirely to
<image src="S4V0090P0I0418"/>
<col>601</col>
an end. The right hon. Gentleman the Vice-President of the Council would quibble, if he might use the term, between higher elementary schools and secondary schools, and distinguish between one authority and another, and east himself on the protection of the law. No doubt he would give a very plausible explanation of the whole circumstances, but the hon. Member would ask the Committee to remember that the net result of all these proceedings was bad. The right hon. Gentleman would tell them that the Government were limited at present by legal considerations. They had heard a good deal of that kind of thing from the right hon. Gentleman. There was nobody more eloquent and less operative than the right hon. Gentleman, but eloquent platitudes and amusing epigrams were poor food for the educational needs of the country.<lb/>
In moving that the Vote he reduced by &#x00A3; 100 he asked the Committee to declare that the time had come when they wished the Education Board to make a serious attempt to provide for the people of the country that higher elementary education which they stood in need of, and which it was in the interests of the country they should have.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02050">Motion made, and Question proposed, "That the Item, Vote 1, Class 4 (Board of Education), be reduced by &#x00A3; 100."&#x2014; (<i>Mr. Yoxall</i>)</p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02051"><member>THE VICE-PRESIDENT of the BOARD OF EDUCATION (Sir J. GORST, <memberconstituency>Cambridge University</memberconstituency>)</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member who has just sat down complained of two things. First, he complained that school boards had not power to spend the school board rate upon, instruction outside the subjects of the Elementary Education Code in day schools and night schools; and, secondly, he complained that under the Higher Elementary School Minute of last year the school boards did not get large enough Exchequer grants for their higher elementary schools.<lb/>
Now it is quite true that these higher elementary schools sprang up almost immediately after the passing of the Elementary Education Act of 1870. They were not invented by either Governments or societies; they really sprang up by themselves. I do not think any
<col>602</col>
the worse of them for that, for such schools are better suited to meet the wants of the people than those invented for them by politicians. I want to ask the Committee to remember what the hon. Member has not explained as yet, that there are two absolutely different kinds of higher grade schools. In the first place, there are a number of higher grade schools which teach each of the subjects of the Elementary Day School Code. They were formerly under the Education Department. They were inspected by the officers of the Education Department, and they were subject to all the rules of the Education Department. I have very often been asked how many of this sort of schools there are. I am sorry to say that I have never been able to answer the question, because there is every kind of school in the shading off from the most elementary school in the country up to the very best of these higher grade schools, and every possible variation of schools between one extreme and the other which keep within the limits of the Elementary Day School Code. It is impossible to say where to draw the line and to say of the schools above. "These are higher grade schools." and of the schools below, "These are only ordinary elementary schools." But there is no doubt there are a very great number of them. The legality of these schools has never been called in question, nor has the right of the school board to spend the rates in building and maintaining such schools ever been called in question. The right to spend the rates on schools of this kind is not in any way affected or called in question by the recent judgment. But, besides these higher grade schools, of the legality of which there has never been any question, there is another kind of higher grade school which I will describe. It is a school which consists of two divisions&#x2014; an upper division and a lower division. The lower division is a public elementary school it very generally takes the older children in the higher standards, it takes specific subjects, and it obtains its grants from the Education Department, and is conducted as an elementary school. The upper division is not a public elementary school at all it is, frankly, an organised school of science. It has no chil-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0419"/>
<col>603</col>
dren In the standards. It takes not the subjects of the Elementary Day School Code, but the science and art subjects of the Directory. It is inspected by the inspectors of the Science and Art Department, and it receives its grant from that Department. It is an organised science and not a public elementary school. Schools of this kind, of which there are about sixty or seventy in the country, are inspected by two distinct sets of inspectors. The Education Department inspector inspects the lower division and shuts his eyes to the existence of the higher division, of which he is not officially cognisant. The Science and Art Department inspector comes in his turn and inspects the other division. And closes his eyes to the existence of the lower division, with which he has officially nothing whatever to do. There is no inspection of these schools as a whole. There are no proper accounts kept of these schools as a whole, and they are kept as a sort of double institutions such as I have described. Schools of this kind have never been declared to be illegal either by the Education Department or by the judgment in the recent ease. There is no illegality in the establishment of such schools. The illegality is in the application of the school rate to the building or maintenance of the upper division of that school. That is not a new discovery of mine or of the Science and Art Department. It has been known ever since schools of this kind were conducted.<lb/>
I will just give the Committee an example or two of what was said in past times. I have here an official letter from the Education Department to the Barrow-in-Furness School Board, written in 1884, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"I am to point out that the provision of a separate school for science and art classes does not appear to come within the province of a school board."</quote>
Then there is a letter from the Local Government Board to the London School Board, in November, 1885, when an auditor had disallowed an expenditure of the Board exactly analogous to that which was disallowed the other day. The Local Government Board says&#x2014;
<quote>"The School Board have no authority in law to establish or maintain a science and art school at the expense of the school fund,
<col>604</col>
Because that school is not an elementary school within the meaning of the Education Acts."</quote>
Then there is a letter written to the London School Board in 1888, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"An organised science and art school is quite distinct from a public elementary school. In such a school the money paid by the Science and Art Department to the managers forms no part of the receipts or expenditure of the school as a public elementary school&#x2026; The rates cannot legally be applied to supply instruction in any subject which is not recognised by the Code and taught to the children in the standards."</quote>
I have another letter written, in 1888, by the Local Government Board to the Brighton School Board, who had also had their expenditure disallowed by their auditor upon similar grounds. It says&#x2014;
<quote>"The school board had no legal authority to pay out of the funds of the school board any part of the costs of establishing and maintaining an organised school of science, the school not being an elementary one within the meaning of the Education Acts."</quote>
I find again, in 1892, a letter to the Hanley School Board, which says&#x2014;
<quote>"The higher section of the [higher grade] school organised as proposed and receiving grants from the Science and Art Department as an organised science school would not be a public elementary school, nor could the cost of the erection of the premises in which it was to be conducted be included in a loan sanctioned by this Department."</quote>
I think that that will show that the expenditure of the school rate on the maintenance of schools like the upper department of this kind of upper grade school has all along been declared by the Education Department to be illegal, and the judgment given the other day only confirmed the statements of the. Department under every kind of Minister, from the time these schools were, established down to the present day. There was no difficulty about the buildings, because the schools were established in buildings which were already in existence, or which, in some cases, were given for the purpose.<lb/>
As regards maintenance, the schools were at the outset maintained not out of the school rate, but by fees and the Science and Art grants. Some of the school boards boasted not only that the schools were not a burden on the rates,
<image src="S4V0090P0I0420"/>
<col>605</col>
but that the ratepayers made a profit from the fact that the school board managed a school of this kind. I should like to establish what I have said by a quotation or two. The Brighton School Board writes, in lc887&#x2014;
<quote>"If the amount of the fees received is taken into account, it will he seen that a profit to the ratepayers has resulted."</quote>
Before the Education Commission in 1884, Mr. Scotson, the headmaster of the Central Higher Grade School, Manchester, said, in answer to a question on this point, "It is practically more than self-supporting." He very frequently had more than &#x00A3;150 to distribute amongst the teachers, of which &#x00A3;50 used to go to himself. A great deal has been said in these controversies about the late Mr. Mundella's Circular in 1882, which undoubtedly encouraged the establishment of these schools. What did he say? I have never seen it quoted&#x2014;
<quote>"Under a well-organised system of graded schools the cost to the ratepayers need not be greater than it is now."</quote></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02052"><member>MR. YOXALL</member><membercontribution>: With the Science and Art grants.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02053"><member>Sir J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: Then Mr. Macarthy, the chairman of the Birmingham School Board, gave evidence before the Secondary Education Commission in 1895, and this is what he said&#x2014;
<quote>"I should like to say that the present Board secondary school can only rightly exist if, so far as its most ordinary work is concerned&#x2014; namely, the real secondary work&#x2014;it costs the local rates nothing. Practically, such schools are dependent on grants from the Science and Art Department."</quote>
To show my <i>bona fides</i> in the matter, I may mention that in 1890, when I was comparatively new to this office, I wrote an article, on education, which appeared in the <i>Nineteenth Century.</i> That article was very much complained of on some accounts, but this particular passage was criticised by no one&#x2014;
<quote>"The Boards, as purveyors of higher educacation, allege that they make a profit which inures to the benefit of the ratepayers."</quote>
That shows my <i>bona fide</i> belief of a few years ago, that the school rate was not spent on the maintenance of these schools, and that they were really not
<col>606</col>
Only self-supporting, but, in some cases, even a source of profit to the ratepayers.<lb/>
Then there is the question of buildings. That, of course, is the difficulty. A school board cannot raise a loan to build a school without obtaining the sanction of the Education Department to the loan. School boards from time to time applied for loans to build schools of this kind, but they were always told that it would not be legal to charge such loans upon the school rates. Yet, in spite of that, it is quite true that such schools have been built and the expenditure met out of loans charged on the school rate. I will illustrate what the <i>modus operandi,</i> generally, was. An application was made by the Brighton School Board for sanction to a loan for building a higher grade school, in which the upper portion should be a school of science. They were informed that such a use of the school board funds was illegal. That application was then withdrawn, and an application was made for a public elementary school giving science instruction under the Code, and having laboratories for that purpose. Sanction to that was given, the school was built, and was at once used not as a public elementary school, but as a school of science.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02054"><member>MR. YOXALL</member><membercontribution> was understood to say that in the case of Hanley the building built with the loan referred to was a public elementary school and an organised school of science as well, but the main part of it was used for the purposes of the latter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02055"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: I will give the facts of that case. The Hanley School Board, in 1892, asked for sanction to a school which was to begin at Standard VII., and have a higher department as an organised science school. The Education Department replied that such a department would not be a public, elementary school, nor could the cost of the erection of the premises in which it was conducted be included in the loan sanctioned by the Department under the Elementary Education Acts. The school board replied withdrawing that part of the scheme, and saying that the chemical laboratory, art room, etc., would now be used for the instruction of children
<image src="S4V0090P0I0421"/>
<col>607</col>
In the standards of the Education Code. The loan was thereupon sanctioned. The school was opened on 24th May, 1804, and a school of science started in the building. Three years after there were 191 pupils in the organised science school, no science at all being taught to the children in the standards.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02056"><member>MR. YOXALL</member><membercontribution>: Will the right hon. Gentleman quote the figures for the school as a whole, or allow me to do so?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02057"><member>Sir J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: The hon. Member will have an opportunity afterwards; it is not germane to my argument. I am illustrating how it came about that although the Education Department said it was illegal, yet these schools were built. I will give another very recent ease which shows exactly how the thing is done. In February, 1899, when attention had been called to this illegality and everybody was aware of it, the Leeds School Board wrote for sanction to a building they required for science accommodation and intended for the use of scholars in the primary elementary schools taking the scientific subjects in accordance with the scheme of science laid down in the Code. The reply of the Education Department was this&#x2014;
<quote>"We understand the premises to he required for the purposes of a primary elementary school in which science is to he taught in accordance with the scheme laid down in the Code; that the science rooms are not more than sufficient for these purposes; that they will be used for these purposes; and upon that understanding we sanction the loan."</quote>
That is clear enough. But this is what the school board say in their report eighteen months later&#x2014;
<quote>"The fine structure now in course of erection in Burton Street is to be the future home of the present Southern Higher Grade School',</quote>
&#x2014;which is a school of science. I thereupon directed a letter to the school board to ask how they reconciled the condition on which they accepted the sanction to the loan with this statement in their report, but I am sorry to say, although that letter was sent some time ago, they have not yet offered an explanation.<lb/>
The hon. Member in his speech said that if this judgment is affirmed on appeal it will not touch the buildings, because they are built and done with. But the judgment will, as the hon. Member
<col>608</col>
Pointed out, strike at the revenue of the schools. It will prevent the rates being any longer spent in the maintenance of these schools, which, I may say, nobody wishes to see injured or destroyed. The school boards will have three courses open to them. First of all they can return to the condition of things, if it is possible to return to it, which obtained in the early days of these schools; they can charge fees and make the schools self-supporting, as Mr. Mundella said they ought to be, with the provision of free places for children whose parents are unable to pay the fees, but who deserve to be educated in a school of this kind. The second possibility is, to come to terms with the local authority which has power to rate for this purpose. The hon. Member was very scornful about that. The real point is that the borough or urban council has power to lay a rate to be applied to this purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02058"><member>Mr. YOXALL</member><membercontribution>: Up to a penny.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02059"><member>Sir J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: Yes, and a penny would in most cases be sufficient. That arrangement is actually in operation at Jarrow-on-Tyne and New Mills, Derbyshire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02060"><member>Mr. YOXALL</member><membercontribution>: In two cases&#x0021;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02061"><member>Sir J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: Those are two cases I know of and can verify, but I have every reason to believe that there are many other cases, and if there were time I have no doubt I could find them. There is the case of Ulverston. Ulverston was one of the school boards that applied to have an elementary school, and correspondence took place. Undoubtedly they did not want a higher elementary school at all; they wanted a school of science. Negotiations are now going on which, I believe, will be brought to a satisfactory conclusion, by which the county of Lancaster will lay a penny rate in the town of Ulverston and apply that rate to the maintenance of this school.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02065"><member>Sir J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: In Ulverston. The Ulverston penny rate is unfortunately already appropriated to some other purpose, and in order to make the thing legal the Ulverston people have requested the county of Lancaster to lay a penny rate upon them, and I have every reason to believe that in the course of a few weeks that will be done, and the rate applied, with the consent of all parties, to enable the school to be established in a legal manner.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02066"><member>Sir JOHN BRUNNER</member><membercontribution>: Will Ulverston then be able to spend twopence in the pound?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02067"><member>Sir J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: Yes. I do not think there is any danger of any one of these schools, if it is a good school, being injured, even assuming the judgment is confimed. The final course open is the Higher Elementary School Minute. I stated last year that the Higher Elementary School Minute was invented on purpose for these schools; it was intended, in the event of the judgment being in acordance with the legal opinion of the Board of Education, to legalise their position.<lb/>
I must now say a few words about the evening schools. Evening schools are the most chaotic part of the whole of our chaotic system. Evening school instruction ranges from the three R's &#x2014;which generally have been previously taught to the scholars at the public expense and are being taught again at the public expense&#x2014;up to such subjects as drawing from the life, differential and integral calculus, spherical trigonometry, and advanced processes of metallurgy. These evening continuation schools draw their revenue from public as well as from private sources. They get their revenue firstly from the rates, which is perfectly legal so long as they keep within the very wide range of the Evening Continuation School Code. Then they draw revenue from the county council for technical instruction, and they also have local taxation money, which comes from the Chancellor of the
<col>610</col>
Exchequer, and which is distributed through the county council. They also have a grant from the Science and Art Department and the grant for elementary education. These schools are inspected by four different sets of inspectors, and they are established by one set of managers who compete with those schools set up by another set of managers, and thus pupils are drawn from schools supported by public money. In the case of London the London School Board took upon itself some three years ago, without any definite Parliamentary authority, to make all the evening schools free, and the effect of making these evening schools free has been not to draw students out of the streets, but to draw students from other schools and institutions. There is no doubt that in the case of a great many of the polytechnics receiving public money the students are drawn away into the schools because they have to pay either smaller fees or no fees at all. It is quite true that if the judgment is confirmed on appeal, these evening schools, maintained by the rates, will not be able to teach subjects outside the Evening School Continuation Code, and they will not be able to teach science.<lb/>
The Lord President of the Council was asked in the House of Lords the other day <sup>*</sup> whether he would bring in a Bill to cure this difficulty, and from the answer my noble friend gave in another place. I cannot promise, and hon. Members must not expect, that the Government will bring in any Bill which will deal with this specific complaint of school boards. But the Government will bring in a Bill, as my noble friend said in the House of Lords, upon which all these points can be raised, and upon which a Parliamentary decision can be taken. The Government will bring in a Bill for the creation of secondary education authorities having power to provide public instruction in those subjects which are not contained in the Elementary and Evening Continuation Schools Codes. Parliament will then decide whether there is to be one authority for dealing with education. If it decides that there should be only one, it will
<quote><sup>*</sup> See preceding volume of Debates, page 978.</quote>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0423"/>
<col>611</col>
then have to say who that authority shall be. If Parliament decides to have two authorities, the House will then have to decide what definition of higher education shall be adopted, and where the limit of one authority ceases and that of the other begins.<lb/>
Parliament will also have to decide another matter which has never yet been brought to a decision. That is, whether it is for the interest of the country that adults shall receive this higher education or any education at the expense, of the country. I do not wish to prejudice this question at all. There is, of course, a great deal to be said on both sides. But take a case of this kind: A person of mature life wishes to amuse himself, to provide himself with recreation by drawing. Has he any right to ask the ratepayers or the taxpayers to pay not only the cost of his being taught, but also of the materials which he uses?&#x2014;because, I am told, anybody who wishes to learn drawing has nothing to do but to walk into one of the London evening continuation schools, and he can there get most excellent instruction and have all his materials found for him. It may be right that that should be done, but I think Parliament ought to decide it. I do not think it is right that even such an august body as the London School Board should decide that question without the authority of Parliament, and certainly upon the Bill to be brought in the House will have an opportunity of deciding this question.<lb/>
I have already detained the House rather a long time, but I must briefly refer to the Higher Elementary School Minute. The, Higher Elementary School Minute does no doubt diminish the Exchequer grants received by the higher grade schools of the type to which I have been referring, and that I say is perfectly legal and perfectly light. That question was discussed last session. It is inseparable from the system of the block grant that those schools that are earning most from the Government should suffer; hut, on looking through the figures, I find that the School Board of London all through London has lost only &#x00A3;4,000 by the operation of the block grant system, representing a one-thirty-seventh of a penny rate.
<col>612</col>
Cardiff lost one-sixth of a penny, Liverpool one-fifteenth of a penny, Manchester one-eighth of a penny, and so on. I do not think the higher grade schools are in any danger, because a slightly greater proportion of their cost will be defrayed by rates and a slightly less proportion will be paid out of the Consolidated Fund. It does not seem to me to be reasonable that rich schools should come to this House and cry out that we are destroying the higher grade schools by putting on them a charge of one-thirty-seventh of a penny.<lb/>
I do not think that I need say much more. The agitation that is going on in regard to this matter is really an attempt on the part of the school boards of the country to get themselves made secondary education authorities as the school boards are in Scotland. We can discuss that when the Bill to which I have already referred comes on. I will only just say briefly what are my objections to the school board as the education authority. My first objection is its inapplicability to the rural districts, which require higher education quite as much as, if not more than, the great towns. My second objection is that the methods of the school boards have the effect of destroying excellent institutions which already exist and which are doing really good work. I am sorry to say that the figures show that there is not the slightest doubt that the secondary schools of London, which have been aided by the Technical Instruction Committee of the London County Council, and which are very efficient schools, have been injured by the higher grade schools of the London School Board; for whereas formerly a great number of children from the elementary schools found their way into these secondary schools, they are now kept out of these schools because the School Board keep them in the inferior schools, and they are not allowed to enter the higher schools. It will be seen that, so far from giving the children of working men a better education, you are actually preventing them getting the better education which they would otherwise get. My third objection is that the type of school established by the school board is not the type you would like to see all over this country.

<col>613</col>
It is tainted by the defects of our elementary school system&#x2014;defects which lead to too much of an attempt to drill and too much training of the children, and too little attempt is made to develop their character and give them any originality of their own. You cannot help this if you have hundreds of children under one management, for it is impossible for the head of the school to superintend such a large number and to know enough of the children to enable him to develop their character at the same time. These are the reasons why we think the school boards should not be made the authority for these higher grade schools. One thing I quite admit, and that is, that we shall never have anything like a proper system of education in this country until we make up our mind what is to be the authority, until we have one authority, and until schools of every kind and every grade are placed under that authority. Then there will be no more overlapping, no more trouble about the particular kind of school, or the particular course of education to be given in it; because if you have one authority in a district you can lay out a plan of education suited to the wants of the people of that district, and you can build such schools as are necessary for the peculiar wants and idiosyncrasies of the people of the district. You would have education carried on in a sensible and business kind of manner, and you would get rid of the chaos which exists at present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02068"><member>*MR. J. H. WHITLEY <memberconstituency>(Halifax)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he wished to draw the attention of the right lion, the Vice-President to the special difficulties under which evening continuation schools at present laboured. He could speak with some little authority on this question, from the fact that for the last fifteen years he had been engaged in Halifax in the management of some of the most successful continuation schools in the country. The first thing he wanted was the abolition of the 17s. 6d. Limit. He did not know whether it had been an oversight on the part of the right hon. Gentleman, but when the Day School Code abolished the 17s. 6d. Limit, it was left in existence in regard to evening schools, which was an extreme hardship. For fifteen years those with
<col>614</col>
Whom he had been working had been labouring to raise the standard of education in those evening schools, and when, at the end of fourteen years, they were able to earn grants exceeding the 17s. 6d., they found that the money could not be paid because this iniquitous regulation still remained on the Evening School Code.<lb/>
The second matter which he wished to press on the right hon. Gentleman was the connection between the evening and the day schools. Three years ago the right hon. Gentleman introduced into the Evening School Code a regulation forbidding children who were attending a day school to attend, at the same time, an evening school. With the spirit of the regulation he agreed, but in actual practice it had resulted in considerable harm to the children they wished to benefit. His most important point was to get the children to pass from the day to the evening school without the break. His experience showed that unless they did that, the chances were doubled or tripled that they would never get them into the evening schools. He would ask whether the right hon. Gentleman would not consider a system whereby a child, within six months of leaving a day school, could enter an evening school. The two systems would overlap in the least degree, but they could be so arranged as to take away the probability of break. What happened was this. Unless a child became a "full timer" during the six months of the summer, he was inable to begin the evening school session at the proper time. All the classes had been arranged, and the children had fixed on their companions. The child did not like to go into the school halfway through the winter session, and therefore in many cases he said he would not go to the evening school until next year. When the break was once made in this way the chances were that they never got such children into evening schools at all. It a reasonable modification of the regulation made eight years ago were introduced, it would not be a hardship on the children in the day schools, and would be a very great advantage to the country.<lb/>
The third matter he wished to press on the attention of the right hon. Gentleman was physical education in the evening schools. In the evening schools
<image src="S4V0090P0I0425"/>
<col>615</col>
with which he was connected, he had insisted, in spite of the Evening School Code, on a large proportion of physical education. Hon. Members must remember that they were dealing with children who had spent ten hours already at work; and he had always held that it was not advisable that such children should have their education based entirely on book work. Therefore, in his evening schools, it had always been essential that physical drill and gymnastics should be carried on alongside and with mental instruction. He attributed to that fact a large part of the success of these schools, and the high percentage of the regular attendance at them. He would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, when he was arranging his next Code, he would not put in a specific grant for physical culture under proper precautions. In the present condition of the Army and Navy there was nothing more important than that our youths should get more regular and systematic physical education in the evening schools. He had heard with gratification the concluding words of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, when he asserted that the Bill he was going to introduce into the House would not be like some other Bills, or like the laws of the Medes and Persians, which could not be altered, but that it would be a Bill which the House could discuss in a businesslike manner, not a cast-iron Bill which they must accept or reject. He trusted that the promise would be fulfilled, and that the Bill would be brought in and discussed in a broad spirit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02069"><member>MR. FLOWER <memberconstituency>(Bradford, W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said there were two or three matters to which he wished to draw the attention of the Committee and the right hon. Gentleman. First of all, however, he joined cordially in the concluding remarks of the hon. Gentleman opposite. He thought the time had now come when, in discussing matters affecting education, they might well eliminate party elements and think solely in a practical and business-like way of the very difficult and intricate problems with which they had to deal. The speech of the right hon. The Vice-President was an evidence of that fact.<lb/>
Passing from that, what was it that evening continuation schools were trying to do? They were trying three things&#x2014;
<col>616</col>
to combine what he would call a system of night schools with that of continuing the education of children from the elementary day schools, and with a <i>soup&#x00E7;on</i> of technical education&#x2014;and they were failing in the combination. At least, his experience on the London School Board was that the effort to combine the three systems in one was not a success. They had heard accounts brought before the London School Board of such evening continuation schools being opened free, but at a very large cost to the ratepayers, and of the classes being very largely attended. But the Committee would have smiled if they had heard the report as to the actual attendance at some of these classes. Nevertheless, the evening continuation schools of the London School Board were doing a great and useful work, and in these days when public attention was being directed to the large number of young people who were loafing about the streets, one would be sorry to do anything to curtail that useful work, although it needed to be systematised. He sincerely hoped from the speech of the Vice-President that it was the intention of the Government to steadily and persistently persevere in that course. The task was really not so very difficult. They had not to contend against any antagonism, or any public feeling, but only against the smaller petty jealousies between local bodies. Of course the ideal which the right hon. Gentleman had sketched of one central authority would be the true solution of the problem&#x2014;one local authority responsible for all education throughout well-defined areas.<lb/>
There was another matter to which he would like to draw attention, and again he did so in no party spirit. From time to time they heard of the educational progress in other countries. That had become almost a commonplace, and in metaphorical language it was urged that England was lagging behind other nations in this respect. Unhappily it was the truth. No matter what codes they might invent, or what authorities they might establish, they had got to I come back at last to the quality of the teachers who were going to impart the instruction. [An HON. MEMBER: And the number of them.] Those who were responsible for the education of this country might make every attempt in
<image src="S4V0090P0I0426"/>
<col>617</col>
other directions, but these would of necessity fail. The scarcity of places in the training colleges was now nothing less than a scandal. Representative after representative of the Education Department had, from the Treasury Bench, deplored the scarcity of places in the training colleges, even after the Chancellor of the Exchequer had met the request of the Education Department with a rebuke. The accommodation in the training colleges was wholly and utterly inadequate to meet the demand, and the result was that young teachers, with every hope that they might make themselves useful public servants, found themselves unable to complete their career or to obtain admission to the training colleges. Consequently they resorted to other professions, and the years of work they had given was lost, besides a considerable amount of public money expended on them. He hoped the Government would consider the question of increasing the number of training colleges. The ideal would be to link the training colleges to the universities, and give the young teachers a taste of that wider life which was obtained in a public university. But if that could not be done, they ought not to see the teachers of the future dropping out of the ranks&#x2014;hundreds, almost thousands, of capable young people who might be efficient and brilliant teachers, denied admission to the training colleges. He hoped and believed that the religious difficulty was not going any more to hinder them from working for the progress of education. He believed that all the religious difficulties could be settled by a five minutes conference round a common table, on the broad principle of "give and take."<lb/>
That brought him to another point which he wished to bring before the attention of the Committee&#x2014;namely, the securing of a reasonable fixity of tenure for the teachers. This equally applied to teachers in voluntary as in board schools. How could they hope to induce the young people of the country to become teachers unless there was some reasonable prospect of fixity of tenure, and some provision made against the arbitrary and capricious dismissal of teachers? He believed himself that that could be secured by a Minute of the
<col>618</col>
Education Department; but if not, it might be done by a Bill of an entirely non-contentious character. But until it was done there would from time to time arise cases of harsh, capricious, and cruel dismissal of teachers. And these would disgust a large number of young people who would otherwise enter the teaching profession.<lb/>
He would most respectfully and earnestly press on the attention of the right hon. Gentleman the matters which he had brought before the Committee; and he hoped that he would be permitted to express the anticipation that the Bill promised by the right hon. Gentleman would be introduced ere long in the House. At the present moment, all who engaged in the work of education were doing so under difficult conditions. There had been a legal decision of the King's Bench Division pronouncing that much of the education given by the school boards of recent years had been illegal. That decision had been appealed against, although the Education Department had very properly decided to continue paying the grants pending the appeal. This condition of chaos could not, however, and ought not to, go on much longer. It ought to be the serious work of the Government this session to simplify and regulate the education of the country as it ought to be, and to create an authority which would once for all put an end to the disastrous and extravagant system of overlapping, and place the public education of the country on a real businesslike footing.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02070"><member>*DR. MACNAMARA <memberconstituency>(Camberwell, K)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said they must all agree with the right hon. Gentleman that every grade of school and each kind of education should be in each district under the same local authority responsible to the people. The right hon. The Vice-President had told them that the right of any school board to use the rates for advanced instruction had been challenged in the courts of law. Now, the very fact of that challenge was, in his opinion, a very serious commentary on the capacity of the officials of the Education Department to interpret the Parliamentary statutes for the last thirty years. The late Mr. Mundella, a pre-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0427"/>
<col>619</col>
decessor of the right hon. Gentleman, had gone out of his way to invite the Welsh school boards to establish higher grade schools, although no doubt he had added that they ought to be self-supporting. But, apart from Mr. Mundella, the present Vice-President and other members of the Board of Education had gone down to the country and in various cities and towns made flamboyant speeches congratulating the people of these towns on founding higher grade schools. No opposition had ever been raised by the Department until the other day as to the propriety of using the school rates for the support of these schools. He did not propose to deal further with this part of the question, seeing that the decision of the courts had been challenged, and that the point must hereafter be decided by the final court of appeal.<lb/>
But what he wanted to come to was a matter which was not <i>sub judice,</i> and which had not been challenged in a court of law&#x2014;namely, the administration of the Higher Elementary Schools Minute. He hoped the House would excuse him if he went into this matter in some detail. Hon. Members would remember that the Education Code last year initiated a very salutary reform &#x2014; a reform due to the right hon. Gentleman, and which provided for the "block" grant instead of special grants. Under that system a large number of schools which had been devoting attention to a large number of specific subjects lost a great deal of money, and in response to the pressure from both sides of the House&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: Oh, oh.] &#x2014;well, or as a result of the spontaneous goodwill towards education which the right hon. Gentleman had always evinced in everything he had said&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02071"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution> said that he might explain that the grants to the higher grade schools and the schools of science would be continued until the legal issue of the appeal which had been made to the House of Lords on the point.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02072"><member>*DR. MACNAMARA</member><membercontribution> said he would confine his remarks to the Elementary School Minute of April last, which provided for special instruction and special grants. That Minute seemed to be a
<col>620</col>
genuine endeavour on the part of the right hon. Gentleman to provide facilities for the continuous education of the children of the working classes whose parents were willing to keep them at school up to fifteen years of age. It was on that statement that the hon. Member for Cambridge University based his suggestion for a Higher Elementary Education Minute. It was on the strength of this statement that it was a genuine endeavour to make provision for the further education of the working-class children&#x2014;rendered necessary by the cutting down of the grants under the Block grant system &#x2014; that the House has agreed that the Code and the Minute were conducive to the best interests of education. He did not want to put it offensively, but directly the matter had passed away from the House the scope of the Minute began to be dwarfed to a very alarming degree. The local authorities who applied for recognition of their schools under the Minute were promptly told that such schools to be recognised must have a curriculum bearing a close resemblance to the curriculum of a school of science. Schools of science were higher grade schools organised under rules of the now happily defunct Science and Art Department, and which had a curriculum mainly scientific. He complained of that administration; there was nothing in the Minute about conforming to a scientific course. The Minute was one merely establishing higher elementary schools, not higher elementary schools of science; and if that had been the intention of the Minute it would have been better for the House to have been told of it before it passed away from them. The Minute laid down that the Board should decide which grant should be paid in the case of each year's course after consulting the report and recommendation on four points&#x2014;the suitability of the instruction to the circumstances of the scholars and the neighbourhood; the thoroughness and the intelligence with which the instruction was given; the sufficiency and suitability of the staff; and the discipline and organisation. Of these four points the pregnant phrase was the first. Would the right hon. Gentleman argue that a course of instruction, mainly scientific, would be universally suitable to the use of all
<image src="S4V0090P0I0428"/>
<col>621</col>
schools in all neighbourhoods? If he did not argue in that way then there was nothing in the Minute which would justify the ruling which the Board of Education was now giving right and left, that the provisions of the Higher Elementary School Minute were not applicable to schools of a commercial type. He considered it was a most fatuous ruling. The one thing needed at the present time was opportunity for commercial training. It was always his impression that the Government believed that the one particular need of the moment was commercial education. At a conference held at the Guildhall on the question of commercial education, and which was convened by the London Chamber of Commerce, the Vice-President of the Council agreed that commercial education was in the opinion of the Government essential. That was also shown by the remarks made by the Home Secretary on the previous day when distributing prizes in connection with the London Chamber of Commerce scheme. The right hon. Gentleman said on that occasion, that in being present he was only performing his duty. "It would be a strange thing," he added, "if the Government of a great commercial country like this did not show an interest in a matter so vitally affecting the interests of the country." The way in which the Government showed that interest consisted in their rigidly declining to recognise schools which proposed to give commercial training. The Government must be very unworthy fiduciaries if they deprived the working classes of this one avenue to success which was now open to them. Everybody was alive to the importance of commercial education except those who ought to be most alive to it&#x2014;those who controlled education. He protested very strongly against this endeavour to rule out commercial training for the people. Although Lord Rosebery and the Colonial Secretary had recently made strong statements as to the necessity for commercial education, all that was received from the Board of Education was well summed up in a letter written to the London School Board:&#x2014;
<quote>"Business training cannot be recognised as part of the curriculum of higher elementary schools."</quote>
But the right hon. Gentleman might say that the Government never having
<col>622</col>
paid for commercial education could not begin to do so now; but that I would be an extraordinary statement to make, seeing that the country had I paid for commercial instruction and that the Board of Education in its Science and Art Directory made provision for commercial instruction. He hoped the Board of Education would see its way to modify this ruling at once. Let them contrast the system in this country, with that of Scotland. Why should not the one be as good as the other&#x2014;what was sauce for the Scotch gander surely was sauce for the English goose? In Scotland it was always desired that the local authorities should feel themselves free to vary the curriculum according to local needs, but that was not so in England, and the same remark applied to the age for leaving. In Scotland it could be extended to eighteen years, whilst in England it was ruled down to fifteen; the only complimentary explanation being that an English child could at the age of fifteen attain the same intellectual level as a Scotch child of eighteen. The local authorities of Bradford (the Manchester of the woollen trade) desired to have a higher elementary school organised on commercial lines, with French and German as the leading subjects. That was a suggestion which one would have thought would have been encouraged, but it was not, and Bradford was told that it could not have a school organised on commercial lines, it must be a school of science. There was nothing whatever in the Minute to justify any such ruling.<lb/>
The House had been told a short time ago that there had been some 190 applications for recognition under the Higher Elementary Minute. The same information had been given on the 31st of July last. Were they to understand that no applications were made during the seven months which intervene between those two dates? Out of those 190 applications two only had been recognised. That was the information given to the House nearly twelve months after the Minute was passed, that only two had been recognised out of 190. In London there were seventy-nine high grade schools, and the London School Board, disliking the science course, had foregone the preferential grants and took most of the cost out of
<image src="S4V0090P0I0429"/>
<col>623</col>
the ratepayers, because they preferred a general commercial curriculum. When the Higher Elementary Minute was introduced they suggested that these seventy-nine schools should be recognised, and the Board of Education magnanimously offered to recognise four, or rather the School Board authorities were told that the Board of Education would consider four out of the seventy-nine. Seventy-nine looked rather a high figure, but that was only one school to every 100,000 of the population. Surely every district with 100,000 population was entitled to one higher grade school. The answer which they obtained was that the Board of Education would consider the advisability of recognising the four schools of science, which would give two higher grade schools in Greenwich and two in Marylebone, those being the places in which these four schools were situated. In nine out of the eleven divisions of the London School Board there were no higher elementary schools under the Minute. In the Division of West Lambeth, which he himself represented, there were seven Parliamentary boroughs with 650,000 population, 130,000 of whom were children attending the elementary schools, and that division did not possess a higher elementary school under the Minute. That was not the spirit in which the Minute was placed before the House of Commons.<lb/>
He did not want to labour the point, but he could not help saying that, all the country over, there had been a set determination on the part of the Board of Education to put every conceivable obstacle in the way of establishing higher elementary education and the further development of the working-class children. It was simply marvellous how the rulings under the Minute were developing. In April last the Birmingham teachers applied through the Secretary to the Colonies that elementary and higher elementary schools might be held under one roof, and he received a letter from the Board of Education which contained the following&#x2014;
<quote>"The new Minute does not state that the new type of school must necessarily be in a totally separate building from an ordinary elementary school."</quote>
Shortly after that the Hebden Bridge School Board wrote to the Board of
<col>624</col>
Education on the same subject and received the following reply&#x2014;
<quote>"The Board of Education do not propose to sanction as higher elementary schools, schools which are in part used as ordinary elementary schools. Higher elementary schools must be separate and complete."</quote>
He submitted that such a ruling as that was in direct conflict with the ruling obtained by the Colonial Secretary on behalf of the Birmingham teachers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02073"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution> was understood to say that the second ruling was a mistake. He would not object to sanction as higher elementary schools, schools which were partly used as ordinary schools, and in many cases he had sanctioned them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02074"><member>*DR. MACNAMARA</member><membercontribution>: Had the right hon. Gentleman sanctioned the schools at Hebden Bridge? That was the school to which ho was referring, and he would be very much surprised to hear that the Board of Education had at Hebden Bridge sanctioned a higher elementary school and a primary school under one roof. If Minutes were administered in this manner they would before very long be administered entirely out of existence. It was impossible to fix these people. They dodged about from kopje to kopje in a way that put the activity of Christian De Wet into the shade. When endeavouring to fix the responsibility for the deliberate and reprehensible attempt to whittle down the Higher Elementary Minute, the difficulty with which one was confronted was that it was quite impossible to believe the Vice-President could be responsible, for every public utterance of his proclaimed him to be a generous and enlightened and progressive educationalist. Whoever was responsible, having regard to the manner in which we were plunged into the fiercest of commercial struggles with our foreign rivals, it was lamentable to the last degree. It was Little Englandism of the most pernicious type to put these obstacles in the way of most generous facilities for the intellectual equipment of the children of the people. He pleaded for a touch of Imperialism in this matter, and thought that the greatest possible facilities should be given by the Board of Education.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02075"><member>SIR W. HART DYKE <memberconstituency>(Kent, Dartford)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the debate had been one of extraordinary interest, and if it had shown one thing more than another, it had shown that it was high time that they had something more than these educational speeches from the right hon. Gentleman. It was high time that, after debate upon debate in this House, measures of the kind which had been shown with almost sickening reiteration to be necessary should be produced before them, and that an Act of Parliament should reduce this matter to a practical shape.<lb/>
Hon. Gentlemen who had spoken on the subject on this occasion had cast upon the administration of the Education Department the imputation that the treatment of higher grade schools for many years had been a serious reflection on the Education Department. He thought the reflection should rather be cast on the people of this country, who for thirty years past had shown so little interest in education. If they had taken half the interest in this question that they had taken in taxation and other matters a remedy would have been found long ago. All Governments had dreaded and shirked the difficulty of filling up the obvious gap between elementary and higher education. He appealed to the House never to cease to put pressure on the Government until the latter produced a measure and gave earnest of their intention to carry it to a practical conclusion. No Government ever had such an opportunity as the Government had at this moment of dealing with the question. This debate showed what an extraordinary change had come over public opinion in respect to this subject, not only outside but within the walls of that House. This new Parliament was prepared to deal practically with the question. He believed that hon. Members were prepared to make some sacrifices of principle on each side to secure a good measure. They were prepared to approach the matter, not as partisans of either the voluntary or school board system, but as educationists. He believed that before many years had passed, and when the first stress of pressure came as regarded our commercial supremacy, we should find what a bitter penalty we had to pay for
<col>626</col>
thirty years of negligence. Facts could be adduced which would show the fruit of the educational efforts in America as regarded the engineering trade. He believed that facts and figures would be brought before the House which would awaken hon. Members and the Government to the urgency of proceeding in this matter. His right hon. Friend had alluded to a Bill which was to come before the House. He believed that that Bill had the germs of success in it. He believed that the whole key of the position was that they must trust the representatives of the people in each locality. The less Parliament interfered with the localities the better. They must have a central authority, but the solution of the difficulty was to place the education of the people in some local authority in each district. He appealed to hon. Members, whatever the promised measure was, to remember the huge issues involved, to sink their political differences, and to endeavour to come to a wise and just conclusion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02076"><member>MR. BRYCE (Aberdeen, S.)</member><membercontribution> Said the discussion that day showed that there was a general feeling that the time had come for endeavouring to pass a comprehensive measure which would get rid of the evils and inconveniences which had been so strongly pointed out on the Opposition side of the House. The right hon. Gentleman the Vice-President did not grapple with the difficulty underlying the whole matter&#x2014;namely, the fact that the higher grade schools, which had been allowed to go on for a good many years, had suddenly found themselves dealt with in an entirely different spirit, and had found themselves in great difficulty in carrying on the work they did.<lb/>
The House would allow him to say how these higher grade schools came into existence. A Commission which reported in 18G8 pointed out that the greatest educational need of the country, besides, of course, the establishment of elementary schools, was the establishment of higher grade schools&#x2014;secondary schools which should give a practical education to children from the age of fourteen or fifteen for a moderate fee not exceeding &#x00A3;4 a year. Nothing had been done to give effect to that recommendation from that time to now, and except by the schemes
<image src="S4V0090P0I0431"/>
<col>627</col>
of the Endowed Schools Commissioners nothing was done to create these schools, which were the greatest need of the country then, and were the greatest need of the country still. Then came the Education Act of 1870, and two years after that Act came into operation the school boards, feeling that the benefits obtained in the elementary schools were very largely lost because the children could not carry their education further, started these higher grade schools. He did not think the right hon. Gentleman would dispute the growth of these higher grade schools. From that time to now they had been of the greatest possible benefit. No part of our educational machinery had been better than those sixty or seventy schools which would be hit at by the case now under appeal. Therefore this was a very serious case.<lb/>
It was not denied, and it would not be denied by the Education Department itself, that the line they had taken lately had been very different from the line taken at an earlier time. It would have been quite impossible for the school boards to have gone on as they had done continually developing these schools and working them out on larger lines if the Education Department had adopted the kind of policy which had been adopted lately. He did not at all deny that there were some drawbacks. One of them had been mentioned that night. Under the influence of the science and art grants these schools were going too exclusively on the scientific line. He did not deny that there were some places where it might be true that, as the right hon. Gentleman had pointed out, the higher grade schools were to some extent coming into competition with secondary schools in a way that made it difficult for them to carry on, but, on the whole, the balance of advantage was very greatly on the side of the higher grade schools. They had become so indispensable in the educational machinery of the country that any interference with them ought to have been avoided by the Board of Education. Well, under some influence, the origin of which he could not guess, the Board of Education had disregarded the danger, and they had checked the usefulness of these higher grade schools. He believed that at this moment these schools were in serious difficult, because in order
<col>628</col>
to satisfy the requirements of the Science and Art Department they had gone on incurring expenses, erecting schools, and purchasing apparatus. Now they found themselves suddenly cut off from the resources on which they had counted, and they were in serous financial difficulties.</membercontribution></p>

BRYCE</member><membercontribution> said that in that case the Board of Education ought to have framed their Minute in a different way, and they ought to have administered the Minute in a different spirit from that which they appeared to have pursued. These schools filled gaps, and were doing most useful work. The higher grade schools were doing most useful technical work, and he asked why it should be cut short. There was neither reason, consistency, nor public advantage in the line the Board of Education had taken.<lb/>
He agreed with the main conclusion of his right hon. Friend the Member for the Dartford Division that what was wanted was a systematic revision of the whole system. The Vice-President of the Council had said that there was a want of public interest in the question; but why was there a want of public interest? Because it was perfectly impossible for any private individual, unless he gave his mind to the study of the excessively complicated condition into which our
<image src="S4V0090P0I0432"/>
<col>629</col>
system of education had got, to understand anything about it. This was not a new matter. It had been admitted for years. It was dealt with in the fullest manner by the Royal Commission that reported in 1895. That Commission was unanimous. The right hon. Gentleman on every occasion he had addressed the House since had admitted that the matter was urgent. The present Government had a large majority. Why did it not deal with the question, and why by the Minute of last session did it actually begin to pull down the old house before erecting a new one? That ought not to have been done until they had established a new authority to carry out a new scheme. The Board of Education had reversed that progress, and they had stopped the authority which was doing useful work before they had started a new authority to take its place. He hoped the Committee might take it that there was no doubt that the Government would introduce a Hill. Perhaps they would say whether the Hill would be introduced in this or in the other House?</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02082"><member>MR. BRYCE</member><membercontribution> said he would conclude with one piece of advice to the Government. If they desired their Bill to succeed, let them frame it with sole reference to educational considerations, and make it a Bill that should be fair as between the different authorities which were more or less seised of this question, and, above all, let them take every taint of sectarianism out of it. Let there be nothing in the Bill which would arouse those sectarian passions which had so much injured the cause of education, which would impede the passage of the measure, and which would make it more difficult to work. If they would introduce a Bill purely educational, he thought they would have no difficulty in passing it through the House.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02083"><member>EARL PERCY <memberconstituency>(Kensington, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> Protested against the imputation that those who supported the Government's action in this matter were reactionary and opposed to commercial education. He thought that commercial, education was
<col>630</col>
the thing we most needed, probably more than scientific education, and unless it were provided by the Government, or unless the Government provided the means by which that commercial education could be given, we would not retain for long our commercial supremacy in the competition with foreign countries. It by no means followed that they undervalued commercial education because they refused to allow schools to supply it which, by the very essence of their being, were incapable and unfitted to provide it. The hon. Member opposite said that no one would have dreamt when the Minute was discussed in the House that the Government would have placed a construction on it which would prevent the school boards giving commercial education in the schools. He should say that anyone who considered the subject for a moment would see that the Government had no alternative. The Royal Commission on Secondary Education reported that the school boards had already taken the place of what were called by the Schools Inquiry Commission the third grade, and in some cases the second grade schools. The Minute of last year seemed to him to have begun to carry out the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Secondary Education which investigated the subject of these higher grade schools. It laid down the age limit of these schools&#x2014;the age limit was fifteen&#x2014;and by doing so it sharply distinguished these schools from the secondary schools, in which the leaving age was sixteen to nineteen years. The whole object of these higher grade schools was that they should provide scientific training for those who were going into industry or manufacture, while the secondary schools should be open to those who could afford more than one or two years attendance after leaving the ordinary public elementary school, and who could undergo a more general and business training which should fit them to go into a college. The Government had agreed to recognise those schools under the Minute.<lb/>
Surely the wisest policy of the Government in regard to their future Education Bill was to encourage school boards to provide all higher grade science schools which were necesssary for that part of the population which was going to enter
<image src="S4V0090P0I0433"/>
<col>631</col>
into some industry or manufacture; that they should then erect an authority for secondary education which should provide higher grade schools, in which the children should remain for four years, and in which they should have a proper commercial education; and, lastly, that they should provide a regular system of scholarships which should, on the one hand, take the child of the public elementary school to the higher grade organised science school, and, on the other hand, from the public elementary school to the secondary commercial school. When that had been done we would have a thorough businesslike system.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02084"><member>*MR. GEORGE WHITE <memberconstituency>(Norfolk, N.W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he knew it was a somewhat dangerous thing to make any personal reference in first rising to address the Committee, but he wished to say that he had been connected with a large school board for twenty-seven years, and he had for four terms been chairman of that board; he was also a governor of two endowed schools. Therefore he was sure the Committee would pardon him in giving this educational history, because he felt that he had had some opportunity of informing himself in regard to the various phases of educational work, of knowing how they might overlap each other, and how cooperation might be secured with advantage to all.<lb/>
He felt, in rising to support the Amendment, that he was not opposing any grant of public money for the purpose of education. It must be a relief to the Committee, as it was to himself, for a short time at any rate, to get rid of the interminable discussion they bad had upon the war, and the never-ending payments necessary for the cost of the war, and to consider for a few hours matters affecting the condition and the well-being of the people at home. He could not forbear from reminding the Committee that measures of coercion and destruction were far more costly than those of beneficial construction. The prosecution and imprisonment of one Hooligan cost ten times more than an elementary scholar's education. It was a sad and awful thing to feel that when this war should terminate, for the two years it has existed it will have cost
<col>632</col>
more than the whole of the money the State has expended on education since the Act of 1870 was passed. He felt that the House ought to know what plans the Government had for the future with regard to the education of this country, and whether they had any remedy for the chaos the right hon. Gentleman had so graphically described; and especially whether they were prepared to put the higher grade schools on a more permanent footing.<lb/>
He quite supported the distinct allegation that the Department and its work in recent years, so far as education is concerned, had been of a decidedly reactionary character, not only in regard to legislation, but more especially in regard to the administration of the Acts by the Department. There was the best evidence of this in some portions of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman opposite, in which he attempted to show that the work of school boards need not be injured in the least, because they had the technical education grant, or the rate which the technical committees are allowed to raise, to fall back upon to continue their work. Would any hon. Member contend that the technical grant and the technical rate combined were too much for the work which a technical committee had to undertake, whether in cities, boroughs, or rural districts? This was another evidence on the part of the right hon. Gentleman of the way in which the Department attempted to throw the proper work of the school boards on to some other department of educational work. It did not appear to matter to the right hon. Gentleman who took up this work so long as it was taken away from the school boards.<lb/>
He would instance two or three cases of the reactionary policy of the Department. The grant-in-aid of three-quarters of a million of money, and the exemptions of denominational schools from rates began a new principle with regard to the administration of grants in connection with education in this country. It seemed to him, and he thought the working out of it would prove, that the grant-in-aid was really intended to assist inefficient schools, which were doing their work very badly, and at the same time to demand no increased efficiency from them. Until this Govern-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0434"/>
<col>633</col>
ment came into office it was always thought, and acted upon by educationists in connection with school boards, that the school board was the proper authority to supply any acknowledged deficiency of educational accommodation. It had been for this Government to show that that was not so. He could demonstrate over and over again from examples, from large towns as well as from villages, that obstacles had been put in the way of school boards supplying acknowledged deficiencies, where the accommodation had been insufficient and inefficient, and yet delays, extending to years, had been granted until a denominational effort had been made, rather than permit a school board to be established, or an existing board to supply the deficiency. That was a way of administering the Acts which he did not think was in accordance with the spirit of the Education Act of 1870, and certainly was not in accordance with the action of the Department up to the time this Government came into office.<lb/>
It was not only in these ways but in the efforts which were apparently being made to check the character of the education in our midst that the Government had shown their reactionary policy. It was not necessary for him to detain the Committee with the history of the growth of higher grade schools, but he could not follow the right hon. Gentleman opposite in his description of their growth. They were but the natural and simple outgrowth of the Act of 1870. Even that Act gave scope for certain specific subjects, and he believed that before that Act was passed grants were administered from the Education Department for specific subjects, some of which were even in these later days almost dragged into what is called secondary education. It was quite true that school boards and those who were anxious to establish higher grade schools did on many occasions proclaim the hope that these schools would be erected and carried on without expense to the rates. But the right hon. Gentleman argued as though that was a proof that the illegality of these schools was acknowledged. It was nothing of the sort. He himself, as a strong advocate, and perhaps the founder, of the higher grade school in connection with one large school board, when he stood
<col>634</col>
before his fellow citizens expressed the hope that in a few years it would not be a burden on the rates. But he did not express the hope because he felt there was any illegality in taking money from the rates in support of such schools. The growth of the interest of the public in education had been slow, and it was necessary, so to speak, to gild the pill a little in order to induce ordinary citizens to give the thing a chance. Mr. Mundella in the same way said the schools should be self-supporting, but by so saying he did not give the slightest intimation that it was illegal to take money from the rates for their support. Surely it was not contended that the education of to-day should be judged upon the same standard as thirty years ago. Was it to be assumed that the progress of the century was to be marked in everything except our educational work? The hon. Member for West Nottingham said that we appeared to be merely marking time in regard to higher education. He thought we were doing worse, and that in the past five years we had gone back.<lb/>
After a few years experience of the Education Act, the larger school boards began to establish these higher grade schools. Naturally, they found that it tended to economy, and also to efficiency of teaching, to group higher standards in certain schools, and most large towns established these higher grade schools. They were established in order to deal with those children who were capable of following the instruction given in the higher standards, and also those whose parents were willing they should remain at school for a few years longer. He would take the higher grade school at Norwich as an example, and give the concrete history of that school. In the first instance, only a small modicum of science was taught, such as he supposed higher elementary schools were now intended to teach, but they were almost driven by the South Kensington Department to establish a school of science. Therefore, after a few years they established a science school within the higher grade school. He quite agreed that the science schools as then established were too scientific for the curriculum of a popular day school like a higher grade school, and therefore they got relief. The Committee would notice that within
<image src="S4V0090P0I0435"/>
<col>635</col>
two years from that date they had been compelled as a school board to build, in addition to the chemical laboratory which they had in connection with the higher grade school, a physical laboratory, at an expense of &#x00A3;1,000. That had been open only twelve months, and now they were told that all this was illegal, and that they had no right to take any money from the rates for the support of this science school.<lb/>
The matter of age was another point upon which the Education Department had shown a very reactionary tendency. A little time ago 65 per cent, of the boys and girls in our schools left at the age of eleven. The efforts of all educationists had been devoted to getting children to stay longer at school, especially in the higher grade schools. Nothing could be more suicidal than in the face of the progress which was being made to put this block upon our higher education. What reason was there for it? The ratepayers who had to pay had made no public protest against the application of rates to higher grade schools. As one who knew something of the educational work in the big towns of the country, he said that so far as his knowledge went there was no rate more popular or more willingly paid than the, portion which goes to the maintenance of these higher grade schools. He ventured to say that the persons at the bottom of this objection were mainly the head masters of our secondary schools, who had been stirring up the opposition to school board work. Many of these secondary schools were private schools run for private profit. He was somewhat surprised at the attitude of the right hon. Gentleman in comparing the teachers of our higher grade schools and their capacity for giving instruction with the teaching capacity of many of the secondary schoolmasters. It was a sorry thing if the efficiency and thorough training which the best masters in our higher grade schools had had would not compare satisfactorily with that of the secondary schoolmasters, many of whom, although extremely able men, had had no training whatever, so far as the art of teaching was concerned.<lb/>
A great deal had been said which was not strictly accurate with regard to the influence of higher grade schools upon
<col>636</col>
secondary schools. To a very great extent the fears expressed were groundless. If the secondary schools were doing their duty and giving a thoroughly sound education, why should they be afraid of the competition of the higher grade schools? A cry of this kind was raised in his own city some years ago. It was said that one of the schools there was being injured by the influence of the higher grade school. He sifted the facts, and found that not one scholar less attended the school after the higher grade school was opened than attended previously. But he also found that a year and a half before the higher grade school was opened this endowed school had raised its fees, and in consequence the number of boys attending had considerably diminished. That was before the higher grade school was opened, but yet it was popularly supposed in the city that the higher grade school had injured the endowed school to that extent. Grammar schools, many of which confined themselves to a classical education, would always have a separate section of the community supporting them, because class distinction, which, had such influence in the country, would always separate the attendants at the grammar schools from those at the higher grade schools.<lb/>
While there were some who protested against the action of higher grade schools, let him draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that there were very loud protests coming from the great bulk of our organised labour men and artisans against the efforts which were being made to injure the higher grade schools. At labour congresses and trade-union meetings great interest had been excited in this movement, and the right hon. Gentleman would hear from these trade councils that they were determined their children should not be robbed of practically their only chance of securing that education which was necessary to fit them to take their fair position in life. These higher grade schools were the best aids to the technical schools which were being established with such great advantage throughout the country. They were really the groundwork upon which the technical schools might and would be able to build, and instead of restricting their influence
<image src="S4V0090P0I0436"/>
<col>637</col>
in our large towns he would suggest that it the right hon. Gentleman would devise a scheme to extend their influence and advantages to the rural districts he would be doing a great service to the cause of education and to the country at large. The rural districts stood in need of the instruction which the higher grade schools were giving in the more populous districts, and if the right lion. Gentleman would by some scheme or other provide that it should be given he would confer an inestimable advantage upon those districts.<lb/>
The tight hon. Gentleman had laboured a great deal to prove the illegality of the school boards in this matter, but something more would be heard about that when the appeal had been decided. Even if it were demonstrated that their action had all through been illegal, he hoped that the right lion. Gentleman would see tit to provide sonic means by which the higher grade schools might not be injured in the work they were doing. Those behind the scenes did not forget that long before the Cockerton case was before the country there were attacks upon our higher grade schools in one way or another. In 1896 there was an attack in this House, which was afterwards withdrawn, but there had been a sapping and mining going on ever since, which he felt had been a very great injury. First of all, the Science and Art Department, through the Technical Instruction Committee, did their best to limit the work of the present boards and to prevent new boards taking up science teaching. That had been going on for five years, until it has now culminated in an appeal to the law.<lb/>
With regard to the Minute of last April a great deal had been said as to the manner in which it had been administered. It restricted the education and the age, and he did not think that the Committee would be satisfied unless the right hon. Gentleman told them what it was that had kept the Department from recognising more of these higher elementary schools, He believed that in December the right hon. Gentleman said there were several more applications that were on the point of being recognised, and yet to-day we stood at the point of having two&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02086"><member>*MR. GEORGE WHITE</member><membercontribution> said we had reached a dozen in twelve months out of 190 applications, and the Committee was absolutely ignorant of the reasons why the remainder had not been recognised. Rumour had it that all the chaotic condition of education in regard to science and art was caused by the ill-assorted union which had taken place between the Education Department and the Science and Art Department of South Kensington. He did not think a single educationist in the country desired to see the Science and Art Department survive one month longer than it did, but since the union the Education Department had gone back. There was formerly not much fault to be found with the administrative work so far as promptness was concerned, but since the union both Departments appeared to be as bad as the Science and Art Department was previously. He thought the Committee ought to know whether there was any unanimity of feeling and action between the two branches, or whether there was likely to be a divorce again. At present it is like a father and mother who are quarrelling, and are yet determined to live together, to the great detriment of the family they are bringing up.<lb/>
The Committee would appreciate some of the difficulties with which the right hon. Gentleman had to contend in his present position. The right hon. Gentleman himself had said that we had a territorial aristocracy who were very indifferent to the interests of education, and he (Mr. White) had been struck with the cheers coming from hon. Gentlemen opposite when anything was said against the work of the higher grade schools being supported out of the rates. Probably not a few of the hon. Gentlemen opposite had had a great deal of their education from funds which they had not supplied, and he for one was democratic enough to feel for and to press the interests of the working classes being supplied from the rates in regard to higher education such as was given in the higher grade board schools. He hoped the right hon. Gentleman would not be

<image src="S4V0090P0I0437"/>
<col>639</col>
deterred by such influences, especially as he belonged to a Government which included amongst its members the right hon. Gentleman the Colonial Secretary. It was from that right hon. Gentleman and those who sat with him at that time that he got his fullest and best ideals of a national system of education a great many years ago, and, knowing the power he wielded in the, Cabinet, he could not, and the nation would not, exempt him from blame if this state of things continued. He would appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to show the same interest in popular education that he had shown in the earlier part of his political career, and not to allow reactionary ecclesiastical individuals to put back the clock of education, to the great detriment of the commercial and moral interests of the country.<lb/>
One word with regard to the authority of which the right hon. Gentleman had spoken. To his mind the best and most encouraging words delivered by the right hon. Gentleman to-night were the few words with which he concluded his speech in reference to one authority to deal with elementary, secondary, and technical education. He (Mr. White) was an ardent supporter of the school board system, but he was perfectly content to say&#x2014;and he was speaking the sentiments of a great many educationists throughout the country&#x2014;that they were not wedded absolutely to a school board management of these three branches of education. They did not feel that a school board was necessarily the best body that could be elected for the purpose. It was elected for one purpose, and if these additional duties were added it might require reforming in various ways. But he did contend that, whatever the body might be, it should be very largely, if not entirely, an elected body. The people should have a very large voice in its constitution, and then, and only then, would it have the confidence of the people sufficiently to back it in carrying on the great educational work of the country.<lb/>
He could have said a word or two with reference to the influence of these Acts upon the evening schools, but he would forbear. The question was now before the Committee, and he hoped the very emphatic words of the right hon. Gentle-
<col>640</col>
man the Member for Dartford would influence the Governemnt, so that when their Bill was proposed it might be such as all true educationists could support. He was sure he expressed the sentiments of those who felt strongly upon the question of school board education when he said that they would be willing to sacrifice some of their opinions in this matter if they could but see the three systems of education under one popularly-elected body, and that authority administering the Education Acts in an enlightened spirit to the advantage of the community at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02087"><member>MR. HENRY HOBHOUSE <memberconstituency>(Somersetshire, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: All who have listened to this debate with the true interests of education at heart must feel grateful at the unanimity on both sides in favour of educational reform, and at the freedom the discussion has displayed from that thin sectarian and party spirit which is apt to disfigure and delay our educational debates. The friends of the school board system have, not unnaturally, taken an early opportunity of directing attention to the condition of the law, but naturally they have found themselves somewhat in a difficulty in discussing a question which is still <i>sub judice.</i> The London School Board, rightly or wrongly, have decided to appeal to C&#x00E6;sar, to the highest law court of the land, and they have the natural answer of the Government, "Unto C&#x00E6;sar thou hast appealed, and unto C&#x00E6;sar thou must go." I somewhat regret that they have thought it necessary to spend the money of the ratepayers in prolonging this litigation, and consequently to cause considerable delay in the deciding of a question which, after all, is not a matter for the law at all. This is a question with which the Government and this House must ultimately deal, whatever the decision is in the law courts. I think we ought to realise that difficulties have arisen in respect of these higher grade schools principally from the fact that for so many years past we have neglected to deal with this very difficult question of the organisation of the higher education of this country. The school boards, which are no doubt most ambitious and aspiring local bodies, have
<image src="S4V0090P0I0438"/>
<col>641</col>
done their best, and I think it ought to be recorded to their credit that in many of our thickly populated centres they have filled the gap in the educational system which undoubtedly existed. They have, in some places, it may be, interfered and somewhat injured the schools of other institutions, but I think we must all acknowledge that in some places where educational needs are most pressing they have erected a very useful and necessary class of schools.<lb/>
That higher elementary schools, or what some of us regard as secondary schools, are required cannot be denied. Whether it is necessary to make them free or not is another question. I think we must all regret that some of the great school boards should have had recourse to such subterfuges and evasions as the Vice-President of the Council has mentioned just now. But I do not think that any jealousy on the part of local authorities ought to be allowed to retard the completion of our system of education in our huge towns and elsewhere. It has been recognised on the highest authority most emphatically, and with unanimity by the late Commission on Secondary Education, that what was really required was co-ordination between the different local authorities, and this was actually carried out, not by legislation or by the action of the Government&#x2014;although they have done something by the introduction of Clause 7&#x2014;but by voluntary co-ordination and a coming together of the local authorities. The city of Manchester is a very striking example of this, for there the Technical Instruction Committee, the School Board, and the University College have conic together, and they have decided what the limit of their respective jurisdictions should be. They have not spent their time considering how they shall cut into each other, but they have made a point of deciding how to arrange their schools so that they shall not overlap but fit in one with the other. Everybody laments this want of organisation and overlapping, and we have had some very remarkable instances this evening. Ulverston could not get a science school until three different local authorities had been brought into co-operation by the action of the central body. Such a thing is a scandal at the present day. Look at the position
<col>642</col>
of the evening continuation schools in the rural districts. A great many of them have been started by the action of the county councils, but those council have no statutory power to carry them on, and there is some doubt as to whether they are legal. They have had to give large grants of money for the purpose, because otherwise these schools could not exist. Let us take a broad view of this matter and not impure too closely which local authority ought to be entrusted to carry on these schools. As a nation we ought to make up our minds that in this twentieth century it is necessary to have a complete system of national education, and let us have as e few local authorities as possible, and do everything we can to strengthen the hands of the central department.<lb/>
I am asked to vote to-day for a reduction of the salary of the Vice-President of the Council, but as far as I know he is the only gentleman on the front bench who takes any interest at all in this question. There has been a most singular absence to-night of most of the prominent members of the Cabinet. If I had been asked to vote for a reduction of the salary of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I should have been much more ready to have gone into the Opposition lobby, because, after all, many of these educational reforms are believed in and supported by my right hon. friend the Vice-President of the Council; but his difficulty is with the Treasury. The Treasury is not quite as liberal on these educational matters as it is on some matters of reform which are perhaps more popular on this side of the House. I have no doubt that my right hon. friend would have dealt more generously with the Minute if he had had more funds. I cannot think that it is necessary to give these higher grade board schools always a scientific character. We do not want to specialise either as to commercial or scientific education, and I cannot help thinking that in this ease the result of our system of science and art grants is somewhat prejudicial to general education. I hope the Treasury and all other departments of the Government will recognise that in this country education must grow, and the expenses must grow as well. We cannot afford to stand still in this matter. If no other authorities
<image src="S4V0090P0I0439"/>
<col>643</col>
are erected to start schools of this character, then these higher grade elementary schools, or whatever they may be called, which exist largely for the benefit of the working classes and which are demanded by them, arid without which our system of education will not he complete&#x2014;these must be carried on, and, if no I new authority is erected, then the school boards must carry them on. If the Government wish to alter this state of things the sooner they bring in their Education Bill the better. It must take a long time to discuss that measure, and we have already waited too long for it. Every year that passes increases the difficulties rather than diminishes them, and the net result of this debate will be a valuable one if it only convinces this House that legislation is sorely needed in order to bring about the only solution of these difficulties of our educational administration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02088"><member>*MR. DUKE <memberconstituency>(Plymouth)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: As a Member who has a direct interest in this question, owing to the action of the Education Board in my constituency, I would like to join hon. Members who have spoken in pressing upon the Vice-President of the Council the great urgency there is for the introduction of some measure which will put the practical business of education for promising boys and girls of the poorer classes upon something like a business footing. Hon. Gentlemen on the other side have reproached the right hon. Gentleman and the Government with a want of sympathy with the development of the kind of education to which I have referred, because of what has taken place in the testing of the legality of the attitude of the school boards. I venture to suggest to the House that that is a great mistake, for there could not be a stronger evidence s of the necessity of legislation upon this question than the decision in the Cockerton case, and the state of things which that decision showed to exist. For my part, I think the trial of the question in the Cockerton ease has been a great public benefit. I think those who raised the question and challenged the legality of the proceedings of the London School Board did a public service in that respect, because it is not a satisfactory thing that the commercial and business education
<col>644</col>
of a large section of the poorer part of the population should depend upon the tolerant attitude of the Education Department towards that kind of education. I am sure it is not satisfactory to the working classes in the country that that branch of education should depend upon the tolerance of any department of the Government. It must be as a matter of right and as a matter of public administration in the common interest that that branch of education shall be put upon a sound footing. Nobody who knows what has been going on in the higher grade schools will be disposed to say that these schools have not met a public necessity, and that public necessity has been aggravated by the improvement in the provision of elementary education. There was in former years, especially in the towns of the country, a class of schools which the board schools have practically put out of existence, where moderate fees were paid, and where the smaller tradesmen and business men and the better-paid class of artisans sent their children for business education, and got an education of a different kind from that which is now provided in board schools, under the direct personal influence of a class of schoolmasters who practically have now ceased to exist. That class of schools, if not practically driven out of existence, has been diminished very much in number by the severity of the competition which has been produced by the development of the board-school system. Nothing has been provided in its place.<lb/>
One of the aggravating circumstances in regard to the provision of satisfactory business training for hoys of the poorer class is that while you have developed the elementary schools you have done nothing to provide a substitute for those schools which the elementary schools have killed. The frightful condition of commercial education in our towns, as compared with the condition of that in Continental towns, is felt by business men everywhere to be a scandal in this country. One only needs to see the proceedings of chambers of commerce or to meet business men in order to find out the difficulties they have in obtaining satisfactory clerks with business training and commercial knowledge, to feel that the Government is not doing its duty

to a large class of its constituents in this source of great satisfaction to the public respect. We are laying up for ourselves outside as well as to hon. Members in difficulties for the future by provide or to encourage a system of sound commercial education. You have at the present time an excellent system of elementary education for boys who are to be employed in workshops and in industries, and who are not expected to take an active, leading part in those employments; but you are doing nothing for the hoys who are to compete with the hoys of France, Germany, and America in endeavouring to maintain for this country. I will not say a supremacy, but something like an equality in competing for the commerce of the world. It has been shown by the recent decision of the courts that we have done nothing in this country in the way of making proper provision for the aspiring and capable boys of the poorer class, and for this reason one does not need to blame those who have brought forward the question raised in the Cockerton case and brought it to an issue. I regard it as a matter of very little consequence which way the Cockerton decision ultimately goes, provided that this House makes up its mind that the reproach which lies upon our present system of education shall be removed.<lb/>
There was one part of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman which I listened to with great satisfaction, and which seemed to indicate that he might be placed in charge of a measure which would be devoted to sweeping away those delects which now exist in our system of education. If the right hon. Gentleman succeeds in passing such a measure into law he will confer not only a service upon this generation but upon future generations, and he will associate his name with the cause of education in a manner which will please those who know how much he has the cause of education at heart. Hut there was an observation which the right hon. Gentleman made, in answer to a question front the other side of the House, which I must confess disappointed me a little. At present it seems not to be known when or where the proposed measure for this improvement of the educational system will be introduced. I hope that that uncertainty will very speedily be dispelled, and I am sure it would be a
<col>646</col>
source of great satisfaction to the public outside as well as to hon. Members in this House if the right hon. Gentleman would assure the Committee that we shall have certainly in the course of this session, and at a period when it can be fully discussed and its difficulties fully dealt with, a measure which will do something substantial at any rate to remove the confusion which exists in that branch of education which is proposed to he dealt with, and which will supply the link which is missing in our present educational system. One hon. Member has referred to the great expenditure upon the war, and he seemed to regard it as a matter for regret, in view of our educational necessities, that we had spent such great sums in that direction. For my part I am content that we should do all we can to find the money for all our responsibilities. I do not regret that we have spent that money in that direction, but I should regret it if I thought it was possible that people who know what are the necessities of the country at home in respect of this very urgent and pressing matter would be at all discouraged in dealing with this matter because of the obligations we have had to face abroad. I certainly shall not be disposed to vote for the proposal to reduce the right hon. Gentleman's salary, I wish to give the right hon. Gentleman a free hand in the matter, and I hope that when he introduces this Education Bill he will meet with that success which he deserves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02089"><member>MR. LOUGH <memberconstituency>(Islington. W.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: There is only one point to which I desire to draw the attention of the House; it is a matter which was referred to by the hon. Member for North Camberwell, and also by the noble Lord who represents South Kensington. We have listened with interest to the short and able speech made by the noble Lord, and we know he has aright to speak on this question, because he is a London Member. The question I refer to is the treatment of the seventy-nine higher grade schools of London. I disagree with the view which the noble Lord has put before the Committee, and I rise, to support my hon. friend, who has brought forward a most pressing grievance, which is great felt by the people of London, which the right
<image src="S4V0090P0I0441"/>
<col>647</col>
hon. Gentleman opposite could settle, I believe, in the way we desire, and I hope he will make an announcement on the subject before the debate closes. The noble Lord said that the Board of Education was perfectly right in this matter, because the maintenance of the seventy-nine, higher grade schools would interfere with secondary education as it exists at the present time, and that it would interfere with the schools which are to be created. This is an entire mistake, for these schools are provided only for young people between the ages of twelve and fifteen. When a child passes the fifteenth year he must be taken away from these schools. The second grade schools deal with young people between the ages of sixteen and nineteen years, therefore there is no conflict between the two. We heard with a great deal of pleasure the able speeches delivered from the benches opposite, and we hope to hear many more speeches in the same spirit from the same quarter during this debate. The hon. Member who has just sat down dealt with the question of the necessity of securing a better commercial education for the children. These seventy-nine schools were intended to give a commercial training. In November, 1898, one of the Government inspectors said, in regard to one of these schools which was about to be opened, that it should be designed not only with a view to provide for science and art, but also for the teaching of modern languages and for giving a commercial training. That was in the year 1898, and that is the opinion of one of the inspectors of the Board of Education. On the 2nd of March, 1899, there was a Memorandum sent out, which drew attention to two points&#x2014;namely, the lack of commercial training, and the inadequate amount of time which was given to the only modern language taken. Those recommendations came from the Education Department itself. At that time the Education Department were urging schools to give a commercial education, and now they were taking away the grant because those schools had done this. The noble Lord who represents South Kensington said that it was more desirable to give a science and art training than to give this commercial training,
<col>648</col>
because it would be a much better preparation for an industrial or manufacturing career for boys and girls who Would ultimately assist in those industries. But in London the great industry is commerce. That is our chief industry, and while we agree that in Manchester and other manufacturing cities the schools should provide the special training which the children want in those districts, surely we have a right to claim that in London commercial education is an absolute necessity for the children. I do not see how this could have been made the ground by the Education Department for the withdrawal of these grants. On the 27th of July last, in this House. I put a question to the right hon. Gentleman, and I got a very long answer to that question.<sup>*</sup> I then put a supplementary question, in which I asked him in how many of these seventy-nine schools he was prepared to pay the higher grants asked for by the London School Board, and the right hon. Gentleman replied, "Not one; the curriculum is of a commercial and not of a scientific nature." Therefore, for giving this commercial education all these schools are to be fined, and all the work of the London School Board in this direction is to be Upset. I will give another illustration. Shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping have been taken up, because it was thought that an effort should be made to fit out these young people in these branches, because there was a greater demand for them; but the Education Department has singled out the London School Hoard for persecution, and it has done what it can to destroy these schools.</membercontribution></p>

I asked the right hon. Gentleman to deal with the Minute, and he said he would deal with it presently, and later on he made a most apologetic, reference to it. The right hon. Gentleman admitted that there is a loss of &#x00A3;4,000 a year in London on the operation of this system, and he

<image src="S4V0090P0I0442"/>
<col>649</col>
minimises the seriousness of that loss by saying that it was only one thirty-seventh part of a penny. The Vice-President of the Council appeared to apologise for the treatment London has received in respect of commercial education; but why does lie, pursue that treatment? This is not a question of the amount of money, but it is the spirit of the Board of Education that the people protest against. You may say what you like about the Code, but I think that shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping should not be classed as scientific or artistic education. I hardly know where the line can be drawn between these things, and it does seem to me to be straining a point very much, first of all to urge these schools to teach these subjects, and then fine them because they have done so. We have had three elections recently&#x2014;the General Election, the School Board, and the County Council election&#x2014;and I noticed that the people were moved as much by the treatment of these seventy-nine schools as by any other question that was presented to them. "We have been reminded that there are already seventy-nine of these schools, but that means only one school for every hundred thousand of the population. These are higher grade schools, and they should not be mixed up with the secondary schools. I want to press this question on behalf of London absolutely home on the right hon. Gentleman. We are, reminded by the First Lord of the Treasury that we have twenty-three days to criticise the Government, but I venture to observe that most of that time is wasted, because our criticism is generally perfectly barren. Perhaps to-day we shall waste from half-past four to twelve o'clock to-night criticising the policy of the Government. This is a matter which is entirely at the disposal of the right hon. Gentleman.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman will be in a position to say after this debate that he was compelled by the House of Commons to yield upon this question. Are our representations to meet with no response whatever upon
<col>650</col>
a practical question of this kind when there is an almost unanimous opinion expressed on both sides of the House? I will conclude by simply asking the right hon. Gentleman to consider during the remainder of the debate these points on behalf of London, and one way or another to try to do something to save from extinction these seventy-nine schools, which are doing a most useful work in the Metropolis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02094"><member>*MR. TULLY <memberconstituency>(Leitrim, S.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the debate had shown very clearly the great dissatisfaction of the country at the present state of education in this country.<lb/>
Attention called to the fact that forty Members were not present. House, counted, and forty Members being found present&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02095"><member>*MR. TULLY</member><membercontribution> (resuming) said that serious complaints bad been heard from both sides of the House, so that it must be a difficult thing for the right hon. Gentleman the Vice-President to perceive where he, had a friend. But when hon. Gentlemen lodged these complaints ought not they to consider whether they were not equally responsible for what had happened? Much of the trouble arose from the fact that many hon. Gentlemen desired to exclude the religious element from the teaching, whilst others desired to include it. A great deal had been said about the necessity for higher education, but it appeared to him that what was really required was a, good sound commercial education, which according to many of the experts who had spoken upon the question was not given to the people of this country. Typewriting, shorthand, and modern languages were all branches of higher elementary education, and if this country was to attain the educational level of Germany, France, and America, all these subjects would have to be taken up. In Germany particularly most people knew one modern language besides their own, and the neglect to teach modern languages in this country was very disadvantageous to the people. The present state of education was largely due to the persistent endeavour to drive religion out of the schools, and that had militated with special force against the Irish, who by bad
<image src="S4V0090P0I0443"/>
<col>651</col>
government had been driven from Ireland to seek their livelihood in England, and who had had to provide voluntary schools for their children. Such schools, supported only by the voluntary subscriptions of an indigent people, could not hope to compete with board schools maintained out of the rates&#x2014;to which these people also had to pay their share&#x2014;and consequently the children of these poor people were unable to obtain the advantages to which they were entitled. The religious aspect of the question had been definitely settled in Germany, where there was a large Catholic population living side by side with a Protestant population. The schools in each district taught the religion of the district, and unless a similar system were adopted here, England would never obtain the same educational level as her greatest competitor.<lb/>
The complaint which he had to make was the unfair way in which the Irish were treated in this matter, and it was for that reason he protested against the Vote. In any scheme that was put forward he hoped some steps would be taken to put the Irish children in this country on the same level as the English children, and that the attempt which was made in this intolerant manner to keep the Irish children down would cease.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02096"><member>MR. RICHARDS <memberconstituency>(Finsbury, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said, speaking from an experience of twenty years on the subject of secondary education, the plan which he wished to see adopted as far as possible in this country was the German, which recognised primary, secondary, and, finally, university education. That was the educational ladder which he wished to see erected by the Government. He protested against handing over to school boards the work of secondary education, for which they were not created and for which they were not fitted. He was satisfied that by pursuing the policy of either taking the town council in county boroughs or the county council in counties, or representatives of those bodies, as the educational authority, the Government were more likely to solve the educational problem than by allowing school boards to include in their curriculum subjects which were essentially within the domain
<col>652</col>
of secondary education. The majority of school boards, especially in rural districts, were returned, hot on educational questions, but as the result of battles between Church and the intolerance of dissent. What had been said with regard to Germany was absolutely true. They had satisfactorily solved the religious difficulty in the manner suggested, and no educational difficulty resulted.<lb/>
The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk had spoken of the necessity for some authority for evening continuation schools; with that he quite agreed. He remembered once being told that a great deal of money was wasted in evening continuation schools, but the London School Board had shown that that was a fallacy. He, for one, did not grudge the money spent on the education of those who were prepared to give up their time after business to improve their position on the educational ladder. He appealed to the Government not to allow the school boards to run in opposition to the higher educational colleges established in various parts of the country, and to teach in their curriculum subjects of secondary education. He was sure it would be for the benefit of education that the work of primary education should be retained for the school boards only. Of course, he was not for a moment suggesting that the primary schools should direct their attention to primary education only. We were in need of a real system of commercial education, and that could not be obtained by what were called continuation classes. He was quite prepared to admit that they could deal with subjects which would lead to the commercial school, but they could only deal with them as specific subjects, and not on what he called the higher level of commercial education. We ought to follow the German plan, and he would recommend hon. Members to read the report of the Committee of the London County Council on technical education. Anyone who studied that report would master the systems of two or three Conthiental nations, and, he thought, would come to the conclusion that the German system was the best. We should establish in each of our large towns a system of commercial education, taking sixteen as
<image src="S4V0090P0I0444"/>
<col>653</col>
the lowest age, and going up to nineteen, or even later&#x2014;a three years system. He said, unhesitatingly, that was not work for any of the school boards, but for another authority. He knew one parish in Cornwall where it was actually charged against the clergyman of the parish that an effort he made to provide secondary education was only another attempt to win young men for the Church. It only showed the depth to which the sectarian spirit which was abroad in these educational matters would descend. He knew another case where a clergyman established a higher grade school in a cathedral city, and the proposal that the local authority should make a grant to the school for the teaching of technical subjects was opposed on the ground that it might be an injustice to the Nonconformists, as if it could possibly matter in the teaching of chemistry whether the children were taught by a Pagan or a Hottentot. Such was the blindness of the supporters of hon. Members on the other side that they would pursue any policy of opposition to a secondary school which had an ecclesiastical flavour about it. Until we realised that religious matters should be shut outside the educational purview we should never get on with such a system. He knew that the hon. Member for Camberwell had been attacked for his liberal views on education. He hoped the hon. Member would show that he was willing to place those broad views at the disposal of his party, and support any real scheme which the Government might bring forward. He was sure they would carry it if they remembered that in primary education they bad no wish to displace the present authority.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02097"><member>MR. ALFRED HUTTON <memberconstituency>(Yorkshire, W.R., Morley)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said the last two speeches must have cheered the spirit of the Vice-President, as they had introduced for the first time the religious and theological difficulty. The hon. Member for East Finsbury told them that Liberals and Nonconformists only sought positions on school boards in order to put an end to voluntary schools. He never knew that before. Supposing that they succeeded in getting on the boards, they were absolutely unable to achieve that object. He had always thought that "the boot was on the other leg," and
<col>654</col>
that the object of the supporters of voluntary schools was, as a rule, to try to put a stop to the school boards, in order to put an end to the authority of the people.<lb/>
This debate was initiated by the hon. Member for West Nottingham on a different question altogether. The matters they had had under discussion related largely to the higher grade schools. The right hon. Gentleman the Vice-President of the Council was face to face with a strong feeling in the country. It was not a party feeling. On this question there was no party view. They had men of all parties. He thought the conclusion it which they had arrived in regard to the administration of the higher grade schools for the past twelve months was that it had been absurd. The right hon. Gentleman in the early part of his speech dealt with the illegality of the uglier grade schools.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02098"><member>SIR. J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. I did not say that the schools were illegal. What I said was hat the spending of the rates on them vas illegal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02099"><member>MR. ALFRED HUTTON</member><membercontribution> said he perfectly understood the distinction. Of course, it was the spending of rates upon them that was illegal. The right hon. Gentleman told them two ways to get out of the difficulty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02100"><member>SIR. J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: Three ways.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02101"><member>MR. ALFRED HUTTON</member><membercontribution> said he only remembered two at the moment. The first was that the school board could come to an arrangement with the local authority. The local authority had two funds at its disposal. He would ask the right hon. Gentleman, supposing the local authority bad already quite sufficient engagements to meet without increasing its contribution to the school board, what was to be the position of the school board in that case? Every one of the towns instanced by the right hon. Gentleman was comparatively small in area. Take Bradford, Halifax, and Huddersfield&#x2014;he believed in all these three towns the county council or town council had undertaken the control and management of the technical school. If a school board went to these authorities and told them that they were in duty bound to maintain the higher grade schools, he
<image src="S4V0090P0I0445"/>
<col>655</col>
was afraid they would be disposed to reply that they would take their own course and see to the efficiency of their own school. The town councils of Bradford and Leeds had other engagements. They gave large contributions to the Church Institute classes. Would the right hon. Gentleman defend the withdrawing of the grants from those classes in order that the higher education schools might be maintained? It was absolutely hopeless that these schools could be maintained efficiently. These urban authorities had not the resources free and at liberty, and having sufficient engagements at present they could not assist the, school board to maintain the higher grade schools. The only other solution suggested by the right hon. Gentleman which he could recollect was private subscription.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02102"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: I said they could charge fees, as they did in the early stages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02103"><member>MR. ALFRED HUTTON</member><membercontribution> thought the answer to that was that having once abolished fees it would be exceedingly difficult to put them on again. He did not think it would be possible to reinstate them. The third course was the Minute. When the light hon. Gentleman explained the Minute to the House of Commons a year ago,<sup>*</sup> they were told, notwithstanding all the criticisms which they ventured to offer, that the Department were making a proposal which they honestly intended should he used in the maintenance of the efficiency of the schools. He should like to read the concluding portion of the speech of the right hon. Gentleman, it was so very much to the point.
<quote>"Now I hope that the House will believe that this Code and this Minute, which are so heartily approved by the Opposition, have been conceived with a desire to advance the elementary education of the country; that this scheme is the result of careful consideration and consultation with the best authorities available; and that the Board of Education believes that it can be carried into practical and useful effect. I hope the House will also believe that the Board of Education will watch the operation of this new policy and will be ready at once to make amendments wherever experience proves that amendments are necessary."</quote>
The Department had refused every time to vary the conditions it had laid down.

<col>656</col>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02104"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: They cannot vary the Minute without laying a fresh Minute before the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02105"><member>MR. ALFRED HUTTON</member><membercontribution> said it was rather significant that the Department had always replied in the stereotyped phrase that they could not possibly hold out any hope that any changes would be made in the Minute under which the application had been made. The right hon. Gentleman went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"I trust the House will not reject the scheme put forward by Her Majesty's Government because there are two or three provisions in it of a purely detail character which may not in all respects accord with the notions of some hon. Gentlemen opposite."</quote>
There were numerous cases in which amendments had been named, and in every case the Department had replied that they could not possibly consider any alteration in the Minute. He thought they had done worse. They had interpreted the Minute in a way that nobody could possibly have anticipated. He was perfectly aware that for many years in this country we were wofully behind other countries in matters of scientific teaching. Now we were having science run mad. Nothing but science would receive any consideration from the Government. If any other proposal was made they denied any grant or recognition at all. He fully expected when the new Code came up that they would have a regulation that no infant school would be recognised unless it was supplied with proper arrangements for the teaching of elementary science. The school hoards were seeking to have something in addition, or some option, but the right hon. Gentleman was doing his best to deny it. They were not asking the right hon. Gentleman to establish a new type of school; they simply asked for some latitude; and what were the excuses offered for refusing this? In one case the Department replied that they could not recognise the curriculum proposed by the school board, because they found in it book-keeping, shorthand, and business training. But the extraordinary thing was that while the Department refused to recognise in the curriculum of the higher grade school book-keeping and shorthand, those subjects could actually be taught under the Code in the elementary schools. The Department replied that these were to be considered
<image src="S4V0090P0I0446"/>
<col>657</col>
outside the scope of the higher grade schools, which were to be confined to the teaching of elementary science, He thought he might say that very few boards would ever consent to bring their schools under the Minute unless some of the conditions were altered. To bring them under the Minute would be to degrade the education given, and if a hoard would consent to do that, he did not think their majority would be the same after the next election. People in the large towns were proud of these schools, and they were not going to have them degraded by having them brought under the grant-earning Minute which the right hon. Gentleman brought before Parliament with the promise that it would be elastic.<lb/>
The right hon. Gentleman made one remark which he thought very unfortunate. He said the school boards were trying to make themselves the authority for secondary education. The right hon. Gentleman had no justification whatever for that statement. The hon. Member ventured to state that there was not a school board in the country that had the slightest ambition to make itself the authority for secondary education. Whether that were so or not, he felt hound to say, by way of warning the right hon. Gentleman, that in fixing upon some new authority he would he unwise to select either of the two antagonistic bodies at present in existence&#x2014;the school boards and the technical instruction committees of the county councils. They were, rather jealous of one another. If the right hon. Gentleman were wise, he would create some authority which would not partake of favouring either of these disputants for the honour of having charge and control of secondary education. That would prevent jealousy, and put an end to the search for some line of demarcation between elementary and secondary education. If the Government were going to pursue that will-o'-the-wisp, they would never settle education. No line of demarcation could be found.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02107"><member>MR. ALFRED HUTTON</member><membercontribution> said he was very glad the right hon. Gentleman cheered that statement, because they had had the Duke of Devonshire repeatedly saying that the Department was seeking
<col>658</col>
a line of demarcation. He maintained that it was impossible to find one. The Department, knowing it could not find it in the curriculum, was seeking for it in the age of the students, but that was e equally impossible. The only way to avoid tie difficulty was to establish one authority with which all could fall into line, and which would be acceptable to the friends of the technical instruction committees on the one hand, and to the school boards on the other.</membercontribution></p>

Gentleman filled me with deep regret. There was only one statement with which I found myself in complete agreement, and that was the statement with which he closed his speech in reference to the necessity for having one authority con-rolling all forms of education. Even with regard to that his view is apparently not the view of the Government, as he says the Government is to introduce a Bill upon which the House will have an opportunity of settling this question without the guidance of the Government. The Bill is to be introduced in such a form that the House shall settle for itself&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02109"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: I said nothing of the kind.

<p id="S4V0090P0-02110"><member>*MR. GRAY</member><membercontribution>: If Parliament is to have an opportunity of raising the questions, that generally implies that the questions are not in the Bill when it is introduced.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02112"><member>*MR. GRAY</member><membercontribution>: I am glad my right hon. friend excludes that interpretation. I should be much more satisfied it the Government will screw up its courage at last, and come down with a scheme of one authority for all forms of education. I use the words "screw up its courage" advisedly, because although we were told in 1896 that this thing was essential, and in 1897 that the Bills they introduced were patching measures, designed to prepare the way for a final scheme of reform, yet the years which have since elapsed have witnessed no progress in the move-

<col>659</col>
ment inside the House, while the country outside is clamouring for a settlement. Year after year, on the Education Estimates, the Vice-President of the Council declares that this thing is necessary, and I am driven to the conclusion that it is simply on account of lack of courage on the part of the Government that we do not get the measure.<lb/>
The speech of the right hon. Gentleman to-night filled me with surprise. I understood that the object of this debate was to obtain from the Vice-President a clear interpretation of the policy of his Department with regard to the Higher Elementary Minute. He failed to give any such interpretation. That policy has been inconsistent from the first day to the last. Will the light hon. Gentleman himself get up and defend it? I think not. Can he explain the principles upon, which the Department is acting now? The explanation he gave at the commencement of this debate is totally different from the explanation, put before the Committee when the Minute was before us. Is he not aware that amongst these school boards, a large number of which are composed of Church people, with majorities of what are called "Moderates," as well as among all people interested in the education of the children, there is a feeling of deep anxiety as to what he would say this evening with regard to higher elementary schools. They started in May last with considerable hope; they saw a prospect of the schools called higher elementary schools being legalised. We were told that the object of this Minute was to legalise these particular schools. To-day we are told that it was in order that the organised science schools might be safeguarded in view of the possible decision of the courts in the Cockerton case.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02114"><member>*MR. GRAY</member><membercontribution>: The right hon. Gentleman says that is what he said in May last. Perhaps I may venture to quote. What was the difficulty in May last? I was present throughout the whole of the debate, and the circumstances are very vividly before my mind. The block grant had been introduced, and that lobby was full of gentlemen who were trying to get the Government to withdraw the block grant on account
<col>660</col>
of the mischief it was said it would inflict upon certain of the higher class schools. That block grant was in jeopardy; it was saved by the introduction of the Minute. The hon. Member for Cambridge University coupled the block grant of the Code with the Higher Elementary Minute in one and the same motion, and we went through the lobby in support of the Government on the double question&#x2014;the Higher Elementary Minute, the natural corollary of the introduction of the block grant. The block grant did not inflict the slightest shadow of loss or injustice upon the higher grade schools. It did not touch the higher grade schools by so much as the, one-thirty-seventh of a penny at which the right hon. Gentleman estimates the injury in certain large towns. That one-thirty-seventh of a penny is not a very great loss to the ratepayers, but it represents a very large loss indeed to the 200 or 300 children who would have taken advantage of it, not only in board schools but in voluntary schools also. What are the facts of the case? The hon. Member for Cambridge University used these words&#x2014;
<quote>"It is also objected that the 22s. grant&#x2014;"</quote>
that is, the new block grant&#x2014;
<quote>"did not adequately reward those schools which have hitherto been teaching some higher subjects over and above the ordinary elementary work."</quote>
That is not, the higher grade schools.
<quote>"Such schools, which may have been earning a 25s. or 27s. grant, will be losers."</quote>
Those are not higher grade schools; they are the higher standard schools, the higher divisions in some of the schools where a grant of 25s. or 27s. had been earned before the introduction of the block grant. He went on to say&#x2014;
<quote>"These schools may be obliged to give up their higher teaching."</quote>
Now mark the next statement:
<quote>"If the Code stood alone that objection would have force. But the new Code has been supplemented by the Minute of the Board of Education of April last,"</quote>
supplemented, as he went on to explain, to meet the very case of these higher standard schools where a grant of 27s. had been earned in the past, and not to meet the case, of the higher grade schools at all. The right hon. Gentleman may say that he is not responsible in any way for what his colleague in the representa-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0448"/>
<col>661</col>
tion of Cambridge University may say. Unfortunately for that line of argument, in his own speech the right hon. Gentleman says&#x2014;
<quote>"I think the very lucid and clear exposition of the Code and Minute by my hon. friend and colleague the Member for the University of Cambridge would have put Members of the House of Commons in possession of all the views of the Government upon this subject."</quote>
I have always regarded that, as I am sure the great majority of Members on both sides of the House in the last Parliament also regarded it, as fathering the exposition of policy given by the hon. Member for Cambridge University. It was perfectly clear to all of its that this Higher Elementary Minute was to meet the case of the schools which were to be hit by the introduction of the block grant. But what do we hear to-night? That it is not to meet the case of those schools, but the case of the higher grade schools. In the early part of his speech the right hon. Gentleman said there were two or three forms of higher grade schools. He went on to explain that there was the form in which the teaching of the ordinary Code subjects was followed, and that there was a large number of these schools. These were not organised schools of science; they taught the ordinary subjects of the Day School Code; and then he said, "These can go on." He dismissed them in the most airy fashion. I want to know how they are to go on without the money they are expecting to get out of this Higher Elementary Minute. These schools were, from the point of view of the ratepayers, and also from the public point of view, not only necessary but carried on on the most economical lines. What can be more ruinous than to have three or four children in one school, half a dozen in another, and a dozen in another, stopping for two or three years, demanding the attention of special teachers, and being taught special subjects? What can be more expensive than a system of that sort? These higher standard schools took all these children and grouped them together in one school, devoted the whole of their teaching to upper standard work, and relied on getting the higher grant of 27s. per child. These schools could not continue to exist, when the block grant system was introduced, but for the safeguard of the Higher Elementary
<col>662</col>
Minute. To-night we learn that these schools are not to look for any hope under the Higher Elementary Minute. They are not to continue the work they have been doing for years their only chance of getting assistance from the central treasury is by becoming organised schools of science. Nothing can be more disastrous than to try to cast the whole of these schools into one mould. I always thought these higher elementary schools were to resemble <i>Les Ecoles Primaires Sup&#x00E9;rieures</i> in France, with their three years course, and that the children stopping two or three years would take just those subjects which would fit them for the walk they were going to follow in after life. They can specialist at that age to some extent. I have seen the schools in excellent working order&#x2014;</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02115"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: In France?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02116"><member>*MR. GRAY</member><membercontribution>: Yes, in France. I spent several days only a fortnight ago in some of these French schools; they were doing good work, and, as far as one could judge in a rapid glance, producing excellent results. They were not insisting on all the children following a scientific course in the first year. In the first year the children all take the same general line of study; in the second year they are divided into three sections&#x2014;the literary, the industrial, and the commercial; and in the third year they mark still more emphatically the amount of time they should spend in the year on either industrial, commercial, or literary subjects, according to the walk of life they are going to follow later. It may be said that that is specialising at too early an age. But the great majority of those children will never go a step further; they are going to leave educational work when they have finished their course at the school. If they have no chance of specialising before leaving what are they to do? In Bradford they want the boys in their offices as commercial clerks; where are they to get the early stages of their training? According to the policy of the Board of Education they are to get it in the school of science.&#x2014;[AN HON. MEMBER: There is an excellent grammar school in Bradford.]&#x2014;Yes, at which fees must be paid, and in which the greater portion of the study is not commercial
<image src="S4V0090P0I0449"/>
<col>663</col>
but literary, from which the children may come out with a good literary education, and yet be only fitted to starve as clerks at &#x00A3;50 a year. I want to see introduced in our English schools a system of training which will induce the children to look upon manual labour as an honourable calling. But you do not get it by making all the schools organised science schools. Why should you not have book-keeping for a lad thirteen or fourteen years old? If you have an advanced course of organic chemistry, why not a course in French or some other modern language? Are all these children going to earn their living in the manufacturing departments of the State? Are they all going to be mechanics? We are training a large number of our children in the primary schools to do the manufacturing of the article, but we are training hardly one for the distribution of the article when made. All over the country merchants are lamenting this defect in our national system of education. It would be all very well to talk about specialising at a later date, that it could be postponed until the children got to the secondary schools, but for the one fact that a very large percentage, of the children can never have an opportunity of going to a secondary school, and unless there is something in the way of specialisation in these schools you have not only done no good to those children, but you have done them a great deal of harm. You ought to be able to judge at fourteen years of age what the parent proposes to do with, the child. In some schools I have visited the head teacher's time is largely occupied in advising parents as to the walk of life a child should follow, having carefully noted the aptitudes of the child in school and the liking it has for special branches of study. I thought we were going to have under the Higher Elementary Minute schools of the description I have mentioned; the very name encouraged that hope. Now we are told it is to safeguard the higher grade schools.<lb/>
I should like to go a step further with regard to these higher elementary schools. It has been argued all the evening as if none but school boards were able to establish these schools. What about half the children of the country? What
<col>664</col>
about the 2,600,000 children who are still attending voluntary schools? Are these to have no opportunity whatever? Said the Vice-President very airily, "These schools can go on." Yes, legally they can go on, but they cannot go on without the necessary money. If the right hon. Gentleman withdraws the support of this Higher Elementary Minute, these schools must of necessity close their doors. As far as voluntary schools are concerned, there are two courses open: to transfer their children to the board schools and seek the support of the rates, in order to keep the higher elementary school going, or to abandon all hope of a child attending a voluntary school getting this slightly higher form of education. I beseech the Committee not to run away with the idea that this is secondary school training. Go into the schools and see them at work; look at the work in the higher elementary schools across the water; judge for yourselves whether that is secondary school work. Recollect the homes these children come from, their limited vocabulary when they start, the difficulties they have to contend with. It is absurd to suggest, except in a very few cases indeed, that anything in the nature of real secondary education can be given to such children before the ago of fifteen. The Swiss would laugh at the idea of this being secondary education. They look upon it as an essential feature of their primary school life. In many countries they would refuse to let the child leave school earlier, insisting on the whole burden of its education being thrown upon the State, and insisting upon the child staying at school until it had passed through this course in the higher elementary school.<lb/>
Now I turn for one moment to the question of the higher grade schools&#x2014;the organised science schools. I hope the right hon. Gentleman did not intend to leave the impression, but I am bound to say he left it on my mind, that these schools had been established by fraud. We had case after case quoted where school boards had applied for loans to build schools, giving an assurance that they were to be elementary schools and organised science, schools, and then, having obtained the loans on these conditions, they used the school solely as an
<image src="S4V0090P0I0450"/>
<col>665</col>
organised science school. It sounded very much like a charge of fraud, of obtaining loans under false pretences. I hope the right hon. Gentleman did not intend to convey that impression; but, if so, if these school boards were fraudulent in their intentions, the Hoard of Education connived at the fraud, aided and abetted it, published documents, quasi-official, encouraging boards to carry on this work, suggesting to them that it was their obvious duty to establish these schools; and I believe I have been out with some of the officials of the Department to the opening of higher grade schools, when no words could be too flattering of the authority for the excellent way in which they were discharging their public duty. I have heard it over and over again, and I agree with the flattery, or rather the praise; I agree that these authorities are doing their duty. If they were not, what would the ratepayers have done with them at the next election? They would have thrown them out of office. These are popularly-elected bodies. One would imagine that they were bodies which held office contrary to the wishes of the local ratepayers. The establishment of the great majority of these higher grade schools has been the subject of keen criticism and contest at school board elections. The people, if any, to condemn are not the members of the school board, but the electors who put them into office. The electors are primarily responsible for every higher grade school in existence.<lb/>
When the Vice-President was referring to these schools he gave us one or two instances in which he said these loans had been obtained under false pretences&#x2014;cases in which, having obtained the loan, they then established a science school. Somebody asked him to give the figures showing the proportion of science and elementary scholars respectively in the school. I will give the figures in one or two instances. I believe one of the schools referred was at Hanley, where under the conditions set forth the school was established, and, said the right lion. Gentleman, "What did they do? There were 309 scholars receiving scientific instruction in that school" Perfectly true; but I think he ought to have added that in the same building there were 279 children receiv-
<col>666</col>
ing the ordinary elementary instruction. Therefore it seems to me that they were fairly keeping the conditions. Another case mentioned was that at Leeds, in which the conditions were laid down and said to be violated, and we were told there were no less than 204 scholars taking the scientific course. Yes, but surely we ought to have been told that in addition there were in the same building no less that 737 children taking the ordinary elementary school course. Therefore, I suggest that the conditions under which the loans were obtained were not violated. If I take the total of fifty-nine of these so-called organised science schools, I find 11,800 scholars in the science section, and no less than 26,099 in the elementary section, so that the great majority of the scholars are still doing the ordinary elementary school work, and the remainder are taking the scientific course.<lb/>
I do not propose to weary the Committee except with one word more. I am tired of trying to get any progress in the administration of the Department. What do I find? Why, at the General Election a few months ago Member after Member, on this side of the House as well as on that, set forth in paragraph after paragraph their desire to see rapid progress in popular education. Speeches were made by Conservative and Unionist candidates, in favour generally of the Imperialistic policy of the Government; but if the word "education" were ejaculated by some enthusiast in the meeting the reply was&#x2014;"Yes, I am all in favour of progress in popular education." No sooner do we get in this Chamber than the desire to see progress vanishes. [Ministerial cries of "Oh, oh."] Well, if the desire for progress in this matter has not evaporated, then I hope that hon. Members will soon have an opportunity of showing their zeal. This debate tonight has been worth the having if only for the speech which we have heard from the right hon. Member for Dart-ford. But what he has said in the House to-night on this question has been said here and in the country scores of times, and yet we cannot get this question settled. Public meetings attended by the clergy and the bishops of the Church have all clamoured for this reform, and voluntary school managers declare that in spite of all their endeavours
<image src="S4V0090P0I0451"/>
<col>667</col>
in the past few years they cannot keep going much longer. Only yesterday another case came into my hands of a London school which was shut up because it was found impossible to carry it on any longer. The same cry is coming from one end of the country to the other. Owing to the vacillating policy of the Education Department we do not know what next year may bring. It has been said that it is necessary to draw a clear line of demarcation between primary and secondary schools, but you would not need that if you had one local authority. A great waste of money, waste of effort, and waste of time is characterising the existing system. There is needless overlapping, and a struggle is going on between the secondary and technical authorities and the school board and the voluntary schools for the body of the same child, in order to drag that child into this and that school simply to get the grant per head that is paid by the State. If Parliament will but give ns a single educational authority in each county council area, that local authority will take precious good care that there is none of this overlapping. Such a reform would destroy three-fourths of the existing jealousies, for it would then be nobody's interest to keep a child in a particular school, but it would be everybody's interest to put a child in that school in which it would be best taught.<lb/>
I am appealing for no one sect, but for the training of these children upon whom the future of this great Empire depends. There is a, great commercial contest going on between the great nations, and you are doing nothing to meet it. We know how much the intelligence of a battalion affects results on the battle field, and we hear that it is necessary that our soldiers should be better trained. Why not give them this chance in the day school? Why should those parents who want to keep their children at school until they are fifteen years of age not have the chance of doing so? At all events, if the locality is prepared to do this, do not let the Government hinder them, and if their action happens to be illegal, then I say that it is the first duty of the Government to come to Parliament for that legislation which will enable a locality to carry out its own desire.</membercontribution></p>

<col>668</col>
of the House to the summary dismissal of teachers without them having any opportunities of appeal or any chance of reinstatement. I remember that in the last session of Parliament, in the year 1900, I put a question to the right hon. Gentleman the Vice-President of the Council, asking him if he would bring in a Bill making the Board of Education the final court of appeal in such matters as this. I remember that he promised then to bring in a Bill the following session. Then there came the General Election, and in the short session of December last I put down another question, and he promised me another Bill this session. And I am sorry to say that when a question was put the other night he gave the same rather evasive answer. My reason for rising to-night is simply and solely to ask him to regard this matter as one of pure justice and not as a party question.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02119"><member>SIR JOSEPH LEESE</member><membercontribution>: I said "a rather evasive answer," but I will withdraw it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02120"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: I said that my noble friend the Lord President of the Council in December last authorised me to say that the matter would be dealt with in the present session. My noble friend is still of the same mind. The matter will be dealt with, but whether it will be dealt with by minute or legislation is still under consideration. My hon. friend the Member for West Ham accused me of saying one thing last year and another thing this year. The only way to defend myself against this charge is to inflict upon the Committee a passage from a speech which I made on. 3rd May, 1890. I then said&#x2014;
<quote>"You have school boards who have established excellent higher-grade schools, whose work I have always spoken of in terms of the highest eulogy, end school hoards are now supporting those schools in an illegal manner out of the school funds. What, then, is to he done? This Minute affords an opportunity of placing these schools on a legal and legitimate footing, and although there may he some higher-grade schools which will stand out and take the chance of the law courts, yet I believe the great majority of these schools have hailed with satisfaction the publication of this Minute, and that they will convert themselves into higher elementary schools so as to put their proceedings on a proper and legitimate footing."</quote>
<image src="S4V0090P0I0452"/>
<col>669</col>
The majority of the great school boards boycotted the Higher Education Minute and resolved, particularly as the Science and Art Department were continuing to pay the grants, to wait for the final judgment. A few of the boards have come in, and Sheffield and Salford and some others have converted their schools into higher elementary schools; but the majority of the boards are holding out until the final judgment, and then I have no doubt that a very large number of them will come in.<lb/>
The hon. Member for Halifax asked me three questions. The first was why 17s. 6d. was still imposed upon evening continuation schools. That is a question for the Treasury, and not for the Board of Education. With regard to the question of the attendance of children at evening continuation schools, I will do everything in my power to make regulations by which the evening continuation schools shall be real continuation schools, but I am most reluctant to allow even for six months a wretched child to attend all the day at the day school and all the evening at the evening school. I think that if a child of tender years has attended properly to school in the day-time it is almost cruel to expect that child to attend at an evening school as well. As to the question of physical instruction in evening schools, I can assure the House that I am as eager as any hon. Member to see that the children, both boys and girls, have proper physical instruction.<lb/>
The hon. Member for West Islington, the hon. Member for North Camberwell, and my hon. friend the Member for West Ham have all been extremely zealous in regard to the case of commercial education generally. My idea of a commercial education differs somewhat from theirs, but I do not doubt that they are genuine in their zeal, and I hope that they will be equally generous to me and believe me when I say that I am not trying to destroy our education or the commercial schools by the policy we have adopted. My idea of a commercial education is not satisfied by merely teaching typewriting and shorthand to boys of ten to fourteen years of age. That is not my notion of a commercial education. Book-keeping as a branch of arithmetic is a very proper subject, and there is no obstacle to its being taught; but typewriting of course
<col>670</col>
is a more technical accomplishment, and so is shorthand, and I do not think, considering the short time there is for general education, that the time of the children should be devoted to teaching them a merely technical art.<lb/>
The hon. Member for North Camber-well was good enough to weary the House by quoting a number of passages from the speech which I made some years ago at the Mansion House, but his quotations do not fairly represent my views. What I said was that the only way by which you can have a good commercial education is by establishing it upon a sound general elementary education, and between the ages of ten and fourteen years the children ought to be undergoing their general education; and to attempt to specialise and teach them what is called a commercial education is merely a waste of time, and will produce results which will be of no value whatever. I should like to be allowed to say on this subject that this question of specialisation in education is one which has exercised very much the attention of those who look upon education from a philosophical point of view. If anybody takes the time and trouble to do what I have had to do as part of ray duties, that is to visit the educational exhibits at the late Paris Exhibition, he will have been struck by a very remarkable divergence between the northern Teutonic and Anglo-Saxon races and the Southern races, like the French and the Italians. The universal principle of the Northern races is general education and the general development of intelligence up to a comparatively late age, and no specialisation before sixteen or seventeen. That principle is carried out, too, in a most remarkable way in America. America is a practical country, a commercial country, a manufacturing country, where everybody is looking to "the main chance," and yet these unphilosophical and practical Americans do not attempt to specialise in any way whatever until a comparatively late age. They do not prepare the child for a particular walk in life, but they give it a general education which is calculated to develop all the faculties of mind and body, and then for the first time they begin to specialise. But that is not so in France, and my hon. friend has been speaking about the French schools. In France, as in Italy and the Southern
<image src="S4V0090P0I0453"/>
<col>671</col>
countries generally, they attempt very early to teach the children what we call something useful. That is to say, at a very early age they begin to give one kind of instruction to a child who is going to be an agricultural labourer, another kind to a child who is going to be a clerk, and so forth. In this way the children are prepared for the course in life which the are expected to follow. It is a very remarkable thing, but I was told by the people with whom I conversed at Paris that the result of the Exhibition had been to very much shake the faith of the French educationists in their own system, and they were very much more inclined to adopt the American system of general education, which was, in the main, the English system of not specialising. That is the policy which the Board of Education have been pursuing in tins country in relation to these higher elementary schools for which we have been so severely handled. The idea of the higher elementary school is that it should be a school giving a general education calculated to develop the faculties of the boys and girls between ten and fourteen. I think that is a very early age to specialise.<lb/>
Then some hon. Member has talked about these schools being pure schools of science. The amount of science which is required in the higher elementary school is four hours per week for the first two years, and six hours per week for the last two years, half of which is to be practical work. That is not more science than can be reasonably acquired in an ordinary general education. There are twenty-five hours in the school week, and, therefore, twenty-one or nineteen available for other than scientific, subjects. It should be remembered that it is not the same science in every school, for there is a great variety which can be taught. The teaching of science is a matter in which there can be an enormous amount of variety. Therefore you have twenty-one hours at the disposal of the school managers for other subjects in the first two years, and you can devote it to your own English language, or even to shorthand and bookkeeping, though I regret enormously the time which school boards I when those children arrive at the age devote to those subjects. Then why, it is asked, are not these large grants given to the ordinary higher grade schools?
<col>672</col>
The Department is tied by its duty to Parliament. There is no power to give these large grants in the Higher Elementary School Minute to any school which does not teach subjects outside of the Elementary School Code, and there is no Parliamentary authority to give grants for anything outside the Code but scientific subjects. The general idea of Parliament is that literary education is provided for by very large endowments, that technical education is provided for by the whiskey money which comes out of the Consolidated Fund, and that science and art and elementary education are provided for by the annual grants of the House of Commons.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02121"><member>MR. ASQUITH <memberconstituency>(Fifeshire, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: You can modify the Code.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02122"><member>SIR J. GORST</member><membercontribution>: Yes, we can modify the Code, but until it is modified it must be observed. Suppose that a higher elementary school is started for teaching boys between twelve and fourteen some special commercial subject such as the Spanish language, for instance. Let me point out this fact. There is another authority in the district which is empowered by Parliament to teach modern languages, and which has Exchequer money given to it by this House for the purpose of enabling it to teach them. What is really proposed is, that having set up a technical instruction committee, say, in the borough of Bradford, for the purpose of teaching Spanish and having the power to teach the Spanish language, we are to set up another authority to teach Spanish which is to receive a large Exchequer grant. Therefore, we should have two schools at Bradford drawing pupils from one another and competing for the same students. It is the most monstrous confusion that you can possibly conceive. I do not think that the is a matter in which there can be an hon. Members who are so zealous for a commercial educational have any idea of this. If instead of agitating for these higher grants you will take the children of the higher grade schools and teach them within the four corners of the Code all the subjects which the Code allows you sound general elementary education, when those children arrive at the age of fourteen or fifteen and leave the elementary school, then they are exactly in the condition to receive a special com-
<image src="S4V0090P0I0454"/>
<col>673</col>
mercial education. If the school boards would give up the idea of keeping the children out of the secondary schools and instead of this prepare them for the secondary schools, and after they have left this course of study, then send them into secondary schools to receive technical education in one, and commercial education in the other, I think you would have your children very much better educated than you will if you persist in keeping the children out of the secondary schools. In this way you give the children the advantages of a much wider education. It is not the hon. Members opposite alone who are zealous for the poor man's child. We are trying to do what is best for his child, but you want to keep the poor man's child perpetually in a school of his own. We want him to mix with the rest of the population, and we want the cleverer of the children of the working classes of this country to mix with other children and with other boys and girls, so that they can ultimately find their way into the universities. Everybody knows how many of the distinguished men in the universities of the land and in our scientific societies have sprung from the ranks of the people. You can never promote the real higher education of the people by shutting them up in a separate school of their own. You want to mix all classes together, and give scholarships and exhibitions by which the best and cleverest children of the working classes can find their way to the universities, and it is in that way only that you will perpetuate that system which has made this country as great as it is.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02123"><member>*MR. MATHER <memberconstituency>(Lancashire. Rossendale)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution>: Any hon. Member who has looked at the crowded Strangers' Gallery to-night must have noticed the intense interest which is taken in this subject by the country as a whole. The old lassitude and lethargy connected with this great subject seem to have passed away. It has passed away not on purely academic grounds, but owing to a fear, which is becoming intensified as the years roll on, that Great Britain stands in danger among the great nations of the world as regards her future during the next twenty-live years. The right hon. Gentleman opposite has used arguments and littered sentiments which do not appear to me to be quite consistent
<col>674</col>
the one with the other. None of us, I think, on this side of the House, or on the other side of the House, will dispute the fact that the, American system of general education for all classes of the community, from the bottom to the top, is the most perfect and symmetrical plan by which the human mind can be trained intelligently for the purposes of life. All classes join together in this system of education. They meet at the primary school, they meet at the grammar school, and pursue their way to the higher schools, and many of them find their way to the colleges eventually. Yon find under the American system all classes of the community mingling together, and nothing in my opinion, is better calculated to make a nation truly great in all its aims and objects than that the children should be educated on the American plan. That is precisely the plan that we advocate on this side of the House, and which many hon. Members on the opposite side desire to see carried out and adopted in England. But to do this you must adopt the American authority, and the American authority is a universal school board in every city of the country. There is scarcely a single exception in all the areas of city life in America where the school board is not elected to take charge of education from the bottom to the top, and it takes entire control. Education is afforded without money and without price to all ranks and classes of the community through public taxation. If that were the system established in this country, none of us would object, but we have cause to complain now of the way in which our children are trained under dual authorities. Under the American system the children pass from the primary school upwards, and if that system was adopted in England, we should have an educated people in a comparatively short space of time. The interest taken in this discussion this evening will make itself felt not only with the Committee, but certainly throughout the entire country, as marking a new departure in the great question of education.<lb/>
I understand that we are about to have introduced during this year many new things. At any rate the Government of the day have promised certain reforms in
<image src="S4V0090P0I0455"/>
<col>675</col>
several directions. But of all the reforms which appear to be most necessary for the salvation of the country, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others who have studied this question for many years, a reform in our national education stands the first; and it also stands the first in the estimation of the country. In the discussion of this great national question we have had an empty Front Ministerial Bench, and rather a small attendance in Committee, but the interest outside in this question has been manifested to-night by the very large number of the public present here. I believe that next Friday we are to have another reform introduced into this House in connection with the Army. Upon that occasion the Front Bench opposite and all the benches in the House will be crowded, and it will be difficult to get a seat in the House. But I maintain that this question of national education should precede all other reforms, because even Army reform depends for its efficiency upon educational reform. I do ask the right hon. Gentleman to take it most seriously into his consideration, because it must be evident from what he has heard during the debate to-day and from his own experience outside, that at least the people of this country have come to the conclusion that we can no longer face the future upon the basis of that want of intelligence and that inadequate provision for general education which we have been passing through during the last twenty-five years. We are thankful for the small progress achieved, but that has only made us feel more acutely than ever what a vast difference there is between the advantages of the working classes in this country and those enjoyed by America and Germany when they come face to face with the real purposes of life. I am a large manufacturer, and we engineers of England are in a position to compare our industry with those large industries carried on on the other side of the Atlantic and in Germany. It must be within the knowledge of every Member of the Committee that during the last ten years there has been a gradual encroachment upon all the industries for which this country was distinguished in former years. Our supremacy has been challenged and undermined. This has not
<col>676</col>
happened for want of natural resources, or for want of coal, iron, copper or other raw materials which we obtain from all parts of the earth by a splendid development of the shipping interest. The difficulty is that the human material is not as competent now to deal with the scientific and industrial problems of the day as it was twenty-five years ago. The rest of the world has gone ahead, and has got into line with us, and even passed us in many industries. Those engaged in scientific industries naturally ask why it is that we cannot maintain this supremacy in the future; why we fear the competition of to-day. There is only one palpable reason, which stares us in the face all the time, and that is the lack of that cultivated intelligence amongst the industrial classes which is necessary to enable us to carry on our industries in the scientific manner which the world demands in all directions. Only the other day I came across a remarkable illustration of this point. I was asked to obtain an English chemical analyst for a large manufacturing firm abroad, and after looking round for weeks, I could only find four who were in any sense competent to come up to the necessary requirements. On the other side of the water I could have found scores where I could only find one here. That kind of thing disheartens industry when looking to the future. I will ask the right hon. Gentleman, if he doubts my experience, or the results of it, to consult any large employer of labour, engaged in any scientific industry in this country, and he will find that one and all of them experience the greatest difficulty in getting proper human material to face the great problems which have to be met. I think that is the greatest obstacle to our maintaining the supremacy which we formerly held amongst the nations of the world.<lb/>
For these reasons, is it not the duty of the Government to throw aside all other considerations, and give all that we require for the reform of our national system of education? The right hon. Gentleman stated in regard to the 17s. 6d. limit that the matter depended upon the Treasury. Any Government worthy of the name that wishes to meet our enemies not only in the field but also those in our own household&#x2014;any Government capable of recognising the signs of
<image src="S4V0090P0I0456"/>
<col>677</col>
the times and which desires to meet these enemies, surely ought to regard national education as one of the most important questions to which it could devote the money of the people. The Treasury should be made to feel tins, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the House, and the gentlemen who rule the destinies of the nation, should recognise the fact that we at least on this side of the House are willing to bury the hatchet of discord so far as all the minor differences of a national system of education are concerned, and are willing to support the Government as we did in the passing of the Technical Instruction Bill of 1889&#x2014; which would never have passed but for our action on this side of the House. We are willing to go with them and justify their action in our constituencies, if they will only give us the chance by establishing once and for all a system under one large authority, without making any lines of demarcation to differentiate between the education necessary for the working classes and for the middle classes of the country, and all classes up to that stage of culture to which some of them may aspire later on. I have done what I could in my business to encourage the spirit of education among parents, for I have stipulated that in my works no apprentice shall be taken under sixteen years of age who has not undergone a regular course of higher instruction. Age alone cannot be the test. You cannot differentiate between the ages of fifteen and sixteen. Elementary science should be a subject of common and general education in our primary schools, and to teach something of the laws of nature is to make a child understand the A B C of science. There is no difficult about explaining to a child the nature of the atmosphere he breathes, or the manner in which we obtain water by means of a pump, or the difference between a vacuum and air pressure, or the forces of nature. All these things meet him through the ordinary course of his life, and they can be brought before him in the schoolroom at the age of fourteen or fifteen just as well as they can be at the age of eighteen.<lb/>
I earnestly press upon the right lion. Gentleman to take it from the Committee's attitude to-night that we are
<col>678</col>
really in earnest. I have never heard the House of Commons so much in earnest as it has been to-night on this great question of national education. Outside the House the right hon. Gentleman needs no proof that the country is aroused upon this important matter. We have the example of other nations before us. It is a matter for irony for us to be now discussing what the English nation requires in education for her future destiny. We are the oldest nation of the world in the modern sense of the word, and should be the most advanced. The right hon. Gentleman has now a splendid opportunity, for the House is ready and more than eager to support him in every way it can, and if he will only make the Cabinet understand how much in earnest the House is, and still more the country, then I think we shall have reached a very happy period in our history. A new reign has just dawned upon us. We have a now monarch and a new Parliament, and we have entered on a new century. Let it be recorded in our history that this was a time when a new national system of education was established throughout the length and breadth of the land, and then I believe the country will once more rise to great achievements.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02124"><member>*Mr. BOND <memberconstituency>(Nottingham, E.)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said that in the earlier part of the debate his right hon. friend the Member for South Aberdeen gave an account of the way in which the higher grade schools came into existence. Those who were acquainted with the history of this educational movement knew that here and there up and down the country it began by pressing education beyond the standards of the Code, which it was perceived could be got through by children of average ability long before the time at which it was desirable that they should leave school. The consequence was that schools began to be established which had since been known as higher grade schools. It was recognised that when they got beyond the standards of the Code they could no longer use the rates for the support of those schools, and the result was that though the children were still kept in the buildings the education was supposed to be paid for partly by fees, partly by the grants from the Science and Art
<image src="S4V0090P0I0457"/>
<col>679</col>
Department. Subsequently, however, the fees were diminished, and in some cases entirely abolished. The grants of the Science and Art Department were diminished or were less easily obtained, and the consequence was that schools of this kind, established to meet a real want, found themselves obliged to carry on in a manner which in the earlier stage of their existence they would have considered to be illegal. Then there came a still further development in the schools of the great northern towns. In London, where the higher grade schools had only lately been developed, the object of establishing them was not so much to fill an ascertained gap in education as to increase the prestige of the School Board, and really enter into competition with existing secondary schools. That had happened to his knowledge to a very large extent, and the difficulty in the matter was that the masters conducting the higher grade schools were naturally desirous of keeping the children in the schools instead of willingly relinquishing them to the secondary schools, to the detriment not only of the education of the children, but to the great detriment of the secondary schools. Children were now kept at the higher grade schools until they were about fifteen, and then because it was found that they would have a better chance of obtaining certain kinds of employment if they came from a secondary school they were sent to such a school for what was thought to be a finishing year. That was bad for the education of the children and disadvantageous to the secondary schools.<lb/>
There were two great things to be considered in connection with the matter. One was that the Act of 1870 was intended to provide for the elementary education of the great mass of the people &#x2014;labourers, artisans, soldiers, policemen, and the men filling the lower ranks of the Civil Service. At what age would such people begin to earn their livelihood? Was it possible in the conditions of our social system&#x2014;even though he thought it desirable&#x2014;that such children as those for whom the elementary system of education was devised could remain at school beyond the age of fourteen? He heard with great interest the statement of the hon. Gentleman opposite about not taking apprentices into his works until they
<col>680</col>
were sixteen. But from the way in which the hon. Gentleman announced the fact he evidently regarded it as exceptional. Elementary education was now free, or practically free, and question was whether the Committee was prepared to go any further in the direction of making education, to a higher degree, gratuitous? The higher grade schools had one great attraction in the eyes of parents, and that was that no fees were payable at them&#x2014;at least in London. Another difficulty was the comparative lateness of the age at which scholars now entered the secondary schools. That was a real danger to education. They were not at liberty to treat education as consisting of a number of different stages, like a house of cards<sup>*</sup>. Education properly understood was a much more serious matter than that. It was a matter of organic growth, so far as it could be secured, of drawing on the child stage by stage, from subject to subject, and in the end turning him out as complete a social instrument as he could be turned out having regard to the time ho remained at school. He confessed that the situation presented very great difficulties. School boards and schoolmasters and mistresses in elementary schools, actuated no doubt by very laudable motives and desirous of doing their very best for the education I of the children confided to their care, had departed from the plain course prescribed for them by the Elementary Education Act, and had unquestionably encroached on the field of secondary education. They did it in many cases with the assent, approval, and recognition of the inhabitants of the districts in which the development had taken place, and with the left-handed recognition of the Education Department. Now that the illegality of such action was being discussed, they were confronted with what was certainly a difficult, delicate, and awkward question. The schools which had been established were doing good work, and work which met with the approval of the bulk of the inhabitants I of the districts where it was being carried on. It would be extremely difficult to shut them up altogether, and he himself thought that the conclusion which had been arrived at by some 6i the speakers in the debate was a right
<image src="S4V0090P0I0458"/>
<col>681</col>
conclusion, and that the only way of getting a really satisfactory system of education, which would provide necessary instruction up to the age of about sixteen, was to establish either one central authority or several local authorities to deal with the whole subject. There were however immense perils and difficulties in that plan. They could not remodel their education system in that way without a very large increase of expenditure. Hon. Members on both sides seemed prepared for that, but no hon. Member had given any figures to indicate what the cost would lie. At present education was practically free up to the age of fifteen or thereabouts.<lb/>
If they wished to go further, and provide State education for children remaining at school until the age of seventeen or thereabouts, and to eliminate the unhappy jealousies which had prevailed for a long time between the elementary and secondary schools, the only way to proceed, so far as he could see, was to fall back on some such plan as had been suggested. He hoped that when the Bill which had been promised was introduced it would be found to contain provisions for the consolidation of education authorities in different districts, so that the entire system from beginning to end might be worked harmoniously on a definite plan.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02125"><member>Mr. ASQUITH</member><membercontribution>: I shall not detain the Committee for more than two or three minutes. As this has been such a remarkable debate, it may lie desirable before we proceed to a division for one to endeavour to summarise its main features. It is certainly the first time in my experience of the House of Commons in which practically a whole evening, nominally devoted to a Vote on Account embracing all the branches of the Civil Service, has been entirely occupied by the one topic we are engaged on. We hear a great deal, rightly and justly, about the necessity of reforming some of our public Departments, the War Office, and so on; but I think the manner in which the House has occupied its time to-night is the most significant proof the country could have that we look on the reform of our educational system as coming first and foremost. I think, without any distinction of party, we may recognise that as a hopeful
<col>682</col>
sign, because it shows that not merely has the debate been contributed to almost equally by both sides of the House; not merely that we are full of hope and desire for the future, bin that we are animated by what I conceive to be a just and legitimate apprehension as to our existing educational position.<lb/>
My hon. friend the Member for Rossendale, in his speech a few minutes ago, and speaking with his long experience as a large employer of labour, emphasised in. I think, not at all accentuated or exaggerated terms, the enormous danger to which the industries of this country are exposed, not from any falling off in the energy or even in the intelligence of either our capitalists or labourers, but from the superiority in methods of training which have been adopted by our leading competitors in the industrial world. For the first time in the history of this country,-indeed in the history of the world, the exports of a foreign country during the last twelve months have exceeded, our own and if ever there were an occasion when it was time for us to look round and put our educational house in order that occasion has now arrived. There is also another point which has found ample expression during the course of this debate, and that is that whatever differences we may have had in the past or may have in the future&#x2014;and J do not in the least disguise or minimise their importance&#x2014;as to the position of denominational schools on the one side and board schools on the other, there is a certain neutral ground in the direction of educational improvement on which all parties in this House may meet. The greatest educational reform which has taken place in our time was carried out under the conduct of my right hon. friend&#x2014;I mean the providing of free education in our primary schools. That was a matter on which there was no division of party opinion, and the measure was carried into law practically with the consent of all parties. There is another illustration, not perhaps so wide-reaching in its effects, but not to be ignored&#x2014;I refer to the Technical Instruction Act of 1899. That Act, I am sorry to say, was circumscribed in its extent, but it has already produced, and will, if largely extended, continue to produce, the foundations of a system of technical
<image src="S4V0090P0I0459"/>
<col>683</col>
education throughout the length and breadth of the country. Having regard to the manifest indications of a universally dominating interest in this matter, and to the willingness of all parties in the State to co-operate in the solution of it, cannot the Government give us this year&#x2014;they have an unexampled opportunity&#x2014;a chance of making a really large step forward?<lb/>
There are two measures to which I desire particularly to refer. The first is what may he done by legislation, and the other is what may be done by administration. As regards legislation, I think it is universally acknowledged that the time has come when we may really take a practical step towards the attainment of what has long been an educational ideal&#x2014;namely, the co-ordination of our various systems of primary, secondary and more developed education into something like a harmonious and logical system. Speaker after speaker has pointed out to-night that a clever child, the child with brains, who has passed through a primary school, finds himself in the next stage very much handicapped by want of adequate provision for his more developed education, and very often cut short at a time when, if he had proper facilities and opportunities, he might be able to develop his education to a degree which would make him a really efficient worker in the development of the industries and science of the country.<lb/>
That is a matter of course as to which we must suspend our judgment until we see the scheme of the Government, but I want to lay even still greater stress on the necessity and urgency of a reform which does not depend upon legislation at all, but which could be carried out to-morrow by a stroke of the Vice-President's pen. There are a number of children who have reached the age of twelve or thirteen, and who from the necessities of the case&#x2014;the circumstances of their parents and so forth&#x2014;can probably never hope to mount up the higher rungs of the educational ladder, or obtain the advantages which a secondary and more developed system of education would provide. If the law is to be interpreted in the sense in which it has been interpreted by the Courts, these children
<col>684</col>
will be left absolutely stranded during two of the most important and critical years of their lives. Having passed the sixth or even the seventh standard, and being still at a school age, and in the elementary schools, they will be left absolutely stranded and compelled to go without any further education. Well, I say to the Vice-President and to His Majesty's Government, if they will modify and mould the Code issued from Whitehall so as to continue the facilities which are now provided in the higher branches of elementary schools, but of which they are threatened to be deprived, they will provide for this class of children, who really may not have another chance in their lives, the only possible means of developing their minds and faculties and making them capable and efficient citizens. That is absolutely within the power of the right hon, Gentleman to-morrow, if he wishes to exercise his statutory rights to bring it into effect. I earnestly hope and believe that the debate to-night will supply an impulse and incentive to the Government to carry out these two steps, and I hope that such a favourable opportunity will not be lost.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S4V0090P0-02126"><member>MAJOR RASCH <memberconstituency>(Essex, Chelmsford)</memberconstituency></member><membercontribution> said he did not pretend to be an expert in educational matters. In the agricultural districts education was sometimes regarded as a great advantage and at other times as an unmitigated nuisance, but he did not propose to express his own views on the subject. He only wished to say that he desired to support the view put forward by the hon. Member for Accrington with reference to the security of the tenure of teachers in elementary schools. The teachers were subject to irresponsible Boards, and if they went to church or to chapel, if they played the organ or refused to play the organ, or accepted the eastern position, they were liable to dismissal and had no appeal. All they asked was that there should be an appeal to the county councils or to the Vice-President himself. For the last year and a half he and other hon. Members had been pressing the matter on the Vice-President of the Council without the slightest effect; they only received the usual official answer that the matter was being considered. When the right
<image src="S4V0090P0I0460"/>
<col>685</col>
hon. Gentleman was asked a supplementary question, lie only said his answer was veracious. It was, however, un-commonly unsatisfactory. The right hon. Gentleman said just now that the question was under consideration, but if the Duke of Devonshire could not make up his</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S4V0090P0-02151"><member>*THE CHAIRMAN</member><membercontribution>: Mr. Speaker, I have to report to you. Sir, that during the course of the division on the question which I was ordered to put by the House as a result of the division upon the closure, a certain number of Members of the House declined to leave their seats and to proceed into the division lobbies. I requested them more than once to proceed, but I gathered from the observations which fell from these hon. Members, or some of them, that they declined to proceed. Thereupon I thought it was due to the House, in the position in which we found ourselves, that I should follow the precedent which had been set on a former occasion and ask you, Sir, to return to the Chair. It was impossible for me, Sir, to see all the hon. Members who declined to leave their seats, but I may say that among those whom I was able to observe were the Members for South-East Cork, North Kerry, South Tipperary, North Meath, North Leitrim, East Limerick, North-East Cork, West Cavan, East Tyrone, South Fermanagh, East Cork, and West Cork.</membercontribution></p>

I sympathise with the protest of my hon. friends, and if a way out is not found, then the same course as that which we have just witnessed will have to be gone through with every Member on these benches. I would appeal, if I may, through you, Sir, to the Leader of the House, and ask him if he would not let the matter now end. I think that by allowing the House to be now adjourned, we might meet in a better temper all round to-morrow. If that suggestion cannot be adopted, then I see no other alternative to every Member on these benches being forcibly removed.

Members, whether they agree with the course that has been taken in the House or not, should respect the order of the House first. An order having been made and a division called, and the hon. Members having been named for refusing to proceed to the lobby, they should retire from the House decently. A protest may be made on a proper occasion, but their duty now is to retire peaceably.</membercontribution></p>
